Rafah is the main route in and out of the Gaza Strip that is not controlled by Israel, and the focus of efforts to deliver aid to Gaza\\u2019s 2.3 million residents. Israel imposed a total blockade and launched air strikes on Gaza in response to a deadly attack on Israeli soil by Palestinian group Hamas on Oct. 7. Hamas, which has controlled Gaza since 2007, said a relief aid convoy of 20 trucks would enter on Saturday, carrying medicine, medical supplies and a limited amount of food and canned goods. The U.N. has warned of \\u201chumanitarian catastrophe\\u201d in Gaza, where food has been running out and supplies of fuel needed to keep hospital back-up generators running have reached dangerously low levels. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres visited the border on Friday in a push to get the aid in, saying a mechanism for inspection of the aid demanded by Israel was still being worked out. Many of Gaza\\u2019s residents have crammed into the south of the territory to avoid air strikes in the north. \\nSource: Reuters\\n-Agencies\"\n",

They are the first hostages to be freed since fighters from the Palestinian group carried out a surprise attack on October 7, killing at least 1,400 people and taking about 200 others hostage. Hamas\\u2019\\u00a0armed wing, the Ezzedeen al-Qassam Brigades, freed the hostages \\u201cfor humanitarian reasons\\u201d after Qatari mediation efforts, its spokesman Abu Ubaida said on Friday. The Israeli prime minister\\u2019s office confirmed that Judith Raanan and her daughter Natalie Raanan had been released and were in the country. US President Joe Biden in a statement thanked Qatar and Israel for their partnership in securing the pair\\u2019s release. A spokesperson for Qatar\\u2019s foreign ministry said the release of the US hostages came after \\u201cmany days of continuous communication with all parties\\u201d. \\nQatar hopes dialogue will lead to the \\u201crelease of all civilian hostages from every nationality\\u201d, the spokesperson said. The International Committee of the Red Cross confirmed that it contributed to the effort to free the two United States citizens. \\u201cThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) helped facilitate this release by transporting the hostages from Gaza to Israel, underscoring the real-life impact of our role as a neutral actor between the warring parties,\\u201d the organisation said in a statement. \\u201cThe ICRC continues to call for the immediate release of all hostages. We are ready to visit the remaining hostages and to facilitate any future release following an agreement reached by the parties. Hamas had said earlier in the day that it was releasing the two captives in response to diplomatic efforts by Qatar. The Israeli military said earlier on Friday that it believed that the majority of the captives were still alive. Most of the 1,400 people killed in the Hamas attack were civilians, according to Israeli officials. Israel has responded with a relentless bombardment that has killed at least 4,137 people in the Gaza Strip, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also imposed a \\u201ccomplete siege\\u201d of the enclave and said it will not be lifted unless Israeli hostages are freed. Those held include women, children, the elderly and people from other countries, which have been working for their release, along with some Israeli soldiers.

      "    \"content\": \"State Minister for Finance Shehan Semasinghe says the agreement reached with the IMF and the staff-level agreement reached following the First Review of Sri Lanka\\u2019s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement will help settle arrears owed to multilateral creditors while expediting the debt restructuring process. The lawmaker has further said that Sri Lanka is poised to receive the second tranche of USD 330 million subsequent to the approval of this Staff-Level Agreement by the IMF Executive Board, according to the President\\u2019s Media Division (PMD). Semasinghe made these remarks at a press conference held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC), on Friday (Oct. 20) under the theme \\u2018Collective Path to a stable country\\u2019. In his further remarks, the state minister elaborated: \\u201cLast night, we successfully reached the staff-level agreement, a crucial step in securing the second tranche under our agreement with the IMF through the Extended Fund Facility. Prior to this achievement, a team from the International Monetary Fund conducted an extensive two-week review in Sri Lanka, engaging in detailed discussions on various topics. Given the complexity and scope of the discussions, it was not feasible to reach an agreement instantly. \\u201cSubsequently, we continued our deliberations during the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, held in Morocco. There, we engaged in in-depth discussions to clarify various aspects. Even then, we found it necessary to seek further clarifications on various matters, leading to continued discussions through online platform once we returned to Sri Lanka. The agreement, as it stands today, is the result of concerted efforts and dialogues involving officials from the International Monetary Fund, the Central Bank, and the Ministry of Finance. \\u201cDespite the favourable position Sri Lanka held with the International Monetary Fund in March 2023, subsequent disruptions and misinterpretations arose in recent weeks. State Minister Semasinghe emphasized, \\u201cWe categorically stated within and outside of Parliament that there is no reason to fear the approval of the executive committee or the release of the second instalment. As a government, we maintained our confidence.\\u201d Semasinghe underscored that the staff-level agreement, marking the completion of the first review of the program with the IMF, plays a pivotal role in facilitating the payment of arrears to multilateral creditors and expediting the process of debt restructuring. He reiterated that Sri Lanka is set to receive the second tranche of USD 330 million following the approval of the IMF\\u2019s Executive Board. Additionally, he has acknowledged the leadership and the guidance of President Ranil Wickremesinghe in these endeavours, as well as the contributions of officials, including the Governor of the Central Bank and the Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, in making these achievements possible, the PMD said. He noted that the staff-level agreement will enable the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and other multilateral financial institutions to make the remaining payments, further expediting debt restructuring efforts with international partners. The state minister expressed optimism that agreements related to debt restructuring may soon be finalized, aligning with the government\\u2019s objectives of reducing corruption and increasing transparency. He cited the IMF\\u2019s praise for Sri Lanka\\u2019s economic progress and noted that this reflects international confidence in the country\\u2019s economic prospects.\"\n",

      "    \"content\": \"A man of Sri Lankan origins living in Australia has pleaded guilty to obtaining financial advantage by deception in a bid to put on T20 cricket tournaments featuring high-profile international players. Navishta Desilva, 36, had reportedly defrauded his employer of nearly AUD 250,000. He funnelled most of the money into events his personal company Global Talent Entertainment was organising featuring his cricket club Endeavour Hills and a star-studded line-up of international cricketers. There is no suggestion Endeavour Hills or the players were aware of any wrongdoing. Mr Desilva turned to fraud after sponsorship funding for the events fell through, the Victorian County Court heard on Friday. \\u201cIt seems to stem from immaturity and grandiose ideas,\\u201d Judge Brookes told the court. Dressed in a dark suit with open collar, Mr Desilva spoke softly as he pleaded guilty to one count of obtaining a financial advantage by deception. Over the course of 16 months between March 2021 and July 2022, Desilva arranged for 18 different purchase orders from Omnivision to CCTV master, a legitimate business which supplied his employer with surveillance cameras. By setting up a fake email address pretending to be from CCTV Master, Desilva was able to send fake invoices to Omnivision for inflated amounts which he funnelled into his own bank account. The fraud was noticed when an ex-colleague of Desilva\\u2019s audited the transactions he had been involved with after he left the company in July 2022. He has since repaid the money by working nights as a labourer in addition to a 9-5 job, and borrowing money from friends and family, defence barrister Sam Norton told the court. The court heard Mr Desilva had enjoyed a promising youth career as a cricketer, representing Sri Lanka at U-15 level and playing for the same club as legend of the game Kumar Sangakarra. When his dreams of a cricket career fell flat, he migrated to Australia at the age of 20, where he worked in a series of jobs including three years in auditing at Deloitte. Judge Brookes warned Mr Desilva he could be jailed for the \\u201cdevious and prolonged\\u201d offending. \\u201cThis is the sort of offence where ordinarily the community expects a period of jail,\\u201d Judge Brookes said, noting that Mr Desilva\\u2019s job at Deloitte would have given him the skills required to pull off the fraud. Toni Stokes, prosecuting, implored the judge to impose a prison term for the \\u201cvery serious offending\\u201d, noting that Mr Desilva had been convicted of a similar offence a decade earlier. Mr Desilva will return to court for sentencing on October 30. --Agencies\"\n",

      "    \"content\": \"U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres visited the Rafah border crossing on Friday and said aid trucks needed to move as quickly as possible from Egypt into the besieged Palestinian enclave of Gaza to alleviate a humanitarian crisis. The crossing has become a focus of attention since Israel began its mass bombing of Gaza in retaliation for a deadly assault by the Hamas militant group on southern Israel on Oct.7. Gaza is running short of fuel, food, water and medicine but the Egyptian-controlled border has remained shut while various parties wrangle over terms for allowing aid to flow in. Guterres flew to Egypt on Friday in a push to get the trucks moving. \\u201cThese trucks are not just trucks - they are a lifeline, they are the difference between life and death to many people in Gaza,\\u201d he said, speaking on the Egyptian side of the crossing. \\u201cTo see them stuck here makes me very clear - what we need is to make them move, to make them move to the other side of this wall to make them move as quickly as possible and as many as possible.\\u201d Gutteres, dressed in a dark suit under the desert sun, also called for a swift system of verification of the aid shipments. \\u201cWe are now actively engaging with all the parties, actively engaging with Egypt, with Israel, with the US, in order to make sure that we are able to clarify those conditions...in order to have as soon as possible these trucks moving to where they are needed,\\u201d he said. He was swarmed by Egyptian protesters chanting pro-Palestinian slogans as he spoke. In Geneva, the U.N. humanitarian office said it was in advanced talks with all parties in the Israel-Hamas conflict to ensure an aid operation can soon get underway in Gaza. Earlier, the United States had said details of a deal to send aid through the Rafah crossing were still being hammered out. Agreement had been reached for the passage of the first 20 trucks, it also said. This would still only be a fraction of what is required. Before the outbreak of conflict, about 450 aid trucks were arriving there daily. Most of Gaza\\u2019s 2.3 million people depend on humanitarian aid. The coastal enclave has been under a blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt since Hamas took control of it in 2007. In Geneva, Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said Gaza was in dire need of water, food, fuel and medical supplies. \\u201cWe are in deep and advanced negotiations with all relevant sides to ensure that an aid operation into Gaza starts as quickly as possible and with the right conditions,\\u201d he said. STAY OR EVACUATE? Rafah is the only crossing with Gaza for goods and people that does not border Israel. Efforts to get aid into Gaza have been complicated by the need to agree on a mechanism to inspect the aid, and a push to evacuate foreign passport holders from Gaza. Roads leading into Gaza are being repaired after being hit by bombardments in the past two weeks. A U.N. official said more than 200 trucks of aid were ready to move from Sinai to Gaza. During previous conflicts, aid had been delivered to Gaza during humanitarian pauses through the Kerem Shalom crossing, which is controlled by Israel. But Israel has said it will allow no aid to enter from its territory until Hamas releases the hostages it took during its Oct. 7 attack. It has said aid can enter through Egypt as long as it does not end up in the hands of Hamas. Egypt has said it will not accept any mass displacement of Gazans into Sinai, reflecting Arab fears that Palestinians could again flee or be forced from their homes en masse, as they were during the war surrounding Israel\\u2019s creation. Egypt is also concerned by security in northeastern Sinai, where it faced an Islamist insurgency that escalated a decade ago, and by the risk of any spillover from Hamas-controlled Gaza. \\nSource: Reuters\\n-Agencies\"\n",

Semasinghe made these remarks at a press conference held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC), on Friday (Oct. 20) under the theme \\u2018Collective Path to a stable country\\u2019. In his further remarks, the state minister elaborated: \\u201cLast night, we successfully reached the staff-level agreement, a crucial step in securing the second tranche under our agreement with the IMF through the Extended Fund Facility. Prior to this achievement, a team from the International Monetary Fund conducted an extensive two-week review in Sri Lanka, engaging in detailed discussions on various topics. Given the complexity and scope of the discussions, it was not feasible to reach an agreement instantly. \\u201cSubsequently, we continued our deliberations during the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, held in Morocco. There, we engaged in in-depth discussions to clarify various aspects. Even then, we found it necessary to seek further clarifications on various matters, leading to continued discussions through online platform once we returned to Sri Lanka. The agreement, as it stands today, is the result of concerted efforts and dialogues involving officials from the International Monetary Fund, the Central Bank, and the Ministry of Finance. \\u201cDespite the favourable position Sri Lanka held with the International Monetary Fund in March 2023, subsequent disruptions and misinterpretations arose in recent weeks. State Minister Semasinghe emphasized, \\u201cWe categorically stated within and outside of Parliament that there is no reason to fear the approval of the executive committee or the release of the second instalment. As a government, we maintained our confidence.\\u201d Semasinghe underscored that the staff-level agreement, marking the completion of the first review of the program with the IMF, plays a pivotal role in facilitating the payment of arrears to multilateral creditors and expediting the process of debt restructuring. He reiterated that Sri Lanka is set to receive the second tranche of USD 330 million following the approval of the IMF\\u2019s Executive Board. Additionally, he has acknowledged the leadership and the guidance of President Ranil Wickremesinghe in these endeavours, as well as the contributions of officials, including the Governor of the Central Bank and the Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, in making these achievements possible, the PMD said. He noted that the staff-level agreement will enable the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and other multilateral financial institutions to make the remaining payments, further expediting debt restructuring efforts with international partners. The state minister expressed optimism that agreements related to debt restructuring may soon be finalized, aligning with the government\\u2019s objectives of reducing corruption and increasing transparency.

      "    \"content\": \"A man of Sri Lankan origins living in Australia has pleaded guilty to obtaining financial advantage by deception in a bid to put on T20 cricket tournaments featuring high-profile international players. Navishta Desilva, 36, had reportedly defrauded his employer of nearly AUD 250,000. He funnelled most of the money into events his personal company Global Talent Entertainment was organising featuring his cricket club Endeavour Hills and a star-studded line-up of international cricketers. There is no suggestion Endeavour Hills or the players were aware of any wrongdoing. Mr Desilva turned to fraud after sponsorship funding for the events fell through, the Victorian County Court heard on Friday. \\u201cIt seems to stem from immaturity and grandiose ideas,\\u201d Judge Brookes told the court. Dressed in a dark suit with open collar, Mr Desilva spoke softly as he pleaded guilty to one count of obtaining a financial advantage by deception. Over the course of 16 months between March 2021 and July 2022, Desilva arranged for 18 different purchase orders from Omnivision to CCTV master, a legitimate business which supplied his employer with surveillance cameras. By setting up a fake email address pretending to be from CCTV Master, Desilva was able to send fake invoices to Omnivision for inflated amounts which he funnelled into his own bank account. The fraud was noticed when an ex-colleague of Desilva\\u2019s audited the transactions he had been involved with after he left the company in July 2022. He has since repaid the money by working nights as a labourer in addition to a 9-5 job, and borrowing money from friends and family, defence barrister Sam Norton told the court. The court heard Mr Desilva had enjoyed a promising youth career as a cricketer, representing Sri Lanka at U-15 level and playing for the same club as legend of the game Kumar Sangakarra. When his dreams of a cricket career fell flat, he migrated to Australia at the age of 20, where he worked in a series of jobs including three years in auditing at Deloitte. Judge Brookes warned Mr Desilva he could be jailed for the \\u201cdevious and prolonged\\u201d offending. \\u201cThis is the sort of offence where ordinarily the community expects a period of jail,\\u201d Judge Brookes said, noting that Mr Desilva\\u2019s job at Deloitte would have given him the skills required to pull off the fraud. Toni Stokes, prosecuting, implored the judge to impose a prison term for the \\u201cvery serious offending\\u201d, noting that Mr Desilva had been convicted of a similar offence a decade earlier. Mr Desilva will return to court for sentencing on October 30. --Agencies\"\n",

      "    \"content\": \"U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres visited the Rafah border crossing on Friday and said aid trucks needed to move as quickly as possible from Egypt into the besieged Palestinian enclave of Gaza to alleviate a humanitarian crisis. The crossing has become a focus of attention since Israel began its mass bombing of Gaza in retaliation for a deadly assault by the Hamas militant group on southern Israel on Oct.7. Gaza is running short of fuel, food, water and medicine but the Egyptian-controlled border has remained shut while various parties wrangle over terms for allowing aid to flow in. Guterres flew to Egypt on Friday in a push to get the trucks moving. \\u201cThese trucks are not just trucks - they are a lifeline, they are the difference between life and death to many people in Gaza,\\u201d he said, speaking on the Egyptian side of the crossing. \\u201cTo see them stuck here makes me very clear - what we need is to make them move, to make them move to the other side of this wall to make them move as quickly as possible and as many as possible.\\u201d Gutteres, dressed in a dark suit under the desert sun, also called for a swift system of verification of the aid shipments. \\u201cWe are now actively engaging with all the parties, actively engaging with Egypt, with Israel, with the US, in order to make sure that we are able to clarify those conditions...in order to have as soon as possible these trucks moving to where they are needed,\\u201d he said. He was swarmed by Egyptian protesters chanting pro-Palestinian slogans as he spoke. In Geneva, the U.N. humanitarian office said it was in advanced talks with all parties in the Israel-Hamas conflict to ensure an aid operation can soon get underway in Gaza. Earlier, the United States had said details of a deal to send aid through the Rafah crossing were still being hammered out. Agreement had been reached for the passage of the first 20 trucks, it also said. This would still only be a fraction of what is required. Before the outbreak of conflict, about 450 aid trucks were arriving there daily. Most of Gaza\\u2019s 2.3 million people depend on humanitarian aid. The coastal enclave has been under a blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt since Hamas took control of it in 2007. In Geneva, Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said Gaza was in dire need of water, food, fuel and medical supplies. \\u201cWe are in deep and advanced negotiations with all relevant sides to ensure that an aid operation into Gaza starts as quickly as possible and with the right conditions,\\u201d he said. STAY OR EVACUATE? Rafah is the only crossing with Gaza for goods and people that does not border Israel. Efforts to get aid into Gaza have been complicated by the need to agree on a mechanism to inspect the aid, and a push to evacuate foreign passport holders from Gaza. Roads leading into Gaza are being repaired after being hit by bombardments in the past two weeks. A U.N. official said more than 200 trucks of aid were ready to move from Sinai to Gaza. During previous conflicts, aid had been delivered to Gaza during humanitarian pauses through the Kerem Shalom crossing, which is controlled by Israel. But Israel has said it will allow no aid to enter from its territory until Hamas releases the hostages it took during its Oct. 7 attack. It has said aid can enter through Egypt as long as it does not end up in the hands of Hamas. Egypt has said it will not accept any mass displacement of Gazans into Sinai, reflecting Arab fears that Palestinians could again flee or be forced from their homes en masse, as they were during the war surrounding Israel\\u2019s creation. Egypt is also concerned by security in northeastern Sinai, where it faced an Islamist insurgency that escalated a decade ago, and by the risk of any spillover from Hamas-controlled Gaza. \\nSource: Reuters\\n-Agencies\"\n",

      "    \"content\": \"Hamas has released two American hostages, Judith Raanan and her daughter Natalie Raanan, who were kidnapped in its attack on southern Israel. They are the first hostages to be freed since fighters from the Palestinian group carried out a surprise attack on October 7, killing at least 1,400 people and taking about 200 others hostage. Hamas\\u2019\\u00a0armed wing, the Ezzedeen al-Qassam Brigades, freed the hostages \\u201cfor humanitarian reasons\\u201d after Qatari mediation efforts, its spokesman Abu Ubaida said on Friday. The Israeli prime minister\\u2019s office confirmed that Judith Raanan and her daughter Natalie Raanan had been released and were in the country. US President Joe Biden in a statement thanked Qatar and Israel for their partnership in securing the pair\\u2019s release. A spokesperson for Qatar\\u2019s foreign ministry said the release of the US hostages came after \\u201cmany days of continuous communication with all parties\\u201d. \\nQatar hopes dialogue will lead to the \\u201crelease of all civilian hostages from every nationality\\u201d, the spokesperson said. The International Committee of the Red Cross confirmed that it contributed to the effort to free the two United States citizens. \\u201cThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) helped facilitate this release by transporting the hostages from Gaza to Israel, underscoring the real-life impact of our role as a neutral actor between the warring parties,\\u201d the organisation said in a statement. \\u201cThe ICRC continues to call for the immediate release of all hostages. We are ready to visit the remaining hostages and to facilitate any future release following an agreement reached by the parties. Hamas had said earlier in the day that it was releasing the two captives in response to diplomatic efforts by Qatar. The Israeli military said earlier on Friday that it believed that the majority of the captives were still alive. Most of the 1,400 people killed in the Hamas attack were civilians, according to Israeli officials. Israel has responded with a relentless bombardment that has killed at least 4,137 people in the Gaza Strip, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also imposed a \\u201ccomplete siege\\u201d of the enclave and said it will not be lifted unless Israeli hostages are freed. Those held include women, children, the elderly and people from other countries, which have been working for their release, along with some Israeli soldiers.

The lawmaker has further said that Sri Lanka is poised to receive the second tranche of USD 330 million subsequent to the approval of this Staff-Level Agreement by the IMF Executive Board, according to the President\\u2019s Media Division (PMD). Semasinghe made these remarks at a press conference held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC), on Friday (Oct. 20) under the theme \\u2018Collective Path to a stable country\\u2019. In his further remarks, the state minister elaborated: \\u201cLast night, we successfully reached the staff-level agreement, a crucial step in securing the second tranche under our agreement with the IMF through the Extended Fund Facility. Prior to this achievement, a team from the International Monetary Fund conducted an extensive two-week review in Sri Lanka, engaging in detailed discussions on various topics. Given the complexity and scope of the discussions, it was not feasible to reach an agreement instantly. \\u201cSubsequently, we continued our deliberations during the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, held in Morocco. There, we engaged in in-depth discussions to clarify various aspects. Even then, we found it necessary to seek further clarifications on various matters, leading to continued discussions through online platform once we returned to Sri Lanka. The agreement, as it stands today, is the result of concerted efforts and dialogues involving officials from the International Monetary Fund, the Central Bank, and the Ministry of Finance. \\u201cDespite the favourable position Sri Lanka held with the International Monetary Fund in March 2023, subsequent disruptions and misinterpretations arose in recent weeks. State Minister Semasinghe emphasized, \\u201cWe categorically stated within and outside of Parliament that there is no reason to fear the approval of the executive committee or the release of the second instalment. As a government, we maintained our confidence.\\u201d Semasinghe underscored that the staff-level agreement, marking the completion of the first review of the program with the IMF, plays a pivotal role in facilitating the payment of arrears to multilateral creditors and expediting the process of debt restructuring. He reiterated that Sri Lanka is set to receive the second tranche of USD 330 million following the approval of the IMF\\u2019s Executive Board. Additionally, he has acknowledged the leadership and the guidance of President Ranil Wickremesinghe in these endeavours, as well as the contributions of officials, including the Governor of the Central Bank and the Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, in making these achievements possible, the PMD said. He noted that the staff-level agreement will enable the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and other multilateral financial institutions to make the remaining payments, further expediting debt restructuring efforts with international partners. The state minister expressed optimism that agreements related to debt restructuring may soon be finalized, aligning with the government\\u2019s objectives of reducing corruption and increasing transparency. He cited the IMF\\u2019s praise for Sri Lanka\\u2019s economic progress and noted that this reflects international confidence in the country\\u2019s economic prospects.\"\n",

Navishta Desilva, 36, had reportedly defrauded his employer of nearly AUD 250,000. He funnelled most of the money into events his personal company Global Talent Entertainment was organising featuring his cricket club Endeavour Hills and a star-studded line-up of international cricketers. There is no suggestion Endeavour Hills or the players were aware of any wrongdoing. Mr Desilva turned to fraud after sponsorship funding for the events fell through, the Victorian County Court heard on Friday. \\u201cIt seems to stem from immaturity and grandiose ideas,\\u201d Judge Brookes told the court. Dressed in a dark suit with open collar, Mr Desilva spoke softly as he pleaded guilty to one count of obtaining a financial advantage by deception. Over the course of 16 months between March 2021 and July 2022, Desilva arranged for 18 different purchase orders from Omnivision to CCTV master, a legitimate business which supplied his employer with surveillance cameras. By setting up a fake email address pretending to be from CCTV Master, Desilva was able to send fake invoices to Omnivision for inflated amounts which he funnelled into his own bank account. The fraud was noticed when an ex-colleague of Desilva\\u2019s audited the transactions he had been involved with after he left the company in July 2022. He has since repaid the money by working nights as a labourer in addition to a 9-5 job, and borrowing money from friends and family, defence barrister Sam Norton told the court. The court heard Mr Desilva had enjoyed a promising youth career as a cricketer, representing Sri Lanka at U-15 level and playing for the same club as legend of the game Kumar Sangakarra. When his dreams of a cricket career fell flat, he migrated to Australia at the age of 20, where he worked in a series of jobs including three years in auditing at Deloitte. Judge Brookes warned Mr Desilva he could be jailed for the \\u201cdevious and prolonged\\u201d offending. \\u201cThis is the sort of offence where ordinarily the community expects a period of jail,\\u201d Judge Brookes said, noting that Mr Desilva\\u2019s job at Deloitte would have given him the skills required to pull off the fraud. Toni Stokes, prosecuting, implored the judge to impose a prison term for the \\u201cvery serious offending\\u201d, noting that Mr Desilva had been convicted of a similar offence a decade earlier. Mr Desilva will return to court for sentencing on October 30. --Agencies\"\n",

Accordingly, the verdict will be delivered on November 17, as per a decision taken by Appeals Court President Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice Chamath Morais. A total of 176 specialist doctors had put forward petitions seeking that a court order be issued revoking the Cabinet decision taken in October 2022 to revise the retirement age of doctors. When the petitions were taken up for consideration today, the judge bench ordered the petitioners and the respondents to file their written submissions before the verdict was delivered. At the same time, the interim order, which suspended the inclusion of doctors and specialists in the gazette notification on the compulsory retirement of government sector employees at the age of 60, was extended until November 17. Last year, the Cabinet of Ministers announced the revision of the retirement age for doctors in October, stating that while doctors aged 60, 61 and 62 by the year\\u2019s end will be allowed to serve until 61, 62 and 63 respectively, those aged 59 will be required to retire by the age of 60.\"\n",

This order was issued by the two-member bench consisting of Appeals Court President Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice Chamath Morais when a writ petition filed by Pastor Jerome seeking an order preventing his arrest by the CID was taken up before the court today (20). The self-styled \\u201cprophet\\u201d, found himself in hot water after a video of a recent sermon delivered by him was widely circulated on social media, stirring much controversy in the country, due to allegations that it included derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures. Subsequently, President Ranil Wickremesinghe had ordered the CID to launch an immediate investigation into the matter, citing that such statements could create religious conflicts and harm the country\\u2019s harmony, while several other parties had also lodged complaints with the CID regarding the matter. However, Pastor Jerome flew out to Singapore two days before the Colombo Fort Magistrate\\u2019s Court issued a foreign travel ban on him. However, the police had said Pastor Fernando could be arrested upon his return to the island nation. On 26 May, Fernando had filed an FR petition before the court, through his attorneys, seeking an order preventing his arrest. The Inspector-General of Police (IGP), the DIG in charge of the CID, the CID director and the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the cybercrimes unit of the CID had been named as the respondents of the FR petition. In his petition, the Pastor deemed the CID\\u2019s attempts to arrest him unlawful, claiming that the police had not presented any piece of evidence to the court to prove that his comments threatened religious harmony in the country.\"\n",

      "    \"content\": \"U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres visited the Rafah border crossing on Friday and said aid trucks needed to move as quickly as possible from Egypt into the besieged Palestinian enclave of Gaza to alleviate a humanitarian crisis. The crossing has become a focus of attention since Israel began its mass bombing of Gaza in retaliation for a deadly assault by the Hamas militant group on southern Israel on Oct.7. Gaza is running short of fuel, food, water and medicine but the Egyptian-controlled border has remained shut while various parties wrangle over terms for allowing aid to flow in. Guterres flew to Egypt on Friday in a push to get the trucks moving. \\u201cThese trucks are not just trucks - they are a lifeline, they are the difference between life and death to many people in Gaza,\\u201d he said, speaking on the Egyptian side of the crossing. \\u201cTo see them stuck here makes me very clear - what we need is to make them move, to make them move to the other side of this wall to make them move as quickly as possible and as many as possible.\\u201d Gutteres, dressed in a dark suit under the desert sun, also called for a swift system of verification of the aid shipments. \\u201cWe are now actively engaging with all the parties, actively engaging with Egypt, with Israel, with the US, in order to make sure that we are able to clarify those conditions...in order to have as soon as possible these trucks moving to where they are needed,\\u201d he said. He was swarmed by Egyptian protesters chanting pro-Palestinian slogans as he spoke. In Geneva, the U.N. humanitarian office said it was in advanced talks with all parties in the Israel-Hamas conflict to ensure an aid operation can soon get underway in Gaza. Earlier, the United States had said details of a deal to send aid through the Rafah crossing were still being hammered out. Agreement had been reached for the passage of the first 20 trucks, it also said. This would still only be a fraction of what is required. Before the outbreak of conflict, about 450 aid trucks were arriving there daily. Most of Gaza\\u2019s 2.3 million people depend on humanitarian aid. The coastal enclave has been under a blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt since Hamas took control of it in 2007. In Geneva, Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said Gaza was in dire need of water, food, fuel and medical supplies. \\u201cWe are in deep and advanced negotiations with all relevant sides to ensure that an aid operation into Gaza starts as quickly as possible and with the right conditions,\\u201d he said. STAY OR EVACUATE? Rafah is the only crossing with Gaza for goods and people that does not border Israel. Efforts to get aid into Gaza have been complicated by the need to agree on a mechanism to inspect the aid, and a push to evacuate foreign passport holders from Gaza. Roads leading into Gaza are being repaired after being hit by bombardments in the past two weeks. A U.N. official said more than 200 trucks of aid were ready to move from Sinai to Gaza. During previous conflicts, aid had been delivered to Gaza during humanitarian pauses through the Kerem Shalom crossing, which is controlled by Israel. But Israel has said it will allow no aid to enter from its territory until Hamas releases the hostages it took during its Oct. 7 attack. It has said aid can enter through Egypt as long as it does not end up in the hands of Hamas. Egypt has said it will not accept any mass displacement of Gazans into Sinai, reflecting Arab fears that Palestinians could again flee or be forced from their homes en masse, as they were during the war surrounding Israel\\u2019s creation. Egypt is also concerned by security in northeastern Sinai, where it faced an Islamist insurgency that escalated a decade ago, and by the risk of any spillover from Hamas-controlled Gaza. \\nSource: Reuters\\n-Agencies\"\n",

In his further remarks, the state minister elaborated: \\u201cLast night, we successfully reached the staff-level agreement, a crucial step in securing the second tranche under our agreement with the IMF through the Extended Fund Facility. Prior to this achievement, a team from the International Monetary Fund conducted an extensive two-week review in Sri Lanka, engaging in detailed discussions on various topics. Given the complexity and scope of the discussions, it was not feasible to reach an agreement instantly. \\u201cSubsequently, we continued our deliberations during the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, held in Morocco.

Additionally, he has acknowledged the leadership and the guidance of President Ranil Wickremesinghe in these endeavours, as well as the contributions of officials, including the Governor of the Central Bank and the Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, in making these achievements possible, the PMD said. He noted that the staff-level agreement will enable the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and other multilateral financial institutions to make the remaining payments, further expediting debt restructuring efforts with international partners.

      "    \"content\": \"A man of Sri Lankan origins living in Australia has pleaded guilty to obtaining financial advantage by deception in a bid to put on T20 cricket tournaments featuring high-profile international players. Navishta Desilva, 36, had reportedly defrauded his employer of nearly AUD 250,000. He funnelled most of the money into events his personal company Global Talent Entertainment was organising featuring his cricket club Endeavour Hills and a star-studded line-up of international cricketers. There is no suggestion Endeavour Hills or the players were aware of any wrongdoing. Mr Desilva turned to fraud after sponsorship funding for the events fell through, the Victorian County Court heard on Friday. \\u201cIt seems to stem from immaturity and grandiose ideas,\\u201d Judge Brookes told the court. Dressed in a dark suit with open collar, Mr Desilva spoke softly as he pleaded guilty to one count of obtaining a financial advantage by deception. Over the course of 16 months between March 2021 and July 2022, Desilva arranged for 18 different purchase orders from Omnivision to CCTV master, a legitimate business which supplied his employer with surveillance cameras. By setting up a fake email address pretending to be from CCTV Master, Desilva was able to send fake invoices to Omnivision for inflated amounts which he funnelled into his own bank account. The fraud was noticed when an ex-colleague of Desilva\\u2019s audited the transactions he had been involved with after he left the company in July 2022. He has since repaid the money by working nights as a labourer in addition to a 9-5 job, and borrowing money from friends and family, defence barrister Sam Norton told the court. The court heard Mr Desilva had enjoyed a promising youth career as a cricketer, representing Sri Lanka at U-15 level and playing for the same club as legend of the game Kumar Sangakarra. When his dreams of a cricket career fell flat, he migrated to Australia at the age of 20, where he worked in a series of jobs including three years in auditing at Deloitte. Judge Brookes warned Mr Desilva he could be jailed for the \\u201cdevious and prolonged\\u201d offending. \\u201cThis is the sort of offence where ordinarily the community expects a period of jail,\\u201d Judge Brookes said, noting that Mr Desilva\\u2019s job at Deloitte would have given him the skills required to pull off the fraud. Toni Stokes, prosecuting, implored the judge to impose a prison term for the \\u201cvery serious offending\\u201d, noting that Mr Desilva had been convicted of a similar offence a decade earlier. Mr Desilva will return to court for sentencing on October 30. --Agencies\"\n",

The self-styled \\u201cprophet\\u201d, found himself in hot water after a video of a recent sermon delivered by him was widely circulated on social media, stirring much controversy in the country, due to allegations that it included derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures.

      "    \"content\": \"U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres visited the Rafah border crossing on Friday and said aid trucks needed to move as quickly as possible from Egypt into the besieged Palestinian enclave of Gaza to alleviate a humanitarian crisis. The crossing has become a focus of attention since Israel began its mass bombing of Gaza in retaliation for a deadly assault by the Hamas militant group on southern Israel on Oct.7. Gaza is running short of fuel, food, water and medicine but the Egyptian-controlled border has remained shut while various parties wrangle over terms for allowing aid to flow in. Guterres flew to Egypt on Friday in a push to get the trucks moving. \\u201cThese trucks are not just trucks - they are a lifeline, they are the difference between life and death to many people in Gaza,\\u201d he said, speaking on the Egyptian side of the crossing. \\u201cTo see them stuck here makes me very clear - what we need is to make them move, to make them move to the other side of this wall to make them move as quickly as possible and as many as possible.\\u201d Gutteres, dressed in a dark suit under the desert sun, also called for a swift system of verification of the aid shipments. \\u201cWe are now actively engaging with all the parties, actively engaging with Egypt, with Israel, with the US, in order to make sure that we are able to clarify those conditions...in order to have as soon as possible these trucks moving to where they are needed,\\u201d he said. He was swarmed by Egyptian protesters chanting pro-Palestinian slogans as he spoke. In Geneva, the U.N. humanitarian office said it was in advanced talks with all parties in the Israel-Hamas conflict to ensure an aid operation can soon get underway in Gaza. Earlier, the United States had said details of a deal to send aid through the Rafah crossing were still being hammered out. Agreement had been reached for the passage of the first 20 trucks, it also said. This would still only be a fraction of what is required. Before the outbreak of conflict, about 450 aid trucks were arriving there daily. Most of Gaza\\u2019s 2.3 million people depend on humanitarian aid. The coastal enclave has been under a blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt since Hamas took control of it in 2007. In Geneva, Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said Gaza was in dire need of water, food, fuel and medical supplies. \\u201cWe are in deep and advanced negotiations with all relevant sides to ensure that an aid operation into Gaza starts as quickly as possible and with the right conditions,\\u201d he said. STAY OR EVACUATE? Rafah is the only crossing with Gaza for goods and people that does not border Israel. Efforts to get aid into Gaza have been complicated by the need to agree on a mechanism to inspect the aid, and a push to evacuate foreign passport holders from Gaza. Roads leading into Gaza are being repaired after being hit by bombardments in the past two weeks. A U.N. official said more than 200 trucks of aid were ready to move from Sinai to Gaza. During previous conflicts, aid had been delivered to Gaza during humanitarian pauses through the Kerem Shalom crossing, which is controlled by Israel. But Israel has said it will allow no aid to enter from its territory until Hamas releases the hostages it took during its Oct. 7 attack. It has said aid can enter through Egypt as long as it does not end up in the hands of Hamas. Egypt has said it will not accept any mass displacement of Gazans into Sinai, reflecting Arab fears that Palestinians could again flee or be forced from their homes en masse, as they were during the war surrounding Israel\\u2019s creation. Egypt is also concerned by security in northeastern Sinai, where it faced an Islamist insurgency that escalated a decade ago, and by the risk of any spillover from Hamas-controlled Gaza. \\nSource: Reuters\\n-Agencies\"\n",
