Earlier this month (October), the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) issued a press release stating that a batch of IVIG imported to Sri Lanka from India in violation of the due procedure had been suspended from use.   With the suspension of the IVIG batch from use,   The Daily Morning   queried the Ministry as to whether there are sufficient stocks of the said drug to be administered to patients at hospitals. In response, the Ministry's Additional Secretary Dr. Saman Rathnayake said: ""There are two other companies that imported this drug. The suspended batch is a small quantity. By now, the supplies from the other two companies have arrived, and there are sufficient stocks.""   IVIG is a therapy treatment for patients with antibody deficiencies. It is prepared from a pool of immunoglobulins (antibodies) from the plasma of healthy donors. Immunoglobulins are made by the immune system of healthy people for the purpose of fighting infections.  The batch of IVIG in question had been suspended from use following the revelation that the local supplier named Isolez Biotech Pharma AG (Private) Limited had imported it by submitting forged documents for Customs clearing. It was also reported that the said local agent had imported a batch of the rituximab injection – which is administered to cancer patients – using a similar forged document. The NMRA stated last week that it had been revealed that the said local agent had imported a batch of the said drug, presenting a forged waiver of registration in the pretext of the same having been issued by the NMRA.

Speaking to   The Sunday Morning Business,   Petroleum Development Authority of Sri Lanka (PDASL) Chairman Saliya Wickramasuriya stated that the Ministry of Energy would be presenting the Cabinet paper for the granting of petroleum exploration licences in the Mannar, Cauvery, and Lanka Basins.   Elaborating further, he stated: “There has been significant interest. We have received Expressions of Interest (EOIs) in relation to around 150 offshore blocks in the Mannar and Cauvery Basins, from a total of around 890 blocks.”   He noted that the regulations setting out the legal framework under which interested entities may enter into joint study agreements with the PDASL in relation to the exploration of the country’s offshore assets had been published earlier this year.    Recent studies of well data and regional studies indicate that the three offshore sedimentary basins located around the island – Mannar, Cauvery, and Lanka – possess a proven working petroleum system with substantial deposits of natural gas.      The first natural gas discovery was made in the Mannar Basin off the northwestern coast in 2011. So far, exploratory drilling has made two discoveries from the same block with estimated reservoir capacities in excess of one trillion cubic feet (TCF) of natural gas and 10 million BBL (barrels) of condensate.    These discoveries propelled further explorations in the Mannar Basin, both in onshore and offshore regions.   A National Policy on Natural Gas was gazetted in September 2020, outlining domestic demand creation strategies and providing operators with options to commercialise offshore gas. A new Petroleum Resources Act No.21 of 2021 introduced independent regulation, policy, and operation functions and enhanced investor protection.

This is a positive indication that the Government intends to hold that Election. Free and fair elections being held when they are due is a core concept of a functioning democracy which was called into question earlier this year (2023) when the Local Government (LG) Elections were postponed. They were due in March, but were postponed on multiple occasions and now have been cancelled. There is no indication when they might be held. The Government justified its refusal to hold those Elections on the ground that the country was facing an economic crisis and that the money could be better spent elsewhere. The landmark Supreme Court (SC) judgment that the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress' decision to expel Minister Naseer Ahamad from the party membership is legally valid is an indication that the Court will rule against Government members when it concerns issues of justice.      The Government’s refusal to hold the LG Elections was challenged in the Court. The SC decided that the money already allocated in the budget for elections this year should not be blocked by the Government and needed to be released for the purpose of conducting those Elections. Instead of respecting this judicial ruling, Government Members threatened to summon the Judges who made the ruling to Parliament on the ground that the Judiciary could not decide on money matters that were the preserve of Parliament. They argued that the powers and privileges of Parliament had been violated by the order issued by the SC instructing the Finance Ministry Secretary to refrain from withholding funds for the polls. There was an outcry even internationally and the Government Members did not proceed with their dubious plan to summon the Judges before Parliament.      Due to the Government’s prioritisation of the economy over elections, there continues to be a question mark over prospects for elections. The economic crisis is in full swing, with further price increases in fuel costs taking place and electricity costs about to be hiked. The economy continues to shrink, though at a slower rate (3%) than before (11%). The Government’s failure to obtain the second tranche of International Monetary Fund (IMF) support is a warning regarding the precarious condition of the economy. The IMF has said that Sri Lanka’s economic recovery is still not assured. It has also said that the Government has not met the economic targets set for it, particularly with regard to reducing the budget deficit due to a potential shortfall in Government revenue generation. The IMF has said that the second tranche under its lending programme would only be released after it reaches a staff-level agreement, and there was no fixed timeline on when that would take place.      Parliamentary privilege    Unfortunately, the willingness of Government Members to challenge judicial decisions with regard to the electoral process is having its repercussions elsewhere. Parliamentarians have made use of Parliamentary privilege to openly criticise the Judiciary, including by naming them individually. The purpose of Parliamentary privilege is to enable elected representatives of the people to disclose the truth in the national interest. But this is a power that needs to be used with care and caution, especially if it is used to malign or insult individuals. Those who have the protection of Parliamentary privilege need to understand that it is very powerful, and that they should exercise the protection with restraint. It is the abuse of privilege that brings it into disrepute and undermines the wider perception of the central role that privilege plays.      The disrespectful conduct of some MPs has now reached a point where a Judge – who was deciding on controversial cases involving ethnic and religious conflict – has chosen to resign and even leave the country. Successive rulings made by the Judiciary in those cases appear to have been ignored by Government authorities. The judicial decisions and rulings made have been subjected to disparaging and insulting remarks in Parliament and outside. Mullaitivu District Judge T. Saravanarajah, who ruled on the controversial Kurunthurmalai (Kurundi Viharaya) case, resigned and fled Sri Lanka due to alleged threats and pressure. In a letter shared on social media, the Judge told the Judicial Services Commission that he was facing threats to his life. Such pressures placed on the Judiciary are clearly unacceptable in a democratic country, especially in situations where the Judiciary is being called on to defend the rights of the people who are being threatened by Government overreach.      At the present time, democratic freedoms and space for protest that exist in the country are being threatened by the Government’s efforts to silence public protest and criticism by means of the proposed Anti-Terrorist Act (ATA) and the Online Safety Act. The draft ATA gives the Government the power to arrest persons who are engaging in public protest or trade union action who can be charged for “intimidating the public or a section of the public”. The Online Safety Act seeks, among others, to “protect persons against damage caused by false statements or threatening, alarming, or distressing statements.” It will establish a five-member commission appointed by the President, which will be able to proscribe or suspend any social media account or online publication, and also recommend jail time for alleged offenses which can be highly subjective.       Elections again    The draft ATA has been opposed by Opposition political parties and by human rights organisations since it appeared about six months ago. The ATA was drafted as an improvement to the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act as amended, which had been highlighted by the European Union as objectionable on human rights grounds for the purposes of obtaining the Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus tax benefit for Sri Lankan exports. However, with the political and economic crisis in the country getting worse, it appears that the Government is determined to go ahead with this law.  Additionally, it has brought in the Online Safety Act as a surprise instrument to stymie the dissemination of information that people need regarding the non-transparent conduct of the Government.       The failure of the Government to fulfil many of the IMF’s transparency related requirements – such as posting its contracts and procurements on websites, and explaining its rationale for tax holidays and those who benefit – have contributed to the loss of confidence in the Government’s commitment to the economic reform process. There is a widespread belief that corruption is rampant and that the inability to get new foreign investment is partly due to this difficulty of doing business in Sri Lanka, quite apart from the leakage of Government revenues. There is no question that the Government needs to address these issues if it is to get the economy on the correct track and cushion the difficulties faced by the people in coping with their dire economic circumstances.      Despite the allocation of Rs. 11 billion for the Presidential Election in the provisional Budget for 2024, there remain questions regarding the Government’s plans for the future. United National Party Chairman Government MP Wajira Abeywardana has said that the Presidential Election may need to be postponed as it could undermine ongoing economic recovery measures. The provisional Budget for 2024 is Rs. 3,860 billion, of which Rs. 11 billion would seem to be a small fraction. However, the Budget for 2023 was Rs. 3,657 billion, and the Rs. 10 billion that was needed for the LG Elections was, likewise, only a small fraction of that Budget. But those Elections were not held and the Government argued that this money was better spent on development than on Elections. The issue of the postponement of elections due to the ongoing economic crisis may have to be faced once again when the Presidential Election is due. Elections need to be held whatever the economic cost, as they provide legitimacy to the elected arms of Government. The courts and the Judiciary need to be kept strong and respected just as much as the Executive and the Legislature, as they are parts of one whole.

These observations were made in an opinion piece on ""Ageing, gerontology: Geriatrics and Sri Lanka"" which was authored by Consultant Physician and Specialist in Internal Medicine attached to a private hospital, A. Balasuriya and published in the   Asian Journal of Internal Medicine  's Second Volume's Second Issue in August 2023.      Geriatrics    and Gerontology   Geriatrics or geriatric medicine is a medical specialty focused on providing care for the unique health related needs of the elderly. Gerontology is the study of the social, cultural, psychological, cognitive, and biological aspects of ageing.   “Ageing is not about decline, it's about growth, expansion, and the development of the full human potential,” says American gerontologist Kenneth M. Dychtwald.   Ageing is a universal phenomenon. No living being is exempted from ageing. Studying ageing communities has been in existence since the beginning of the 19th Century. There are various theories that explain ageing in different perspectives but the major views expressed are two-fold. The first theory suggests the wear and tear phenomenon, in which the building up of waste products that takes place over the years and the failure to clear up and repair that eventually leads to the gradual breakdown of the system that in turn results in cellular ageing (stochastic theories). The second view is based on our genetic memory and argues that our internal molecular clock is set to a particular timetable for each species. Support for this theory comes from animal studies where scientists have been able to cause an increased life span in some animals by altering just one gene.   As of now, there is no “cure” against ageing, and probably there will never be. Instead of struggling with getting older, we should endeavour to make the later years more enjoyable and productive. As stated by the French composer Daniel Francois Esprit Auber, “growing old is the only way to lead a long life”. As a country trying hard to qualify to be included in the “developed” category, Sri Lanka needs to plan for policies that will sustain our demographic trend in a favourable economic and social environment. We have already achieved longevity and the path to happy, healthy longevity remains an achievable goal with more focus and commitment from the policy makers and the health care professionals.   According to the statistics, Sri Lanka has a very fast ageing population and the elderly population (over the age of 60 years) in Sri Lanka in 2003 had a figure of 5.4% while this year, it has increased to 17%. It is estimated to be 27% in 2050. This rapid rise of the older population has direct implications on our existing health system and the socio-economic constitution of the country. A population with a longer lifespan is a success story of any health system in the world. Yet, it invariably translates into high dependency ratios, high disability figures and social poverty in a developing economy. Unless a country has planned well ahead of time to face this and celebrate this high longevity, the figures and statistics of older people in a community may not be a feature that can be celebrated for long.   The Sri Lankan Association of Geriatric Medicine was formed in 2011 and geriatric medicine was incorporated to the postgraduate curriculum in 2013 by the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine.    Geriatrics focuses on the health of the ageing body, and gerontology is the science, or the study of the physical, mental and social aspects of ageing. Geriatrics is actually a subset of gerontology since gerontology takes a broader perspective.   Gerontology was first attributed to Ukrainian Nobel Physiology or Medicine Prize Laureate, Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov who first used it in 1903. Geriatrics was introduced in 1909, by Austrian-American physician Ignatz Leo Nascher to describe the medical care of elderly patients. At that time, the population of older adults was growing, and physicians began to recognise that older patients often had unique health care related needs that required specialised knowledge and training. Over time, the field of geriatrics developed as a distinct area of study, encompassing a wide range of topics related to ageing and the health of older adults.   Gerontology is essentially a multi-disciplinary science that integrates several study areas. This specialty combines a staff working together that includes doctors, nurses, behavioural and social scientists, social workers, biologists, economists, psychologists, those who study the humanities and the arts, policy experts, and many other scholars and researchers. Gerontology includes investigation into changes in the society that come from the ageing process, studying the mental, physical, and social changes of individuals as they age and the application of this knowledge to programmes and policies dealing with older communities.   The demographic profile of Sri Lanka is fast changing. Scrutiny into our economic stability, inflation rates, and per capita income projections shows that our poverty rates will not be declining for the next few decades. This will severely impact the socially deprived communities like older people, especially more vulnerable groups like elders without social protection schemes or a fixed pension based income. As such, though our population dynamics show staggeringly high figures of older people, the question is whether they will be disability free with the added years to life. Will they have good quality silver years or are we just adding years to their lives with more disability and poverty? The medical field in the country has recognised geriatrics as a medical specialty and a few universities have included it in the final year medical school curricula. However, apart from recognising the diseases and disabilities of older age, the country’s responsiveness to sufficiently handle the demographic change is questionable.      Goal setting and planning   Ageing does not start when one is at 60 years of age or 70 years of age. The current view is that it starts during the time of conception. As such, planning for old age on a personal basis as well as planning for its ageing population from a country based perspective, has to be done fairly early. The modern day life needs proper goal setting and planning in order to prevent the wastage of money from a population point of view as well as to improve the quality of life from a personal standpoint.   Planning for an ageing population is important for any country so as to ensure that the needs of older adults are met, so that they can age with dignity.   We need to develop policies that support healthy ageing. These can help older adults stay active, engaged, and independent. This can include initiatives to promote healthy lifestyles, provide access to health care, and ensure that older adults have access to community resources and services. It is true that we have a Directorate in the Ministry of Health to cover the needs of older people, but, the concept of healthy ageing needs to be much more robust with country-wide dissemination, and in this regard, the media plays a major role.   From a country based perspective, if we look at the lifestyle of an average middle aged Sri Lankan man or woman, how many are overweight? How many suffer from diabetes, hypertension and other non-communicable diseases? The disease burden, hospital and medication costs, and the loss of the workforce power of caregivers, all add to the already frail economy of the country in a dramatic manner. The focus on healthy ageing from a gerontological perspective is vital for the next few decades as we move forward with the exponentially expanding ageing population.   From an individual perspective, how many people think that exercise is important for life and really engage in physical activity? How many people are prepared to plan for their old age at 30 years or 40 years of age? How many have a rough plan of how they are going to spend their life when they are 70 years and above? How many have income security at old age?   Old age does not happen overnight and hence, early preparation and planning for a stress, poverty and disability free old age is vital to a low income country like Sri Lanka.   The answers to these questions need input from both health care providers and sociologists. In short, these issues need the full focus if they are to make old age self sufficient from health and economy based perspectives.   Furthermore, due to the current economic crisis, we do witness a large number of young people migrating looking for greener pastures. Though they do bring along foreign revenue to the country, the elderly parents are often neglected and are helpless and vulnerable due to economic insecurity, poverty and the lack of caregivers. We are moving away from large families to nuclear families and family based social support is becoming a rarity.   As we boast of longevity in Sri Lanka, we also need to invest in infrastructure that supports older adults which includes accessible transportation, age friendly housing, and community facilities that support social and recreational activities. We also need more regularised caregiver training programmes apart from the few ad-hoc ones that we currently have. Thereby, we can get employment opportunities to the young while benefiting the older community. These investments can help older adults remain independent and connected to their communities.   Despite our economic constraints and poverty, we need to at least plan for the provision of financial security in old age. Many older adults rely on fixed incomes, such as social security or pensions, to meet their basic needs. Providing financial security through policies such as social security and retirement savings programmes can help ensure that older adults have the resources that they need in order to live with dignity.      Ageism   The other important issue is addressing ageism. Ageism, as described by the World Health Organisation, refers to stereotypes (how we think), prejudices (how we feel) and discrimination (how we act) towards others or oneself based on age, and such can be a barrier to healthy ageing. Addressing ageism through education, awareness campaigns, and policies that promote age friendly environments can help ensure that older adults are treated with respect and dignity. Certain measures are already taken to give priority to old people at Government hospitals and certain institutions. However, the concept is not fully functional and it is saddening to note that if we visit a Government hospital, we can still witness many old and in fact very old people who come to obtain health services without a caregiver, staying in long queues for long hours, and not being considered for any priority care.   Sri Lanka has now taken steps to include geriatrics in the medical school curriculum and introduced postgraduate training in geriatrics as a specialised field which is a very timely and wise approach. In a couple of years, we would be having our first qualified geriatricians in the country.   There are a few gerontology courses that are being conducted in Sri Lanka. The National Institute of Social Development offers a Diploma in Gerontology, a one year programme that provides training in geriatric care for healthcare professionals and caregivers. The Institute of Gerontology of the University of Colombo, offers a range of short courses and workshops in geriatric care for healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, and caregivers. However, while there are around eight medical faculties, only the University of Sri Jayewardenepura conducts a postgraduate master’s programme in gerontology. It would be appropriate for other universities to commence graduate and postgraduate programmes in gerontology and to link such with geriatric postgraduate education so that these professionals can work efficiently and bring about a visible and tangible, productive change to our ageing population.   With regard to research collaborations, geriatrics and gerontology researchers can collaborate on studies that investigate the health and well-being of ageing communities. This can lead to a better understanding of the needs of ageing communities and inform the development of interventions and policies.   Concerning community partnerships, geriatrics and gerontology professionals can partner with community organisations and groups to provide outreach, education, and support to ageing communities. This can include programmes and services that address social isolation, housing, transportation, and other issues that impact the well-being of ageing communities.   On the aspect of advocacy and policy development, geriatrics and gerontology professionals can work in close liaison to advocate for policies and programmes that support the needs of ageing communities. This can include initiatives to improve health care access, affordability, and the quality of care, as well as policies that address social determinants of health.   Collaborations between geriatrics and gerontology can lead to better outcomes for ageing communities by providing comprehensive and personalised care, advancing research and knowledge, and promoting advocacy and policy development for the improved quality of life for the silver aged population in Sri Lanka.

In hindsight, two key factors helped some organisations to perform better through this challenging period.    The first was the availability of data and information across the supply chain. Organisations that integrated data visibility better across their supply chain were able to tackle the unprecedented changes and come out on the other side.   The second factor was how integrated the supply chain was overall. Organisations with fragmented supply chain operations found it difficult to create the required level of integration for a seamless operation.    As a result of the challenges faced, organisations are investing in harnessing real-time data and information to enable faster decision-making.    Some of the lessons learned, especially in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry, which runs on reasonably stable plans, is how to think differently and become more agile, and how to respond to change faster. If we took one month to respond to change previously, now we need to respond within a week, or at times even within a day.    Even though scenario planning was always talked about, very few companies had put it into practice. At Hemas Consumer Brands, we have now made it the norm to have two to three scenario plans depending on which scenario comes to life.    The importance of data was underscored over the years and more so since supply chains were considerably dependent on people prior to the pandemic. Given that people had difficulty reaching workplaces throughout the pandemic and economic crisis, it became more important to have a common database which would allow faster decision-making.    The pandemic taught us how to make decisions faster, which required making information and data available, so that there is less dependence on employees’ physical presence.   Digitalisation is playing a starring role in upgrading value chains. Making data visible across teams and digital transformation of the supply chain is an ongoing endeavour. Dashboards can be created to provide visibility for data and information and democratised data for a wider pool of employees, so that it is not only accessible to a few. Open sharing of data and information enables teams to make better decisions for the benefit of the organisation.    Globally it was observed that only 30% of digitisation gives you Return on Investment (ROI). Yes, there are times it does not give an ROI immediately. But if you look into the future, in terms of how supply chains will be operating in another 10-15 years, if you don’t make these investments today and gear your people, systems, and processes to be more data-driven and more digitally driven, you will be at a competitive disadvantage at that point in time.   Needless to say, geopolitics played a critical role in upsetting the supply chain apple cart. Every country depends on supplies from different markets and supply sources, and with Sri Lanka being a small country with limited resources, manufacturing organisations in the FMCG space depend heavily on global supply chain networks.    The Russia-Ukraine war impacted supply chains globally. I believe more than 90% of the time these factors are outside of our control, but from the perspective of supply chain professionals, what is important is to move from merely responding to these changes to creating the ability to predict the future – what the impact to our supply chain is going to be from geopolitical issues. At present, we are likely to head into another unanticipated impact with the unfolding situation in Gaza.   Over the last 12 months, one of the things that we have done is build a set of capable people to drive digitalisation. We have invested heavily in people, building a strong team into our supply chain to enable us to take forward our journey in building strong and resilient supply chains. Many organisations have understood the importance of prioritisation and in addition to investing in the people, have created the right prioritisation.   Some of the key skills of supply chain leaders are to understand the total value chain. You should be able to map your value chain from your supplier to customer in your head, including the integration points and the interdependencies.   As a supply chain leader, you should be able to communicate with stakeholders, including external and internal stakeholders, to ensure expectations are aligned and manageable. You will need to communicate effectively with your sales, marketing, manufacturing, and finance teams, who will have different expectations from your supply chain. This is extremely important. Finally, how you manage and engage your people is key to a successful supply chain.   Greening your value chain has become imperative and organisations are working on a very strong programme in environmental sustainability by collecting as much non-biodegradable plastic waste to offset and recycle plastics used in the value chain. Different work streams working within the supply chain as well as outside can reduce the amount of plastics used in the manufacturing process.    From a sustainability perspective, our biggest achievement has been to create this mindset across the organisation of the importance of sustainability, because it is not something that one or two people in the organisation can drive. It is something that everyone in all departments, including the supply chain, needs to rally behind and think of sustainable solutions in day-to-day operations.

Two key factors that helped organizations perform better during this challenging period were the availability of data and information across the supply chain, and the overall integration of the supply chain. Organisations are investing in harnessing real-time data and information to enable faster decision-making, especially in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry.

The pandemic taught us how to make decisions faster by making information and data available, reducing dependence on employees' physical presence. Digitalisation is playing a starring role in upgrading value chains, making data visible across teams and digital transformation of the supply chain. Dashboards can provide visibility for data and information, and open sharing enables teams to make better decisions for the benefit of the organization."

Clearly, this proposed Bill is meant to create offences under contempt of court and therefore, the purpose is to create criminal offences.   In creating criminal offences, there are set legal processes and legal provisions binding in all instances where offences are created and also when the offences are investigated, prosecuted and adjudicated. Once an offence is created, the ordinary course of law that prevails in the country takes over and these processes should be followed. That is the very meaning of equality before the law and this provision is recognised by Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Thus, a person accused and dealt with under the law for contempt of court should be treated first as a suspect, then as an accused and finally convicted as a convicted person, all within the general framework of the law that prevails within the country.   Besides, equality before the law as recognised under Article 12(1), is also based on the very notion of the rule of law. In a succinct definition of the rule of law, former Lord Chief Justice (CJ) of England and Wales, Tom Bingham has summed up this notion as follows: “all persons and authorities within the State, whether public or private, should be bound by and entitled to the benefit of laws publicly and prospectively promulgated and publicly administered in the courts”. Thus, all the obligations and entitlements of everybody emanate from the same principles which are equally applied to all.    From this, it follows that like any other criminal offence, contempt of court as an offence should have a clear definition. As can be demonstrated from every offence in the Penal Code and other offences created under other statutes, there is always a clear definition which gives the boundaries within the scope of which the crime is understood and also prosecuted and adjudicated.    The definition of the crime sets the limits for the investigations into any complaints relating to the commission of such a crime to compare the evidence available and to assess whether the requirements of the definition have been met by the kind of evidence that is available. Thus, the investigators into the crime are strictly bound to conduct their operations within the framework of the definition of the crime. This first of all implies that there is a definition of the crime.   The task of the Attorney General in particular is to examine the available evidence and to assess whether there is a likelihood of conducting a successful prosecution in order to prove the elements of the crime as enshrined in the definition of the crime. If no such definition exists, the prosecutor has no jurisdiction to go into the matter at all.    The same is true about courts and judges. A trial judge when conducting a trial on a crime will strictly confine himself/herself to the legal limits within the definition of the crime. All other matters will be excluded from all trial proceedings. The presiding judge will ensure that nothing outside the scope of the definition of the crime being tried will be brought into the proceedings. And, in doing so, he/she will also be bound by the laws relating to the Criminal Procedure and also the Evidence Ordinance. All such trials are only possible when a definition of crime is available.    The defence of the accused is also confined within the framework of the definition of the crime. The accused may take up the position that if there is no definition of the crime, that he/she is unable to answer the charges. His/her duty in offering a defence is determined by the legal definition of the crime on which he/she is charged. He/she has a right to know the charge and its legal definitions, and he/she has the right to get the assistance of lawyers, in order to have such definitions and all legal matters explained to him/her and also articulate his/her own position in terms of this legal framework. Where a definition clearly exists, the accused can prove his/her position by challenging any of the important aspects of the elements of the crime. If he/she successfully challenges any of these aspects, he/she would be discharged of any criminal liability. Even if he/she were to be convicted mistakenly, he/she would have a right to appeal and in the appeal, he/she could take up matters about the definition of the crime under which he/she is charged and as to whether the prosecution has discharged its duties of proving all the essential elements of the crime against him/her through legally valid evidence. If any of this fails, he/she has the right to be discharged.    All these matters are important because in the draft Contempt of Court Bill, there is no clear definition or in fact any definition at all of what is called the ‘crime’ of contempt of court. Therefore, as this particular statute is meant entirely to be a criminal statute, it fails to be such a statute at all. The mere passing of a statute by whatever majority cannot create a criminal offence for as long as the criminal offence has not been statutorily defined. Therefore, voting on a Bill that is supposed to create a criminal offence, which has failed to do so, is a futile exercise. Thus, proceeding with this Bill as it is now will not serve any legally valid purpose because the offence that it is trying to create is not defined by law.   The danger of passing such a statute is that it could be made use for any purpose at all and there would be no predictability about the limits and the manner in which such a law can be misused.    It should be noted that misuse is possible as all persons are human and therefore are susceptible to committing errors inadvertently or even wilfully. The persons engaged in the administration of justice despite all their good intentions and qualifications could still commit errors.    There are instances in which such things have happened relating to contempt of court which has already come under disapproval of the United Nations Human Rights Committee (UNHRC) when examining two cases submitted by Sri Lankan citizens to this Committee under the provisions of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). These cases are the case of Tony Michael Anthony Fernando (1189/2003) and the case of S.B. Dissanayake (E-3585/04 EN). Particularly in the case of Fernando, the alleged offence was that he talked loudly in court. It would be quite strange if talking loudly in court becomes a part of a definition of the crime of contempt of court. As recorded by the UNHRC, what really happened was that Fernando took an objection to the then CJ presiding over a case in which Fernando was the complainant. Despite the objection, the CJ presided over the very bench and asked Fernando the basis on which he is making this objection, i.e. objection to the hearing of the case by the CJ. Fernando read from the Constitutional Article 12(1) and said that that is the basis on which he is making the submission. The CJ immediately asked him to stop speaking, threatening that if he were to speak a word more, he would have one month more to each of those words for the sentence that he has in mind which was one year of rigourous imprisonment (RI). And Fernando was taken from the Court to the prison immediately and spent the full sentence. It was this case that was disapproved of by the UNHRC in a written view expressed under the special procedure recognised under the Optional Protocol to the ICCPR. Similarly, Dissanayake was sentenced for two years of RI for using some derogatory words against the court. In neither of these occasions did the accused have the benefit of being charged under a well defined offence with the description of the possible consequences.    The question of the definition also arises due to some other provisions of the proposed Bill such as Sections 8(1)(b) and 8(1)(c). These subsections allow a motion to be filed by the Attorney General (AG) or any other person about the commission of an offence under the Act in the courts. There is no provision within the Act explaining what is the process by which the AG should get involved in matters relating to contempt of court. What is the process by which the AG receives information, processes information and also assesses the legal basis of such information as well as the legal implications of this information? In the absence of a definition of an offence, all the considerations by the AG would be purely of a subjective nature. The AG thus becomes an officer having to exercise the power about an undefined matter. This, in any case, makes it impossible to perform in a legally valid manner. Therefore, the whole process of illegal definitions, and other matters which are arising out of the general law of the country and the new process of the law, should all be taken into consideration in trying to define the role of the AG in terms of prosecutions on the contempt of court offence. In all other crimes, the AG is not an initiator of the legal proceedings. There is a whole process which proceeds by way of investigations and the gathering and assessment of evidence before the AG comes into the picture and these are the responsibilities of other departments and officers.   Besides being legally absurd and vague, these provisions of the Act also leave room for abuse. There had been cases when the work of the AG’s Department has been criticised by lawyers appearing in cases, for example, when they point out that the information provided by the AG’s Department’s representative to the court is false or incorrect, but the AG’s Department has moved that such criticisms amount to contempt of court and therefore the lawyers should be prosecuted for contempt of court. In one instance, such an application was recorded by the court and was referred to the CJ for his consideration on whether to take action against the lawyer. This shows the tendency to extend the contempt of court idea not only to courts but also Departments such as the AG’s Department.    Also, the Act states that any other person can also bring up a matter by way of a motion. This practice of any other person bringing in a petition has been a practice which has come to the notice of even courts as a possible abusive practice. In the famous case of Nathasha Edirisooriya, the case relating to the use of the ICCPR Act came to be condemned in a highly appreciated judgement by a High Court Judge who noted that a mere petition by whoever a prominent person, even a famous monk, by itself should not lead to the beginning of legal proceedings, implying that without satisfying the requirements of the law relating to criminal offence, actions should not be taken. It applies even more to serious issues such as contempt of court which unscrupulous persons could abuse the same.    Thus, all these matters require clear legal articulation if the proposed law is not to create opportunities for all sorts of abuses rather than for the protection of proper and peaceful proceedings of cases in individual instances which is the core element of the contempt of court jurisdiction.

Addressing an election rally in Kegalle, Fernando said that some seemed to have been impressed by the massive numbers of participants at JVP rallies. “The JVP has 70,000 members who are taken from one rally to another to be able to show numbers to impress others. It is not a new phenomenon. They have been doing so for years. But when it comes to the final count of votes, their trick will be exposed. Regardless of whether they win or lose, they have a mechanism to bring people to their rallies. The JVP has created a Facebook wave to show that they are going to win the forthcoming local polls. Even in the last elections, the JVP could only garner 42,000 votes. The maximum number of votes they could get is 120,000 to 130,000 votes from all over the country. They would not be able to come into power with those numbers.   “Even if they win the election, they are incapable of governing a country because they do not know how to do go about it and they do not have the capacity to do so. Anura Kumara Dissanayake would not be able to work with the international community to get the necessary assistance to steer the country out of the present crisis. He would not be able to secure the support of the international community to bring fuel. He does not have international connections. Basil Rajapaksa got $ 4.5 billion from India. We imported fuel with that money. Anura cannot do that. He cannot even speak to Indian fishermen to obtain a litre of petrol from them. We challenge the JVP to name who would be the Ministers of Finance and Foreign Affairs under a government run by them. They do not have people with the capacity to hold such positions.   “The JVP has always been duping the people. During the time of Sirimavo Bandaranaike in 1971 they got around 12,000 youths killed, and in the 1987-88 period, another 60,000 youths met the same fate. Those who were born after 2000 do not know the real conduct of the JVP.      “One of my supporters told me that his family members attended a recent JVP rally in Kurunegala. Some JVP supporters told them that last time, when the houses were set on fire, the houses of only those who had supported the Government were destroyed, and if they would not attend the rally they would be labelled as Government supporters and their property and houses would be in danger, the next time such an incident occurs. So they attended the rally. This indicates that some people attend these rallies out of fear.   “JVP trade unionists take money from industrialists and company owners, threatening them that their unions would strike if the money is not given to them. They extort money from the business community. This they do without the governing power. Imagine what they would do if they come into power?” Fernando queried.

The FR that were violated by the “inactions and omissions” on the part of Jayawardena, Fernando, Mendis, Jayasundara, and Sirisena (“lax in affording the protection and guarantees enjoined under the Constitution and other laws, and has breached the duty to protect”) included the right to equality before the law and equal protection of the law and the freedom to manifest one’s religion or belief.    Accordingly, Sirisena has been ordered to pay a sum of Rs. 100 million, Jayasundara and Jayawardena have been ordered to pay Rs. 75 million each, Fernando has been ordered to pay Rs. 50 million, and Mendis has been ordered to pay Rs. 10 million in compensation out of their personal funds. The State has also been ordered to pay Rs. 1 million in compensation to the victims.   The SC further ordered that a victims’ fund be established at the Office for Reparations, which should formulate a scheme to award the said sums ordered as compensation in a fair and equitable manner to the victims and their families. The aforesaid parties including Sirisena have been ordered to make their payment of compensation to the said fund, while the said Office has been ordered to submit a progress report on the relevant payments to the SC within six months.    Furthermore, the SC has ordered the said Office to investigate the alleged underpayment and non-payment of compensation to the victims of the terror attacks and their families, as per a decision taken by the then Cabinet of Ministers.   The Office has also been directed to invite any generous benefactors and donors to contribute towards the victims’ fund, by way of notification through the media.   Meanwhile, the SC has also ordered that the State take appropriate disciplinary action against Jayawardena for his lapses and failures as the SIS Director at the time of the terror attacks. This order has been issued in a backdrop where he has been appointed as the SDIG – Administration following the retirement of SDIG Nandana Munasinghe, and IGP Chandana D. Wickramaratne has reportedly made a recommendation to the National Police Commission (NPC) to make Jayawardena's appointment permanent.   By putting the lives and liberty of common citizens at risk, the SC observed, while commenting on the State liability for the infringements of fundamental human rights, that the respondents have caused the possible collapse of public order and the rule of law, and added that it entailed the potential to destroy the faith of the citizens in its State and to erode its legitimacy. The judgement issued by the SC read that large scale destruction, disruption, and consequential violence can threaten a country’s social fabric, endanger national unity, and destroy prospects for economic growth and development.    “If there is a failure of public order, it is because of the inadequacies of the branches of government and we need to address them holistically. A human being cries out for justice when they feel that the insensible act has crucified their personal liberty and family. That warrants the grant of compensation under the public law remedy against the State as well. It follows then that a claim in public law for compensation for the contravention of human rights and fundamental freedoms, the protection of which is guaranteed in the Constitution, is an acknowledged remedy for the enforcement and protection of such rights.”    In the circumstances, the SC held that the State is liable to compensate the victims for the incalculable harm and damage that have been caused to both people and property.   The judgement also read: “We must express our shock and dismay at the deplorable want of oversight and inaction that we have seen in the conduct of affairs pertaining to security, law and order and intelligence. There are glaring examples of a lack of strategic co-ordination, expertise and preparedness that need a critical examination as to the way forward.    “The failures that eventuated in the terror attacks and the concomitant deaths and devastations have left behind an indelible blot on the security apparatus and this country which is blessed by a multi-cultural and multi-religious polity cannot be left to the vagaries of these follies and made to suffer, leading to violence, fear, apprehension and uncertainty. These events must remind us starkly of the necessity to effect legislative, structural and administrative changes.”   It further stated that it is evident that there is an urgent need to place the National Security Council (NSC) on a statutory footing and its composition specified with clarity so that there are no manoeuvres to manipulate hostile exclusions and selective inclusions. Stating that there is a necessity to revamp the security systems and intelligence structures, the SC added that the expanding threats of terrorism and emerging challenges could be nipped in the bud by doing so.   “The course of conduct we have scrutinised demonstrates a woeful lack of expertise in intelligence gathering and dissemination among important individuals entrusted with the task. For instance, the offices of the SIS Director and the Chief of National Intelligence must be occupied by individuals with the necessary skill and expertise. The conduct of the respondents who held the said offices, upon receiving sensitive intelligence information, shows a lack of awareness and understanding of strategic vision. We recommend that the duties and functions of the office of the Chief of National Intelligence must be stipulated with definite certainty and that the office should be occupied by a person having the necessary expertise, training and qualification,” the judgement further read.   A total of 12 FR petitions had been filed by Janath S. Vidanage; Attorney Nagananda Kodithuwakku; Saman Nandana Sirimanne; Jude Dinuke Laknath Perera, Christine Bianca Shivanthi Perera, Mathes Hewage Nimal Karunasiri, and Lincoln Ramkumar Ramiah; P.K.A.D.

When contacted by   The Morning  , Sirisena's Personal Secretary, Sameera de Silva said that the former's attorneys may hold a media briefing today (12) to express their views regarding the verdict given by the SC.   Attempts to contact NPC Chairman Chandra Fernando and Police Media Spokesman, Senior Superintendent of Police and Attorney Nihal Thalduwa to query about the course of action which will be taken regarding the order issued by the SC to initiate disciplinary action against Jayawardena, proved futile. Previously, the NPC told   The Morning   that any pending disciplinary inquiry or action against a Police officer would result in the NPC deciding against such confirmation of any appointment or promotion concerning the officer in question.    On 21 April 2019, Easter Sunday, three churches (the St. Sebastian’s Church in Katuwapitiya, the St. Anthony’s Church in Kochchikade, and the Zion Church in Batticaloa) and three luxury hotels in Colombo (the Cinnamon Grand Colombo, The Kingsbury Colombo, and the Shangri-La Colombo) were targeted in a series of co-ordinated suicide bombings. Later that day, another two bomb explosions took place at a house in Dematagoda and the Tropical Inn Lodge in Dehiwala. A total of 269 people excluding the bombers were killed in the bombings, including about 45 foreign nationals, while at least 500 were injured.   Following the attack, Sirisena, who was the President at that time, appointed a Presidential Commission of Inquiry (CoI) to investigate the terror attacks. Sirisena, Fernando, Jayasundara, Jayawardena, Mendis, and many other politicians, public servants, Catholic clergy, and victims of the terror attacks testified before the CoI. In its final report, which was prepared after recording evidence from 457 individuals, the CoI had recommended to the Attorney General to institute criminal proceedings against Sirisena, Fernando, Jayasundara, Jayawardena, and Mendis under the appropriate provisions of the Penal Code.

Speaking to   The Sunday Morning Business,   Ministry of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation Secretary K.D.S. Ruwanchandra stated that the ministry’s hands were tied and that it had no option but to rescind the 2017 regulations published in Extraordinary Gazette No. 2041/10 of 17 October 2017 as a consequence of the recent decision made by the Supreme Court in the Special Determination on the bill titled Licensing of Shipping Agents, Freight Forwarders, Non-Vessel Operating Common Carriers, and Container Operators (Amendment) Bill.   “The Supreme Court decided that the Minister has no authority to issue gazettes regarding licences and charges,” he stated.   However, these assertions were vehemently denied by Sri Lanka Shippers’ Council Chairman Russell Juriansz who, speaking to   The Sunday Morning Business  , stated that in terms of the Supreme Court decision, the Minister had no power to make regulations to declare the charges to be levied in the shipping trade and that it had no relevance to the Extraordinary Gazette No. 2041/10.    “The Minister published a gazette on 22 October 2022 (Gazette No. 2302/24), where he said that the delivery order charge should be Rs. 20,000 and introduced a cost recovery charge of $ 8 per cubic metre. However, he later realised that he did not have the authority to issue this gazette.    “Therefore, he introduced another gazette to amend the Licensing of Shipping Agents, Freight Forwarders, Non-Vessel Operating Common Carriers and Container Operators Act No. 10 of 1972 to grant him the necessary powers to introduce the above-mentioned charges. It was this amendment of the 1972 Act that was challenged before the Supreme Court.    “According to the Supreme Court judgement which was read in the Parliament, the Minister has no authority to decide on the prices in the trade. Therefore, he had to rescind the gazette published on 22 October 2022,” Juriansz stated.   Juriansz pointed out that the Minister had been required to rescind only the Extraordinary Gazette No. 2302/24 of 20 October 2022 in terms of the Supreme Court decision. Instead, the Minister had, under the guise of rescinding the Extraordinary Gazette No. 2302/24, also rescinded the Extraordinary Gazette No. 2041/10 of 17 October 2017, which contained the 2017 regulations.       The 2017 regulations provided that the cost of carriage of containers from origin to destination must be identified as all-inclusive freight without dividing them into land costs and freight components.    Therefore, service providers can only recover costs incurred from the use of the service from those to whom the service was provided and not from a third party with no such contractual liability. The only additional charge recognised under the 2017 regulations was the Delivery Order (DO) fee.   Juriansz pointed out that prior to the 2017 regulations, shipping lines had more than 40 different line items which were levied from importers.    He further stated that following the recent rescinding of the 2017 regulations, shipping lines had already informed their customers that a component called a Terminal Handling Charge would be payable locally. He cautioned that these additional charges could have a significant impact on the cost of living in the country.

But not all children are fortunate to have those benefits at the preschool level due to various social and economic disadvantages.   Some areas in Sri Lanka are more impacted than others – one such is Mannar, still reeling from the aftermath of the war and now having to deal with the post-effects of the pandemic and the economic crisis. The most affected are the children but they are also the most resilient and that’s what Chavez Selvaratnam discovered when he first visited Mannar.   Chavez was born and lived all his life in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The regular visits to Sri Lanka to visit family, however, opened his eyes to much more than the natural beauty of the country. He felt he needed to do something meaningful, which led him to leave his lucrative career as a racehorse trainer and come to Sri Lanka.   He then founded Hüsk, a platform for social reform, animal welfare, clean water, and environmental action and the Little Trees Nurtury – a preschool in Mannar that works with the community, for the community, to build the community.   Chavez was on Kaleidoscope this week, sharing the reasons he picked Mannar, and his thoughts behind Little Trees Nurtury.         Following are excerpts:         What did you see in Mannar that made you start this preschool project?       I went to Mannar in 2020 and met Bridging Lanka’s Founder Jeremy Liyanage, who also has the Donkey Clinic. I was taken aback by what I saw in Mannar. The level of poverty was terrible. It was clear to me; something needed to be done to help this community from the bottom up. My vision was to build a preschool and help them right from the bottom.So why a preschool?       A preschool is the best way of uniting children. Children are fresh; they are young minds in this world, and in a community that has been through so much, it is important to unite the children, which will lead to uniting different communities, different religions, and racial backgrounds. Also, preschools can teach children to have more imagination to get more light in their lives. It’s very hard to get that in a society that’s as stagnant as that of Mannar Island.When you first saw the community, what struck you the most?      Unproductivity. There is a lack of everything. When we visited during the lockdown, people were just standing around, hungry, not knowing what to do with their lives to be useful and productive. It was really scary and disturbing to see people not knowing what to do with themselves – that’s what hit us; we had to do something.   Mannar has been widely forgotten even though it was troubled during the war and doesn’t get the assistance or the awareness it should, to uplift its people.         Mannar has one of the most diverse communities in Sri Lanka. How do you think a simple preschool will prompt that diversity into unity?      Bridging Lanka’s Donkey Clinic is in Olaithoduwai, which is at a crossroads of Islamic, Christian, and Hindu villages. There was an opportunity for us to bring children from different communities to a central point.   Initially, we had a discussion with religious leaders seeking their approval. Our first step was the local mosque, where the Imam was so happy that someone was taking an interest in the area. They affirmed that children were most important for the future. This is where the roots were planted.The people in Mannar are farmers and fishermen, the backbone of our country. If we don’t give these people a future, we will all be impacted negatively and we won’t be as well off as we think. So it is important to empower the children to think differently, to be proud and say, “My father fishes every single morning; he goes to get food for us so we can eat”. They have to feel empowered by that.   Uniting people based on what they are and what they do together as a community is a beautiful thing. The world needs more of that. The design of the preschool is unique; it tells a story. What is different and how does it engage the children?       Lakmi Fernando, who is the architect, had an amazing vision for this building. She deconstructed the Mannar Fort and added a very playful approach to the concept, seeing it through a child’s eye.   It’s a very simple, earthy building, constructed so children see everything at their level. There are spaces for imagination and for play. The theme is “playfulness”, to encourage playfulness in children. I think that feelings of happiness and joy should be integral to all preschools.         How is the preschool being funded?      We began a fundraiser on an online platform called chuffed.org, a crowdfunding platform for socially-conscious projects. We reached our initial goal of $ 60,000 but with the increase in construction material, we now need much more than this. We have partnered with the Dutch charity Little Leaders Foundation, which is assisting us with fundraising in Europe, while Bridging Lanka is helping us from Australia. We are also hoping for generous corporations and individuals keen to help us out.         You gave up a lucrative career in the UAE training racehorses and decided to come here and start this project. What made you do it? Sri Lanka has always had a deep place in my heart. I love this country and the people, and whenever I came to Sri Lanka, I felt it was home. When I completed my studies and began racing, I didn’t feel fulfilled or that my passion was being enriched, so I came to Sri Lanka. I saw how much needs to be done in this country with so much hope for people to take advantage of. There is a bright future for Sri Lanka. I think more people need to come here and believe in it. Ultimately, what is your vision in a wider sense? To do my small part in making Sri Lanka a safer, more wholesome place by helping the community. We need more love and kindness in the world, and with that, we can and will build better communities.

The orb, roughly 5ft (1.5m) in diameter, washed up on Enshu beach in the Pacific coastal city of Hamamatsu this week, forcing beachgoers to evacuate and leaving authorities clueless about what it was for and where it was from.   But the ball bears a striking resemblance to a steel buoy made by Chinese shipbuilding company Nantong Yangfan, made in similar sizes and used to guide mariners or mark positions in the ocean.   The company is based in China's coastal Jiangsu province in eastern China, supporting arguments the buoy simply broke away and floated east towards Japan.   On Tuesday, Japanese authorities deployed bomb disposal squads to the shoreline amid initial fears it could be a sea mine.   They built a 600 ft perimeter around the scene and prevented public access.   But an X-ray of the object revealed its rusted metal shell was merely a casing, its insides hollowed out.    There were no indications it was a surveillance or espionage device deployed by nearby foes China and North Korea.    After the initial panic ended, some theorised that the sphere was a mooring buoy, given the raised handle that could be used to hook a rope, that had become detached and floated away.    These metallic buoys usually contain more components inside the outer casing to aid buoyancy, and not everything supported the theory.    The shell appears to be coloured with a faint yellow hue, with patches of brown likely caused by rust.   Investigators at the scene took several photographs of the sphere and said they had sent the images to the coast guard and the armed forces for further inspection and examination.   Locals interviewed by Japanese broadcaster   NHK   said they'd also inspected the object and then had no idea what it was.    “I tried to push it, but it wouldn't budge,” one man told   NHK  .    Despite investigators' insistence the orb was not of Chinese origin, there were still concerns about the provenance of the object amid recent tensions between Tokyo and Beijing.   Following the downing of a suspected Chinese spy balloon by the United States, Japanese authorities last week said it planned to clarify military engagement rules to allow its jet fighters to shoot down unmanned aircraft that violate its airspace.    Yesterday, at the Asian powers' first formal security talks in four years, Tokyo took aim at Beijing's military ties to Russia and its suspected use of spy balloons in Japanese skies.   The talks, aimed at easing tensions between the world's second- and third-largest economies, came as Tokyo worries that Beijing will resort to force to take control of Taiwan in the wake of Russia's attack on Ukraine, sparking a conflict that could embroil Japan and disrupt global trade.   Japan in December said it would double defence spending over the next five years to 2% of gross domestic product - a total of $ 320 billion - to deter China from resorting to military action.    Beijing, which increased defence spending by 7.1% last year, spends more than four times as much as Japan on its forces.   “While relations between Japan and China have a lot of possibilities, we are also facing many issues and concerns,” Japanese Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Shigeo Yamada told his Chinese counterpart.   He pointed to their territorial dispute over uninhabited islands in the East China Sea known as the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, Beijing's recent joint military drills with Moscow and the suspected Chinese surveillance balloons spotted over Japan at least three times since 2019.

The President of the Sri Lanka Automotive Component Manufacturers Association (SLACMA) Dimantha Jayawardena said in a press release: “Sri Lankan automotive component manufacturers have gone through the toughest business cycle from 2020 and through the current economic crisis. Most manufacturers have survived. Some are still trying to make the best following the temporary suspension of imported brands, while others are suffering due to low market demand as well as inability to source raw materials.”   In addition to being President of SLACMA, Dimantha Jayawardena is the Chairman of the Automobile Sector Advisory Committee for Automobile Components Manufacturing and Assembly Related Industry of the Ministry of Industries (MoI), and a member of the Industrialisation Commission appointed by the President. He is also a member of the Board of Directors and Advisor to several companies.   Jayawardena said that the MoI was able to help most of the manufacturers during the hardest times by the allocation of the Indian Credit Line to source raw materials. “It was extremely commendable that the Ministry of Industries took an initial step to help most of the manufacturers who were affected by the temporary suspension, by reviewing and lifting the restrictions following justification of the imports to the MoI. In addition, high interest rates have been severely impacting the industry, and many small-scale manufacturers had to wind up operations during the past year.”    He said that the SLACMA has tried its best to support its members by getting involved in necessary interventions via the Ministry of Industries to safeguard the industry. “As the industry tries to come out of the worst times, SLACMA is now in the process of getting its manufacturers certified by the  International Automotive Task Force  (IATF) to the 16949 international standard. This endeavour is 50% funded by the Ministry of Industries.

One of the overseas players who has really paid dividends for the franchise is Sri Lanka's Bhanuka Rajapaksa. However, owing to fitness issues, the batter was almost snubbed by PBKS, only for the then-head coach Anil Kumble to push for Sri Lanka.

Fernando is a fashion designer, stylist, and fashion photographer, and is today (11) launching the 11th edition of the Raffealla Fernando Celebrity Calendar (RFCC). She also has another calendar launching later this month, for which her photography targets a different community compared to the stars and celebrities we are used to seeing on RFCC.   Speaking to   The Morning Brunch  , Fernando shared that this year, RFCC features 26 artists, of which 15 are new faces for the calendar.      RFCC 2023   “Getting extremely young talent like Kanchana Anuradhi and many more on board elevates the calendar, because we are featuring young talent amidst an overall talented bunch of people. Additionally, since these are new faces and people have not seen that flavour in the calendar, they are quite keen to see it,” she said.   Another example is actress Chandani Senavirathne, who is featured in this year’s RFCC. “She has not done any shoots for the past 15-18 years and she doesn’t want to do photoshoots either, so working with her and then seeing everyone going crazy over her teaser video, eager to see her on the calendar, feels really exciting,” Fernando shared, adding that until she sees people’s reactions, it is hard to know if they really want to see a change with the RFCC. She added that actress Nimmi Harasgama is also featured in this edition.   “It’s a huge change, and it’s new for me as well. Like I said, it’s the first time that we have so many first-timers for the RFCC, so it’s a new experience for me and I’m super excited to have these people. Seeing all the feedback makes the entire team extremely happy, and I think it’s going to be quite a satisfying change once it’s done and out.”   Despite these changes, RFCC will continue to feature the best in the business at the time, balancing prominent personalities with young talent.   The highlight of the calendar this year is that it features a global icon – actress Jacqueline Fernandez. Fernando plans on promoting the calendar in India as well, a huge step for the calendar. The calendar will stick to its theme of conceptualised photography, but with different concepts and styles, with fashion and glamour in the spotlight.    “I have my first transgender representation in the calendar – Bhoomi Harendran. This time, we want to cater to a different market and also have a purpose to it, where we can empower people in a certain way, and this is why we have Bhoomi, because she’s one of a kind.”      From celebrity to corporate   She also spoke about her other calendar project, titled Dynamic Business Leader (DBL) 2023 by Raffaella Fernando. While she is initiating the project, the concept is by Hashtag Media, and Fernando said many well-known faces are featured on it. This is the first edition of DBL, but it will be a yearly project, and is the start of something new.   “It’s a completely different experience. RFCC is very creative and conceptualised, with storytelling, and then you have DBL, which is more sophisticated. It’s very different, and it’s not the usual corporate shots either, because I wanted to bring my element into it. So it’s something different, but at the same time, it’s a motivational calendar,” she said, explaining that this is the idea behind the DBL calendar.   Fernando went on to say that having two different styles of work releasing in the same month is good for her portfolio, as she is shooting two different kinds of flavours with the projects.   Going into detail about the work she did in 2022, Fernando told us that she did a promotional photoshoot of Jacqueline Fernandez for Rohit Shetty’s   Cirkus  , in which she stars. This was the main purpose for her visit to Mumbai, India last month, and she did a couple of shoots while there.   Fernando was also able to work on a fusion fashion film as a photographer. “There was a video and photoshoot with two models and also an actress named Supra Singh, from the teledrama industry. It was a fusion of traditional Gujarat outfits, and I was also able to do a Sri Lankan representation with the Kandyan sari – We were there to push our fashion into it.”   This was one of the most interesting projects she undertook, and she said she was able to do a very successful traditional fusion, with portfolio shoots for actors and models. Despite being a short trip, Fernando said they were able to do a lot of work, and are planning to go back and continue what they started.      Exploring talents and platforms   When asked about her experience working in different countries as well as industries, Fernando shared that she felt it was extremely important for artists to explore their talents and other platforms.    “Each country works differently. The mechanism is different,” she said, adding that she has worked in India previously as well, but her work in Chennai and Goa was more to do with fashion and print media, and not Bollywood.   She has also worked in London, Italy, and France, and shared that these countries work differently. “It’s very important that we push ourselves to work with these industries and with these people. There is so much to learn, and we become better artists with time, by working with their celebrities.”   Fernando also spoke about working with Korean actress Eugene Lee two years ago, saying it was a completely different experience.   “I feel it’s very important that we push the bar, which I’m constantly trying to do. I feel we will not go anywhere as an industry if we don’t push ourselves to do better, and we can’t do that by staying only in Sri Lanka. Our country is very small and just like the country, our industries too are still developing.”      A busy year   With two calendars releasing this month, Fernando’s year is off to a great start, and she said it’s already looking good and bright. Promising campaign shoots and more photography work will follow the calendars.    “Mid this year, I am planning to relaunch my clothing line. I’m not going to be doing custom orders anymore, so it’s going to be more retail and more approachable, where we can expand it internationally,” she said, adding that she is also planning on releasing her first book in September or October.    It’s a survival diary, she said, adding: “It’s about the different states of mental illness and photography with poetry. This is something interesting; although not very commercial, I think it will be something tasteful for art lovers. These are what I have in mind for the rest of the year.”     ",TRUE,CIZLop1eNQgLt0ggozjxXC5H1Zm1,Wasantha Warnakulasuriya,0,"Raffealla Fernando believes that pushing the bar is a necessity, not just for individuals but for industries as a whole, and this is something that is made clear by her work over the years",,0,1673408862,902000000,04mA9Yp0z5KhzrBbYZjC,,"Raffealla Fernando, a fashion designer, stylist, and photographer, is launching the 11th edition of the Raffealla Fernando Celebrity Calendar (RFCC).

It is a well-known fact that a number of organised crime groups, especially ones involved in the narcotics trade, are managed by key figures who are held behind bars. These individuals, and those absconding overseas – particularly in India, Dubai, and other Middle East countries – continue to control Sri Lanka’s vast organised crime networks, with a degree of impunity which is increasing.     The prisons system in Sri Lanka has many issues, many of which have been long-lasting and systemic. Prison overcrowding, lack of standards, and appalling conditions in most prisons are well known, and likely will take long-term restructuring and retraining to change. The Human Rights Commissions of Sri Lanka published a report based on a study of the Sri Lankan prison system in 2018, which describes in detail the various shortcomings and gaps in the prison system in Sri Lanka. However, the most apparent and recurrent crisis within prisons is the compromised nature of prison administration and the jailors who serve in prisons.   The recent finding of a number of mobile phones – specialised battery packs within the wards which house organised crime convicts – is a clear indication of how weak and porous the prisons administration is. The fact that a team of Special Task Force officers had been brought in from outside to find the contraband is telling of how effective and uncompromised the prison officials are in carrying out their basic duties. This amidst a continued crime wave in the Southern and Western Provinces of the island, with turf wars being fought between different organised crime groups, and vendettas being pursued. There is also an alarming trend of killing witnesses and former drug peddlers who have turned State witness, before they can speak their piece before the court. For those who have been following the chronology and trends of crime – particularly the narcotics trade – the collusion between some law enforcement, State, and prison officials and organised crime groups comes as no surprise.   In 2020, Ministry of Defence Secretary Maj. Gen. (Retd.) Kamal Gunaratne said the Special Task Force (STF) had deployed in the outer perimeters of the Welikada Prison and  Colombo Remand Prison – and at Angunakolapelessa Prison – to strengthen security. He said the decision was taken, especially, to provide more protection to these prisons and to thwart illegal activities, such as smuggling drugs and using mobile phones to operate crimes from prison cells. The move came after drugs, SIM cards, and mobile phones were once again detected from the Welikada Prison, which is Sri Lanka’s largest prison, and which includes the Magazine Remand Prison. Ironically, the Government had moved to install GSM phone radio frequency jammers at Welikada, Boossa, and other prisons, only to find that some prisons officials had routinely turned them off, or mapped “dead zones” so that their crime patrons in confinement could find the right place to receive calls and give out instructions.   Some years ago, several external parties and some in the intelligence community had recommended that the Government – under the Ministry of Justice or a similar authority – establish a completely new vetted unit, to take on corrections duties at high risk prisons where key organised criminal personalities would have been held. However, this did not happen, and why it failed to get off the ground remains a mystery. The Government and the Ministry of Defence later proposed a tactic which the former Government was fond of – and which the current administration seems to approve of – to recruit a number of ex-military officers for the task. While that may have been plausible in other countries, the involvement of ex-military personnel in organised crime – particularly as guns for hire – leaves the idea questionable. Why the Government is not keen to establish a new, civilian-led, well-trained, equipped, and vetted team to tackle prisons and law enforcement challenges, remains an unanswered question.

Although Sri Lanka is a democracy where the public’s interests should be the foremost priority, it appears that the interests of the public have been subdued by those of the political and public authorities.   This situation became more apparent during the past year, when a number of incidents, which amounted to a violation of the public’s fundamental rights, transpired in the context of the aragalaya (the people’s movement to overthrow the then Government led by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa) which sought to depose the former Government due to the economic crisis that broke out during its tenure. One demand that was at the centre of the aragalaya’s demands was that a more responsible, accountable and a transparent Government be established following the resignation of the former Government. However, despite various positive developments such as legal and institutional reforms, it appears that the country has a very long way to go in order to achieve responsibility, accountability and transparency related aspects in various crucial affairs of the country.   The public’s right to information, which has been guaranteed under the Fundamental Rights Chapter in the Constitution, is such an area. Despite that right being a Constitutionally guaranteed one and despite Sri Lanka having set up an independent Commission to protect that right through the Right to Information (RTI) Act, No. 12 of 2016, the actual benefits of the Act seems to have been limited due to practical challenges faced by the enforcement of the same.   As was clearly seen during the past few years, there is a trend of public authorities and the law enforcement and armed forces defying lawful RTI requests which are in accordance with the Act. The Parliament’s reluctance in revealing the names of Members of Parliament who have and have not submitted their assets and liabilities declarations, the Litro Gas’s reluctance in revealing the salaries of certain top-most officials, and the Police’s reluctance in revealing information about tear gas that was used during the aragalaya period, are merely a few examples. The newest such failure of unwillingness to respond to a RTI request was reported from the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) recently. This was when the SLAF had claimed that it did not receive two consecutive RTI requests which sought to obtain information on the number of times Rajapaksa had travelled by SLAF aircrafts from the first week of April to 15 July, 2022, the relevant dates on which he travelled, the places of departure and destination, the number of persons who accompanied him, the total cost incurred for each trip, how the trips were approved, and who paid the relevant fees, although the RTI Commission had observed that those requests had been sent to the SLAF's relevant electronic mail address.    In some of the aforementioned cases and in many other such cases, the authorities attempted to use grounds such the requested information being an official’s personal information, and information being of national security related interests, and information not being available, while the non-receipt of RTI requests has on many occasions been cited as the reason for not responding to such requests. While some of these concerns may be true, it is an undeniable fact that there is a severe lethargy or unwillingness on the part of public authorities when it comes to revealing information, even if the provision of such information is clearly not a threat to any party and is not related to any ongoing or future activity. In addition, certain public authorities have not adequately cooperated with the RTI Commission and its hearings, while some went beyond to challenge the RTI Commission’s role and powers.   One of the most concerning aspects of this situation, which has been underscored by the RTI Commission, is the fact that some of the information requested through the RTI Act is in fact information that should ideally be proactively disclosed to the public by public authorities. However, times are such that the public has had to request, appeal and struggle in the process of getting information in order to get information about public authorities, public servants and public representatives who are maintained by the public, to serve the public.   Sri Lanka needs to understand that foreign funds and debt restructuring alone will not help the nation to recover economically and heal. Debt restructuring will only bring short term relief. For Sri Lanka to recover and stabilise, become the country where youth wish to live in, more needs to be done. The Right to Information Act can be used to be transparent and build confidence in our governance system not only for our citizens but for potential investors and trade partners.

According to the Export Development Board (EDB), Sri Lanka’s merchandise exports decreased by 8.89% ($ 1.001 billion) in January 2023, compared to 2022.    The apparel and textile sector alone has seen a negative growth of -17.7% for merchandise exports, which is a drop from $ 514 million to $ 423 million by January 2023.   According to JAAF Deputy Chairperson Felix Fernando, the dip in exports did not come as a surprise.   “This did not come as a surprise. We were expecting that to happen; for the first six months of 2022 there weren’t many orders, mainly due to the global recession and reduced trade in the US and EU markets,” Fernando explained.   He stated that post-Covid stockpiling by traditional markets and slow market momentum had also added to the reduction in orders for local apparel.   When asked what could be done to assist the export industries, particularly the award-winning apparel sector to improve exports, Fernando called on the Government to improve market access for exports.    He also called for the Government to move expeditiously to secure the at-risk GSP Plus trade concessions, which greatly aid Sri Lankan apparel exports to maintain competitiveness in key EU markets.   In particular, Fernando requested the Government to expedite the ongoing dialogue with India to increase market access.    According to him, the current trade agreements allow Sri Lanka to export eight million items of apparels to India, whereas Bangladesh and other nations have negotiated better terms.    Fernando pointed out that with only eight million items, the scope of exports to India was significantly limited.   Further, Fernando said that Sri Lanka should consider a relief mechanism for export industries in relation to the recent electricity price tariff hike.   “We understand that everyone has to pay more, but this scale of payment for industry may cripple us soon,” he opined.

The impact of the crisis may worsen the already dismal level of women’s representation in governance, leadership and participation in decision-making processes, a report by several international agencies has found.     The effects of the economic crisis have created a multi-dimensional crisis with increasing economic, health, social, and protection risks impacting the wellbeing of the people. In the current context, the economic wellbeing of women will be impacted as the sectors where women are predominantly employed have been directly affected. These sectors include the apparel, tea/rubber plantations, micro and small and medium enterprises (SME) and the informal economy, among others. The majority of women are in precarious jobs or not in waged work, pushing them further into poverty.   The recently released “Rapid Gender Analysis Sri Lanka 2022” explained that at present, women’s representation and participation in decision-making at all levels of governance are severely limited, and that in such a context, the impact of the crisis on the autonomy, protection, and wellbeing of women is likely to cause further regression in women’s full participation and leadership in society and governance. This will, in turn, further de-prioritise the needs, rights, and empowerment of women in response, recovery, and development measures, as per the report, which was based on a research conducted by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in collaboration with CARE International and Chrysalis.   The study paid attention to a number of matters including paid work, unpaid work, access to services and resources, food security and nutrition, access to opportune health serves (including sexual and reproductive health), education, safety and protection, gender-based violence, violence and harassment at work, physical safety mental health, participation, capacity and coping mechanisms and mobility.      Key findings   The report noted that although the crisis has changed gender roles, nonetheless, it is largely exacerbating preexisting gender and intersectional inequalities and discrimination: “Gender roles are changing in Sri Lanka. The interviews suggest that some men who have lost their main source of income also report an increasing care role and support with household activities, as they are less engaged in income generating activities. Consequently, with men becoming unemployed, women report taking on new roles and multiple jobs to make up for the lost family income. However, the sudden change in the role of men as the main breadwinners has become a source of anxiety for them.”   It further added that the crisis has affected the living standards of Sri Lankans and is pushing previously middle-income households toward poverty. The economic crisis has predominantly affected the increasingly high living standard of people in Sri Lanka, irrespective of the economic sector, heavily impacting the healthy development of the economy, and visibly impacting middle to low-income sectors both in rural and urban areas. However, the interviews have shown that rural communities are more resilient to the economic challenges and changes in lifestyle created by the lack of food, and the shortages of fuel, than urban communities.   In addition, the report explained that both female and male respondents had highlighted the importance of the stabilisation of fuel distribution, and the subsidisation of food, electricity, water and transportation prices for them to be able to respond to their basic livelihood needs with their work. They had emphasised the importance of access to credit programmes, and business training opportunities. In most cases, participants in the Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) had emphasised the importance of access to income opportunities for them to be able to provide what was needed.   Adding that women are disproportionately affected by the multi-sectoral and compounded impact of the crisis, the report noted: “Women’s care burden has increased significantly with the electricity shortages, and the lack of gas and fuel, doubling the time they spent on unpaid domestic chores. The disruption of education for children and the shortages of food have also added stress and responsibilities to women’s role as the head of the household. The most visible barrier experienced by women and menstruating persons in urban and rural areas, irrespective of their economic sector or place of dwelling, is the difficulty to access Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) services/products, since the prices for water services, sanitary napkins, and soaps have increased. Women are leading community based organisations and meetings and keeping the relationships within the communities has been added to their list of responsibilities.”   The stressors related to the multi-dimensional crisis combined with minimal services for gender based violence and access to protection mechanisms have seen an increase in violence against women and children. According to the report, domestic violence has increased as loss of jobs, family income and increased anxiety levels have led to negative coping mechanisms, and with the increase in reports of drug and alcohol use, the nature and intensity of domestic violence appears to have intensified.      Recommendations   The recommendations put forward in the report include those which constitute general gender-responsive good practices in intersectional humanitarian response and also others that arise directly from the findings of the report.   The report recommended to ensure that humanitarian assistance addresses the needs of women, men, girls, and boys in vulnerable situations and from different marginalised groups, including special attention to female heads of households, persons with disabilities, older women and men, pregnant and breastfeeding women, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) persons, sex workers and those key groups of workers already at risk of violence and harassment before the crisis (domestic workers, informal sector workers, and migrant workers).   Ensuring that information on services, access and rights is widely available and accessible to all sections of the crisis-affected population, taking into consideration language, access to technology, preferred and trusted communications channels and formats, and gender roles, was also recommended.   The report added: “Ensure that all actors collect and share sex, age- and disability-disaggregated data (SADDD) and prioritise transparency and the sharing of non-identifiable data collected, in order to ensure greater access to information and reduce duplication. This aims to reduce assessment fatigue, the re-traumatization of respondents, and the general burden on the affected populations, as well as safeguard humanitarian staff and volunteers. Confirm that donors ensure that all funded proposals and interventions include gender analysis and the use of SADDD and have budgets dedicated to addressing gender considerations, requiring the use of gender markers for the allocation of funds. Ensure that community members, particularly women and people in vulnerable situations and from different marginalised groups, have information on their rights in terms of humanitarian assistance as well as how to report misconduct. Ensure that all actors involved in the response adhere to the principles of zero-tolerance for sexual exploitation, abuse, and harassment (SEAH), with established codes of conduct and PSEAH protocols for each staff member, including for implementing partners, consultants and volunteers.”   Collecting further information regarding the preferred and trusted means of two-way communication by men and women and among different population groups, including men and women with restricted mobility due to the crises, was another recommendation, with which it was also recommended to ensure that humanitarian coordination and planning processes led by the United Nations and the Government meaningfully consult with representative women’s civil society and create opportunities for their participation in decision-making. Design cash delivery modalities, including the timing and mechanism of distribution, in consultation with women and vulnerable populations. Therefore, ensuring that gender based violence risk mitigation measures are in place, as well as taking into consideration women’s household care duties, the ease of movement, perceived stigma for sex workers, discrimination against groups such as LGTB persons, access to financial institutions, and familiarity with technology such as mobile phones.   “In terms of changes in gender roles and relations brought by the crisis, any humanitarian delivery of services and assistance needs to factor in that women report engaging in multiple jobs to make up for the lost family income and doubling the time they spent in unpaid domestic chores, therefore no extra burden can be added,” the report said, adding that for men, the loss of their role as main income earners positively impacts in some cases their support with child-rearing but negatively impacts on self-esteem and can lead to negative coping mechanisms.    “In food security, it had been already surveyed during the pandemic and with the economic crisis again women have reduced their food intake as a negative coping mechanism to prioritise their children’s and husbands’ needs. Therefore, food assistance needs to be tailored to the specific needs of women and children, including adequate and appropriate nutritional food for older people, pregnant and breastfeeding mothers, children under the age of five, and people with chronic illnesses.”   In terms of WASH, it was recommended to facilitate access to sanitary products and underwear for women of reproductive age, through the distribution of hygiene and dignity kits. Although it did not come up in the discussions pertaining to the research in the report, incontinence materials should also be included for older women and men. In addition, ensuring access to life saving sexual and reproductive health services aligned with the Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) for SRH in crisis settings received attention.   It added: “In prevention, mitigation, and response to GBV, humanitarian actors advocate for more support, resources, and funding to address the increased risk of gender based violence caused by the crisis. Humanitarian action should strengthen and complement government services and fill in gaps where existing. Particularly, humanitarian actors could provide safe shelters for survivors of domestic violence and their children.”         ",TRUE,CIZLop1eNQgLt0ggozjxXC5H1Zm1,Wasantha Warnakulasuriya,0,"The lives of people in Sri Lanka have been impacted by an economic crisis in 2022, which also triggered protests and strikes across the country",,0,1682276419,0,06j8vgDGVryDhdqWHruC,,"The economic crisis in Sri Lanka has significantly impacted the lives of people, leading to protests and strikes.

However, these days, blaming the weather for pretty much everything is fashionable – be it global warming or cooling, no rain, or too much rain, drought, floods, or a snow blizzard in winter.   Recently, the news was filled with stories of anthropogenic climate catastrophes, from “poisoned fog” from land-locked dust bowl New Delhi, India, directly targeting windblown coastal Colombo, to cattle dying due to cold weather in the Eastern Province. Additionally, there were biowarfare-lab-made Fall Army Worms (Sena Caterpillar), and coconut White Flies destroying crops in a mysteriously co-ordinated attack on national food security this holiday season, as imported goods flooded Sri Lanka on the (neo)liberal US “force”-backed President’s orders, rapidly deepening the US dollar debt trap, ex-post the staged default.   Meanwhile, two United Nations (UN) Climate Conferences (the 27th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change [COP-27] and the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity), the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), offered contradictory messages about who must bear the cost for the “loss and damage” caused by climate change amid a global and local corporate media blitz of climate disaster stories with narratives of famine in the background. Indeed, climate and debt anxiety cross-messaging with electric car and green technology advertisements, as well as disinformation following two years of a confusing Covid-19 infodemic increasingly characterise an anxiety-gripped “risk society” in a post-truth world.   At the COP-27 Anthropocene climate catastrophe show in Egypt in November last year (2022), countries of the Global South called for the industrialised North, which is currently responsible for over 92% of cumulative carbon emissions, to pay up for the “loss and damage” to the environment.      Land and ocean grabbing for blue-green debt bondage      Strategic Sri Lanka at the centre of the Indian Ocean, which succumbed to a staged default for the first time in its history as an independent country last year (2022), is currently in IMF and colonial Club de Paris debt negotiations that include green and blue bonds or “debt for nature” swap (DFNS).   A blue-green deal of up to $ 1 billion in climate-focused finance is planned, according to a   Reuters   report. However,  countries in the Global South had pointed out that industrialised Euro-American nations that caused the carbon emissions and ozone holes must pay up for any green transition at COP-27, rather than appropriate the forest lands and ocean resources of debt-trapped countries in the name of “environment conservation” that takes the form of corporate green bonds, or DFNS. Moreover, the valuation of the blue ocean and green forest “assets” to be traded are opaque, with no mention of the submarine undersea data cables in the strategic island’s maritime exclusive economic zone.   The proposed blue-green bond trade, as part of debt restructuring, would again benefit the unknown international sovereign bond (ISB) holders and hedge funds of countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which include BlackRock that staged the default in Sri Lanka amid a triple whammy of Covid-19, climate catastrophe, and debt disaster narratives in the global and local corporate media.   Meanwhile, a recent  2020 OECD report found that the richer nations have never reached the promised $ 100 billion for climate financing, and what is worse is that instead of providing the promised climate fund, a majority of the climate finance from high-income nations to low-income countries took the form of loans that deepen debt traps.   The IMF and the Paris Club are pushing for a quick debt restructuring deal in Sri Lanka that would include green and blue (forest and ocean) bonds, and the unbundling and sale of strategic lands, coastal areas, energy, transport, telecom, and State-owned assets, enterprises, and infrastructure amid “expert” narratives of famine and climate crisis. These narratives enable disaster capitalism à la Canadian social activist Prof. Naomi Klein’s classic work   The Shock Doctrine  , this time with a blue-green mask in the strategic Indian Ocean island in the crosshairs of geopolitical tensions as a cold war heats up in the Indian Ocean region.   Some have suggested that the forests and oceans of Sri Lanka are doubly valuable, even priceless, due to the island’s geostrategic location on major trade, energy and submarine or undersea data cable routes, in the age of big data and the information economy. The island has also been dubbed an “unsinkable aircraft carrier”, with the country increasingly an economic proxy war site in the West’s confrontation with China, much like Ukraine is a proxy war site in the confrontation with Russia. The Sino-Russia pact of “limitless” co-operation in the long-predicted Asian 21st Century seems to have unnerved the West.   Meanwhile, in small print, there was also the news that India would enable Sri Lanka to trade in Indian rupees, aiding the quiet de-dollarisation process in this dollar debt-trapped island, which was, till recently, listed as South Asia’s only upper middle-income country by the World Bank. Before the dramatic default triggered currency devaluation, Sri Lanka had the highest gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and the best social indicators in the region.      Odious debt bondage and the semiotics of a chilling killing: Cui bono?      Recently, a member of a powerful business family was found deceased in what seemed, at first glance, to be a mafia-style staged crime that seemed designed to send a chilling message and to silence those among the business community and the wider society who question the official narrative and quantum of debt, bonds, and bond scams at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), in a world where debt data like Covid-19 fatality rates and artificial intelligence (AI)-generated weather data are a numbers game with contradictory models.   Dinesh Schaffter, a scion of a powerful and respected business family, was a primary material witness at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry that investigated the 2015 CBSL bond scam that is widely alleged to have been authorised by then-Prime Minister and current President Ranil Wickremesinghe in 2015 also to fund his party’s (United National Party) election campaign. Schaffter, the Managing Director of First Capital Holdings, a company that had also placed bids at the time, had raised questions regarding the bond auction. Subsequent court action revealed insider trading allegedly by primary dealer Perpetual Treasuries, with Wickremesinghe’s friend in Singapore, then-CBSL Governor Arjuna Mahendran, and his son-in-law Arjun Aloysius of Perpetual Treasuries, all part of the bond scam network.   The semiotics of the guillotine-style killing, with the victim left in his own car at the Colombo General Cemetery indicates a crime staged to send a chilling message to those who may seek the truth or dare speak truth to power. This is at a time when a group of high-powered international academics have called for transparency and information disclosure regarding the identities of the bondholders, whose names are kept secret while the country is mortgaged in IMF and Paris Club negotiations to pay and benefit bondholders.   The academics have also called for ISB holders who lent at predatory rates claiming “high risk” to bear the cost of their predatory practices and to take the losses, rather than have the IMF and the colonial Club de Paris act as their debt collectors, while passing on the burden of this odious and illegitimate debt transacted between two corrupt parties (corrupt politicians and hedge fund bond traders) to the citizens of debt-trapped countries in the Global South, who had little to do with these transactions and are denied the right to information on the identities of the bondholders.      It is the bonds, stupid! The right to information      Forensic audit reports on the 2015 bond scams were embargoed by then-CBSL Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, who is now an “advisor” on debt restructuring talks with the IMF. Is it not time to first reveal the findings of the 2015 bond scam audit reports in full to Parliament and the people of Sri Lanka? The three Governors of the CBSL who were involved in bond scams and/or cover-up “investigations” include Ajith Nivard Cabraal, Mahendran, and Dr. Coomaraswamy.   However, rather than call for information disclosure, Opposition members trade in salacious stories about beds, bestiality, bondage, and the sexual preferences and exploits of the President (who now enjoys Presidential immunity), as well as his advisors, which are widely circulated in corporate and social media channels to distract from the thickening plot of past and future bond scams conducted with impunity and immunity to beggar the country by successive Wickremesinghe-Rajapaksa (a reference to former Presidents Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Mahinda Rajapaksa) governments.   The apparent staging and semiotics of the assassination of Schaffter, who was to depart for London, England on the eve of his death, points to powerful local and global interests and networks behind the scene, drunk with a sense of immunity and impunity. The perpetrators of the crime in broad daylight in central Colombo clearly felt well protected, and no investigation could or would touch them, as the progress of the investigation seems to show.   The chilling killing would simultaneously stymie any bond scam investigations and search for information on the identities of the bondholders. This is also evident in the ongoing cover-up “investigation”, including the absurd narrative that the victim died by suicide.   It appears that Schaffter knew too much and was willing and able to ask questions at a time when bond trading related to the country’s debt default is under scrutiny, with calls for transparency and information demanded from ISB traders and bondholders complicit in the default being made by academics and civil society groups, as the IMF prepares to asset-strip the country to benefit Euro-American creditors.   Finally, the semiotics of Schaffter’s assassination and the ongoing cover-up “investigations” are similar to the Islamic State (IS)-claimed Easter Sunday attacks that also targeted the Chinese-owned Shangri La Hotel in Colombo, where the leader of the suicide attacks, Zahran Hashim, died with another suicide bomber in 2019. This was shortly after the World Bank had “upgraded” Sri Lanka to an upper-middle income country, forcing the country to borrow from private capital markets and bond traders to recover after the hybrid economic war-style Easter attacks. At that time, Wickremesinghe was the Prime Minister.   Four years after the mysterious Easter Sunday 2019 crime, the smokescreen of investigations by various local and international intelligence agencies has thickened, while investigators and court cases continue to ignore prima facie evidence regarding the external geopolitical motives and local, global, and diasporic transnational networks that are as clear as daylight behind the 2019 IS-claimed Easter Sunday crime.

For years, Sri Lanka women’s cricket has not been treated the same way as men’s cricket. However, the pay raise on the match fees is a big step in the correct direction.    The Executive Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) took a decision to raise the match fees of the national women’s players for the year 2023. As a result, match fees for both formats of white-ball cricket have increased from $ 250 to $ 750 per match, per player. Each reserve player in the squad will receive 25% of the match fee.   Furthermore, for each match won by the team, whether in a bilateral or international tournament, each player will receive a $ 250 winning bonus. This is a big step in the right direction as SLC also established a high-performance training facility for women in 2021 at the P. Sara Oval Cricket Stadium, following an MoU that Sri Lanka Cricket signed with the Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic Club.   According to the MoU, the P. Sara Oval ground, side wickets, indoor nets, gymnasium, swimming pool, and the dormitory facilities of the Tamil Union will be used to develop the women’s game.

Described as the first step towards eliminating gender discrimination, the hike is significant given the prior fixed match fee of Indian rupees (INR) 100,000 per match for limited-overs matches and INR 400,000 per Test match.    However, there were no changes to the annual contract as India’s women cricketers are slotted into pay brackets similar to the male cricketers, but have lower contracts.   “The female cricketers will be paid the same match fee as their male counterparts, Test (INR 1,500,000), ODI (INR 600,000), T20I (INR 300,000).

Speaking to The Daily Morning yesterday (14), ECA General Secretary Sanjeewa Dhammika alleged that the Ministry of Power and Energy has appointed a consultant for the said office on 27 July, who will be acting as its head.    “This consultant has been hired for a period of eight and a half months. He is required to come to the office for just 15 days a month. It has been decided to pay a monthly payment of $ 7,300. According to current exchange rates, it amounts to about Rs. 2.4 million. For the relevant period, the Government will spend Rs. 20 million on his salary alone.”   He also said that the ministry is to recruit a few more consultants and officials for the said office and that a credit facility offered by Japan would be utilised to pay them. “There are several persons waiting to be appointed as consultants and officers. The ministry has decided to allocate a sum of $ 300,000 to pay the salaries of these consultants and officers. In this manner, a sum of about Rs. 1 billion will be wasted. All this is happening at a time when the country is not even able to repay its foreign debt.”   Speaking further, Dhammika charged that the relevant authorities, such as the Auditor General’s Department and the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, are also apathetic over the matter. “There is no point in lodging complaints with the relevant institutions as nothing happens in the end. However, we call on all electricity consumers to raise their voices against this fruitless expenditure. If not, it is the electricity consumers who will have to bear these expenses in the end,” he said.   Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera was not available for comment.   The CEB owns and operates around 70% of the country’s electricity generation capacity, and currently serves around 6.8 million retail consumers. The process of reforming the CEB commenced last year (2022) with the appointment of a committee after considering the Cabinet memorandums dated 29 July 2022, 15 August 2022, and 2 September 2022, which were submitted with the intention of making institutional reforms to the power sector.

Many seem to be too quick to determine who is to blame, and in that race, it seems as if Sri Lanka is focused on the parental responsibility aspect of this incident. There is no debate that the abovementioned death is tragic and should not have occurred. Sadly, the outcry and mourning of the loss of this young Sri Lankan’s life, will eventually end many would forget this incident, the same way we forgot many others that occurred before. However, as a nation we need to do better.   If we are to learn anything from the Mulleriyawa’s incident, and the many infant/child tragedies of the past, the public should look at not just what transpired, but what created a situation where such a tragedy was possible. Otherwise, our criticisms or assessments of the abovementioned incident would be unfair, and most importantly, not teach us the lessons we ought to learn. Many have expressed different opinions as to who was in the wrong in the Mulleriyawa’s incident. While some blame the child’s grandfather for being negligent, some believe that it was the child’s parents that should be held accountable. While some think that the grass cutter was at the wrong place at the wrong time, some feel that he should take the responsibility for what befell the child. However, when looking at the larger picture, we can see many victims of circumstances - circumstances that were created or exacerbated by socio-economic and poor-governance related issues as well. It is clear that the child’s mother had to leave the child with the grandfather as she had to make ends meet, while the grandfather and grandmother had to, despite their old age and failing health, become a babysitter. This has been a cultural phenomenon, one which has come under significant strain in recent times.   Leaving children, including those who are merely a couple of months old, in the care of grandparents is not new to Sri Lanka. In many cases, it is due to familiar bonds, or the belief that leaving children with a blood relative, even if they were incapable of handling a child, is safer. However, it is quite common to leave children with grandparents, regardless of their age and mental and physical capabilities, because parents lack the wherewithal necessary to hire a capable and skilled person or an institution to look after their children. Although daycare centres or babysitter services were considered within reach of those in the middle class families not too long ago, yet in the prevailing dire economic situations, it has become a luxury only a few could afford. In the case of daily wage workers, the ability to obtain such services is significantly low or near impossible, leaving with them with the options of either taking their children to workplaces, which in many cases is risky, or leaving their children with grandparents, in which cases there is very little assurance about children’s safety, as many elderly persons have their own challenges to face, with detonating attentiveness and mobility, being some of the issues.   Not just children, grandparents are also impacted with the socio-economic crisis that we have all weathered in the recent past. Having to look after grandchildren because grandparents cannot refuse that support for their struggling children is also challenging, and in some cases, could even be called abusive, due to many reasons such as grandparents’ waning mental and physical ability, health concerns, stress caused by the prevailing socio-economic crisis, and most importantly, the essential rest needed in their old age. Although some families may have the resources or support systems which make it possible for grandparents to look after grandchildren with less hassle. However, for underprivileged families, especially those with a high age gap between grandparents and grandchildren, these are challenges concerning children’s early development and safety as well as grandparents’ well-being.   Needless to say, in that context, it is important to understand that difficulties pertaining to looking after the children of working parents is a social issue that needs to be addressed through the ongoing social security programmes. May not be the most ideal solution, yet, one possibility is introducing low-cost daycare centres or such services at a concessional rate for children of underprivileged families. This, if done right, being properly regulated with good training and ample resources could be a lifeline for many women to remain in their careers or continue to be a part of the nation’s workforce. Flexible working hours or paid leave programs for both parents would also help ease the hardships faced by low income families.  At the same time, there is a need to provide more support, staff and resources for public officials entrusted with ensuring children’s safety. Another important aspect is for the government to introduce well-resourced programmes to identify children who live in risky situations, and plan careful interventions or support packages to prevent tragedies such as the Mulleriyawa one.

According to subject Minister Kanchana Wijesekera, the electricity tariffs of the domestic category (first 30 units) will be reduced by a minimum of 23%, of the religious places by 7% (consuming 31-60 units) and 23% (consuming zero to 30 units), and of the hotel category by 29-40%.   Presenting the relevant rates in the Parliament yesterday, Wijesekera said that in accordance with the proposed tariff revision, the rate charged per one unit of electricity for the first 30 units in the domestic category, will be reduced by Rs. 5, which will bring the new rate to Rs. 25. The fixed charge for the first 30 units, which is currently Rs. 400, will be reduced by Rs. 150 to Rs. 250. He said that a minimum of 23% relief would be provided to the first category, which he said would benefit 1,744,000 families. He also said that the tariff charged per unit for the units consumed between 31-60 is expected to be reduced by 9%, while the charge for zero-60 units is to be reduced by 7%.   According to him, the electricity tariffs for 15,646 religious places around the country consuming zero-30 units of electricity will be reduced by 23%, while a 7% tariff reduction will be provided for another 10,692 religious places consuming between 31-60 units.   An electricity tariff revision of 29-40% has been proposed for the hotel category.   Wijesekera made the announcement of the relevant rates while the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) has announced that it would announce the new electricity tariffs on 30 June. PUCSL Chairman Janaka Ratnayake said on Tuesday (23) that opinions of the public pertaining to the matter would be considered in the final tariff revision, as per Section 30 of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act and Section 17 of the PUCSL Act.   Ratnayake recently said that electricity consumers should receive an immediate electricity tariff reduction by approximately 20%, given the recent reductions in the electricity demand, foreign exchange rates and fuel prices. The relevant proposal had been submitted to the PUCSL by the CEB on 15 May. Following its submission, Ratnayake said that there is a possibility of reducing electricity tariffs by 27%, but that the CEB had submitted a proposal to reduce the tariffs by only 3%.

Hence, the Jaffna Teaching Hospital, in cooperation with several Government and non-Governmental organisations, has initiated a special programme based on a multi-disciplinary team with the intention of eliminating the drug menace and rehabilitating drug addicts.   According to recent reports, roughly 200 million people worldwide use cannabis, 27 million use amphetamine-type stimulants like “ice” (crystal methamphetamine) and 20 million use cocaine. Among them, 2% have been identified to be Asians. Worldwide alcohol and illicit drug use has also become a leading cause of death, while the increase in drug sales over the dark web has largely increased over the past few years.   When considering the current situation in Sri Lanka, the National Dangerous Drugs Control Board (NDDCB) or the principal national drug control and monitoring authority in Sri Lanka was within the purview of the Ministry of Defence and is now under the Ministry of Public Security. And, the two compulsory drug treatment centres, Kandakadu and Senapura, are managed by the military.   In the Northern Peninsula, the Jaffna Police Division’s Crime Prevention Unit carries out operations every week to apprehend drug peddlers and dealers who target schoolchildren and youths. The Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) of the Jaffna Teaching Hospital provides security institutions, including the Police, with the data collected from patients who visit the hospital with drug-related issues.   According to recent studies, with the use of drugs increasing over the past few years, all forms of crime, including incidents of housebreaking, robbery, theft of property, domestic abuse, and rape, have seen a sharp increase. This programme, which is aimed at eliminating such crimes, particularly by eliminating the drug menace, uses an evidence-based approach by mapping risk factors and pathways, in addition to planning and implementing interventions involving all stakeholders.      Recently collected analytical data show that most drug addicts in the Northern Province are heroin users, followed by those who use crystal methamphetamine and Kerala cannabis. Some have been identified to use multiple drugs and with less health-seeking behaviour (any action undertaken by individuals who perceive themselves to have a health problem or to be ill for the purpose of finding an appropriate remedy).   In the course of last year (2022) alone, 742 drug addicts, most of whom were aged between 20 and 25 years, had been presented to the JMO of the Jaffna Teaching Hospital. Most of the said individuals have been discovered to be heroin addicts. Incidents of such youths dying in the Jaffna District due to drug overdose and other drug-related sudden illnesses have also been reported, emphasising the need to take appropriate remedial actions at the earliest possible time.   As no rehabilitation centre is located in the vicinity of the Northern and Eastern Provinces, most parents in these provinces are reluctant to send their children to rehabilitation centres in other parts of the country because of the distance, language-related issues, and the lack of motivational changes. Accordingly, counsellors attached to the multi-disciplinary team work towards supporting Tamil-speaking children undergoing rehabilitation at the Fernham Certified School in Atchuvely, which comes under the purview of the Department of Probation and Child Care Services. The Atchuvely Certified School is the only Tamil-medium school in Sri Lanka certified to provide safe custody and skilled observation of children committed to them by courts. The school provides a disciplined environment which will begin the process of rehabilitation of the child at a time they are experiencing an abrupt break from familiar surroundings and enable information gathering for the assistance of the courts. Recreation is essential for physical and mental growth as well as the wellbeing of every individual. Under the guidance of the multi-disciplinary team, this school provides regular medical inspection and remedial action to rectify defects or deficiencies, and, where necessary, psychiatric examination and treatment through the Jaffna Teaching Hospital and the Atchuvely Divisional Hospital.   The multi-disciplinary team, with the help of the Jaffna Magistrate’s Court, has also commenced a mentoring programme for prisoners, where the latter are provided with the opportunity to visit the Jaffna Teaching Hospital for weekly psychiatric clinics. The most important criterion of this procedure is that each person attending the psychiatric clinic has to be followed up each week, and a report be sent to the Jaffna Magistrate once a month. This has helped to reduce the number of drug peddlers in the Jaffna District.   Additionally, the multi-disciplinary team is launching other forms of mentoring programmes as well for those imprisoned over drug-related charges. These programmes are conducted by the relevant community physician who visits prisons with their team on a weekly basis. Under this programme, the unemployed in the area are provided with job opportunities. Plans are underway to implement female empowerment programmes that would ensure the wellbeing of wives and mothers of drug-addicted prisoners and enhance their mental and economical strength.

BY The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) and Justice Rohini Marasinghe,https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/the-morning-39270.appspot.com/o/articles%2F0CWmZSvR4HLFJP5AjyMx?alt=media&token=26cb1fc4-17b7-4236-a37e-c4909dfe17c5,The ICCPR’s Human Rights Committee’s 137th session: HRCSL opening statement on the review of SL’s sixth periodic report,focus," Sri Lanka ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) in 1980 and the first Optional Protocol subsequently. The ratification of the Optional Protocol was not explicitly approved by the Parliament and is not therefore legally binding. However, the provisions relating to Fundamental Rights (FR) were already included in the 1978 Constitution and thereby guaranteed and made justiciable, while other provisions in the ICCPR were incorporated in Statutes, such as the ICCPR Act, No. 56 of 2007. So, we can safely state that provisions contained in the ICCPR are part of the law of Sri Lanka.   There have been many positive steps taken by the Government in ensuring the civil and political rights of the people in the country.   Sri Lanka suffered a civil war for 30 years which ended in 2009. The commitment of the Government to promote reconciliation among victims of the armed conflict on the basis that both parties have committed atrocities and it is time to move forward, led to the establishment of several internal mechanisms as a means of transitional justice. These mechanisms mainly targeted the issues during the armed conflict and ensured non-occurrence. The Government co-sponsored two Resolutions before the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council (HRC) in 2015 and 2017. These resolutions primarily endorse the commitment of the Government to transitional justice mechanisms.   For that, the Government enacted Legislation relating to transitional justice mechanisms such as the Office on Missing Persons (Establishment, Administration and Discharge of Functions) Act, No. 14 of 2016, the Office for Reparations Act, No. 34 of 2018 and the Registration of Deaths (Temporary Provisions) (Amendment) Act, No. 16 of 2016 to issue certificates of absence, the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Act, No. 5 of 2018, and the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act, No. 4 of 2015. It also established the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) to deal with the reconciliation process.   In 2015, the Government established the Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms (SCRM) to ensure that the commitments under the UN HRC Resolution 30/1 are complied with. The function of the SCRM was to facilitate transitional justice mechanisms. It also provided a conduit for the ONUR.       Memorialisation and reconciliation      Memorialisation is an important and integral part of the reconciliation process. The denial of this opportunity will only serve to deepen ethnic divisions and hamper reconciliation efforts. The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) wrote to the President in June 2017 in this regard.    After a 30-year armed conflict, Sri Lanka is attempting to deal with the past and work towards reconciliation. In this process, all communities must have the space and ability to mourn the loss of their loved ones and to remember them. Therefore, memorialisation is a vital and integral part of the reconciliation process. In Sri Lanka, we have built memorials to commemorate the soldiers who have lost their lives during the armed conflict. Likewise, all communities should be provided with the right to commemorate the death of their loved ones appropriately. The fact that they were members of a proscribed group should not be taken as a reason to deny the families the right to mourn and remember them.   The HRCSL recommended that they too be treated equally and provided with a space to remember their loved ones. The Government has now allowed the victims’ families the space to mourn and remember them appropriately.   The strength and efficacy of the HRCSL as a staunch defender of civil and political rights stems from its independent status.   The 19th Amendment to the Constitution provided for the reestablishment of the Constitutional Council (CC) which strengthened the appointment process of independent Commissions including the HRCSL. The HRCSL was accredited with “A” status by the Sub-Committee on Accreditation of the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions in 2018, and it strives to maintain this status to this very day.   The regime changed in 2019, and the CC was replaced by the Parliamentary Council allegedly restricting the Paris Principles for appointments to Commissions, and this primarily resulted in the downgrade of the HRCSL. The circumstances which had arisen for the downgrade at that time have now changed with the implementation of the 21st Amendment to the Constitution and the CC, thus reestablishing compliance with the Paris Principles.   However, whatever the appointment process may be, the mandate of the Commission provides the Commission with independence in the exercise of its functions. The Commission is completely detached from the Executive arm of the Government.   In terms of Section 15(2) of the HRCSL Act, No. 21 of 1996, the Commission has the right to enter any place of detention at any time and issue summons on any person to appear before the Commission. Equipped with this right, the Commission has held inquiries and made recommendations against senior officers of the Police.   The indispensable role of the HRCSL in safeguarding civil and political rights is starkly apparent when considering its participation in the constitutional reform process.   The HRCSL made its submission to the Committee on Law and Order in August 2016. In that report, the Commission emphasised that the public security laws should be aligned with Sri Lanka’s human rights obligations, in particular under Article 4 of the ICCPR which states that “In time of public emergency which threatens the life of the nation and the existence of which is officially proclaimed, the States Parties to the present Covenant may take measures derogating from their obligations under the present Covenant to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, provided that such measures are not inconsistent with their other obligations under international law and do not involve discrimination solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin”.   In that statement, the HRCSL emphasised that predominantly, public security laws should be to protect the people and their democratic rights. Sections 2 and 5 of the Public Security Ordinance and Section 12 entrust the power to the Head of State to make regulations for public security and to promulgate a state of emergency. The HRCSL recommended the review of the said Ordinance to reform the legislative regime applicable to public security.   The HRCSL has submitted the draft Charter of Rights (2009) to be included in the Constitution which refers to a list of rights.   The HRCSL submitted the proposals for constitutional reforms to the Public Representations Committee in 2016.   The statement of the Commission encapsulated the view that an emergency should be imminent and lifted as soon as the danger to the public has ceased.    The HRCSL further emphasises the need to incorporate economic, social, and cultural rights in the future Constitution. The HRCSL informed the Sub Committee on FR of its position on the reform of Article 16 of the 1978 Constitution. It was stated that the “HRCSL is of the view that the future Constitution must recognise the principle of the supremacy of the Constitution. All written and customary laws will be invalid to the extent of their inconsistency with the Constitution.”   The Government has attempted to address this issue by establishing many commissions. It is a very sensitive matter as it involves specific ethnic, religious and personal laws of the people.   The freedom of information has been added to the FR Chapter, making it a judicially enforceable right.      Death penalty       The HRCSL is also firm in the belief that the right to life should be enshrined as a FR in the Constitution, although it is accepted as a right by judicial precedence.   In 2016, the HRCSL also recommended ratifying the ICCPR Second Optional Protocol which calls for the abolition of the death penalty. The abolition of the death penalty is in keeping with Sri Lanka’s commitment to a more humane society consonant with human rights principles and values. Although the death penalty has not been implemented in Sri Lanka since 1976, it remains an enforceable punishment in the statute books so much so that in 2015, the Head of State imported the ropes and advertised for the post of the executioner. The complete erasure of the death penalty from the statutes remains a political issue today. Article 13(4) of the Constitution acknowledges the death penalty as a legal punishment.      The HRCSL stands firm against discrimination and violence against women      Recognising that the prevention of sexual violence in conflict is critical to building peace and stability in 2016, the Government endorsed the declaration of the commitment to end sexual violence in conflict. It also reiterated the commitment to ending impunity for such crimes. In October, 2015, the Jaffna High Court (HC) convicted four members of the military for the rape of a woman. Due to the seriousness of the crime, the trial was heard in the HC by three Judges. The conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court (SC).   The HRCSL further states that the Commission has already informed the public that any violence or discrimination against women must be brought to the notice of the Commission immediately.   The Commission in 2016, prepared a list of constitutional reforms and submitted it to the Prime Minister, the Speaker of Parliament, and the Public Representations Committee. The proposal included that the State should take steps to amend Article 12(2) of the Constitution to include explicitly the words “gender, sex, and sexual orientation” in the Constitution. However, the Attorney General has informed by way of an opinion that such explicit words may not be needed as the equality clause in Article 12(1) of the Constitution could conveniently deal with the entire issue. “All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of the law.”  (Justice Marasinghe is the Chairperson of the HRCSL and a retired SC Judge)      ",TRUE,3S7hjFYyt1Zgvl15YHH1GEuruUi2,Waruna Prabath,0,Sri Lanka ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) in 1980 and the first Optional Protocol subsequently.

Consumer price index in Colombo rose 35.3% from a year ago, the Statistics Department said in a statement Friday. That compares with a 50.3% rise in March based on a revised index, and Bloomberg’s survey estimate of a 37.8% gain.      The latest reading suggests the Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s efforts to reach single-digit inflation by the end of this year is bearing some fruit. The monetary authority earlier this month held its benchmark rate at a two-decade high to keep Asia’s fastest inflation in check and support economic recovery after the nation secured a $3 billion International Monetary Fund bailout.     The IMF loan is unlocking more funding for the South Asian nation which faced its worst economic crisis since independence with a default in sovereign bonds as well as shortages in dollars and essential items. Improving investor sentiment after the funding has supported the local currency, helping the nation boost imports of food and fuel.     Food prices rose 30.6% in April from a year ago, slower than 47.6% in March, while transport inflation was up 32.3%, significantly lower than 72.7% in the previous month, reflecting impact of cut in fuel prices.      The Sri Lankan rupee has strengthened from its record low in May to emerge as the world’s best-performing currency this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tourism is also helping fuel the recovery.     There are some roadblocks though, particularly with Sri Lanka’s push to expedite a debt restructuring plan that would be crucial to unlock funds under the IMF program.     In the latest setback, the government has pushed back the release of its debt overhaul plan to the middle of May. It is seeking to avoid talks that include pre-conditions amid demands from its foreign bondholders and reluctance from some local banks to participate in the restructuring, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said on Wednesday.

However, contrary to social media posts seen circulating in the past week, Police Spokesperson SSP Nihal Thalduwa yesterday (10) stated that the deaths of seven horses reported from the Police Mounted Division were not related to lack of food, but were from other causes.    This, as experts warned that several more horses that were at the division were in a critical condition and that the underlying issues for the deaths were linked to malnutrition.    Speaking to  The Sunday Morning,   SSP Thalduwa said that keeping in mind a horse’s life span, the recorded seven deaths for this year were not out of the ordinary, as horses were delicate animals.    “Annually there are horse deaths recorded as the animal’s life expectancy is 15 years. In certain years, there were more deaths reported. Since these are imported breeds, they die due to various reasons such as weather, food, etc.    “According to the JMO report, only one death was due to food-related issues. The other six deaths were due to other diseases. We have not considered conducting further inquiries into these deaths as it will be a long and expensive process,” he said.    Additionally, he said that with the current economic conditions, sourcing animal feed had been difficult as horse feed was imported but could not be stored in large quantities due to risk of expiration. Contradicting the Police Spokesperson’s statement, Peradeniya University Department of Farm Animal Production and Health Senior Lecturer and Large Animal Teaching Hospital Senior Physician Dr. Dhammika Perera told  The Sunday Morning   that the lack of animal feed was a significant issue affecting horse owners.    “Due to the dollar issue, suppliers who were awarded tenders have not supplied the feed to stables. Feed is mainly imported from Australia and because of the delay in shipments, the feed has had to be rationed. The cause of death for these animals may not be food-related, but the underlying cause is malnutrition. The cause of death may be other diseases such as pneumonia, which occurs due to lower immunity resulting from malnutrition.” Dr. Perera also stated that the seven horse deaths could not be attributed to old age, overwork, or lack of care.    He added: “We were only consulted two weeks ago and having analysed the JMO reports, in-house veterinary surgeon’s reports, and other details, we have taken immediate steps to assist the Mounted Division by preparing the necessary diet plans and nutrition supplements, conducting training programmes for the stable hands, etc. At present, the Police Mounted Division has around 40 horses in stables in Colombo, Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, and Kalutara, out of which two to four horses are in critical condition.”    He also stated that another key issue was that there was only one veterinary surgeon who had to oversee not only the four stables of the Mounted Division, but also the Police K9 Division.    Meanwhile, speaking to The Sunday Morning,   an equestrian expert who wished to remain anonymous stated that horse feed prices had increased threefold and the local variety in the market was of low quality.    “Imported feed, especially oats, cannot be found anywhere now. The brand currently available in the local market is a monopoly and is not of the best quality. According to my knowledge, the budgetary provisions have been cut by more than half so they cannot afford the best feed brands. Since stable hands and riders cannot starve the animals, they opt for alternative food such as cattle feed, which may contain urea that horses cannot digest. With horses being delicate animals, even a small change in the diet or exercise schedule can cause colic, which is the most common health issue in horses.”    Responding to The Sunday Morning,   Public Security Minister Tiran Alles stated that while he had called for a detailed report on the seven horse deaths of the Police Mounted Division, which he would receive by Monday (12), he did not want to make a statement on the matter as the investigations were still ongoing.

Accordingly, under the instructions of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation Minister, Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) has been tasked with the reconstruction of the Pier. The estimated cost of the investment is Rs. 1,800 million. Parallel to the reconstruction of the Pier, about 10 acres of government-owned land bordering the port will be acquired for port infrastructure development activities. Under these new developments, a modern passenger terminal and warehouse facilities will also be constructed.    To make initial plans for the project and to carry out the necessary inspections, Minister de Silva made a special visit to the port on 4 August. He further attended a special discussion held to discuss and resolve issues pertaining to the project. Speaking at the event, the Minister said that the reconstructions will reawaken the strong relationship between the two neighbouring nations. He emphasised that the commencement of the ferry service between Talaimannar and Rameswaram will further facilitate Sri Lankan pilgrims planning to go to India, by providing low-cost travel facilities. He also said that these measures will facilitate the exchange of goods between the two countries and will be a commendable opportunity to popularise the products of the people of northern Sri Lanka in India.    In the past, a passenger ferry service existed between Talaimannar, Sri Lanka, and Danushukodi, India. However, the Dhanuskodi Port was completely destroyed due to cyclones. At present, India has completed the development activities of the Rameswaram Port, and the Indian government has provided clearance to commence a passenger ferry service between Mannar and Rameswaram.

Ali Sabry, on Monday (25), reacting to the India-Canada diplomatic row, said that terrorists have found safe haven in Canada and that their Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has come out with “outrageous” allegations without any proof.   Speaking exclusively to   Asian News International (ANI)  , Ali Sabry said that he is “not surprised” by Trudeau’s remarks since the Canadian Prime Minister keeps making “outrageous and unsubstantiated allegations.” “Some of the terrorists have found safe haven in Canada. The Canadian Prime Minister has this way of just coming out with some outrageous allegations without any supporting proof. They did the same thing for Sri Lanka – a terrible, total lie about saying that Sri Lanka had a genocide. Everybody knows that there was no genocide in our country,” he said.   India-Canada ties hit a new low after Trudeau, on 18 September, alleged India’s involvement in the fatal shooting of Khalistan Tiger Force Chief Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada. Nijjar, a designated terrorist in India, was killed outside a gurdwara (a Sikh place of assembly and worship) in Canada’s Surrey on 18 June. India had rejected the allegations as “absurd and motivated”.   Taking a dig at Trudeau for honouring a former Nazi soldier in Canada’s Parliament, he said: “I saw yesterday that he had gone and given a rousing welcome to somebody who has associated with the Nazis in the past during the Second World War. So, this is questionable and we have dealt with it in the past. I am not surprised that sometimes Prime Minister Trudeau comes out with outrageous and unsubstantiated allegations.”   On 22 September, during Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s speech in the Canadian Parliament, 98-year-old Ukrainian Yaroslav Hunka, who served in the first Ukrainian division, also known as the Schutzstaffel (SS – Protective Echelon) Division “Galicia” during World War II, was honoured by the Speaker of Canada’s House of Commons.   Ali Sabry said that Trudeau’s “genocide” comment had affected Sri Lanka-Canada ties. “That has actually affected our relationship. The Foreign Affairs Ministry has a different take on that. The Ministry of Global Affairs has very clearly said that Sri Lanka did not go through a genocide, whereas Prime Minister Trudeau, as a politician, stands up and says that genocide had taken place. That itself is contradictory to each other. That doesn’t help,” said Ali Sabry.   He also advised the Canadian Prime Minister not to interfere in the internal matters of a sovereign country. “I don’t think that anyone should poke their nose into other countries and tell as to how we should govern our country. We love our country more than anyone else. That’s why we are in our country. We are not very happy about that statement at all. The Indian Ocean identity is very important and we need to strengthen the regional architecture. We have to look after our region. We need to work together. That’s how we can create a peaceful environment. We should not be dictated to by anyone else as to how we should conduct our affairs,” he added.   Sri Lanka had earlier rejected Trudeau’s statement containing “outrageous claims” of genocide relating to the past conflict in Sri Lanka.   The Sri Lankan Foreign Affairs Ministry said that such irresponsible and polarising pronouncements by the leader of a nation breeds disharmony and hatred both in Canada and Sri Lanka instead of promoting peace and reconciliation.

They made a few changes to their lineup allowing Kavin Bandara to open the batting alongside Minod Bhanuka. Bandara grabbed the opportunity with both hands, stoking a quick-fire 27 at the top.    The rest of the batters chipped in with cameos, while in-form Ashen Bandara top-scored with 37 runs.

According to the UN agency, 15% of working-age women globally would like to work but do not have a job, compared with 10.5% of men, whereas unemployment levels are very similar for both sexes, “because the criteria used to define unemployment tend to disproportionately exclude women”.   Held back   Personal and family responsibilities, including unpaid care-related work are among the reasons why women are disproportionately affected in the search for work.   “These activities can prevent them not only from being employed but also from actively searching for employment or being available to work at short notice,” the ILO said, adding that these requirements are a prerequisite for unemployment registration.   Highlighting how the jobs gender gap has remained almost unchanged between 2005 and 2022, the ILO pointed out that women continue to be overrepresented in many vulnerable sectors, such as running their households or working for relatives, rather than for themselves.   “This vulnerability, together with lower employment rates, takes a toll on women’s earnings,” the UN agency said. “Globally, for each dollar of labour income men earn, women earn only 51 cents.”   Male pay bias   Significant differences exist between regions, with low and lower-middle income countries seeing far worse gender disparity in income, with women earning 33 cents and 29 cents on the dollar, respectively.   In high-income and upper-middle income countries, women’s relative labour income reaches 58 and 56 cents respectively per dollar earned by men.   “Gender imbalances in access to employment and working conditions are greater than previously thought, particularly in the developing world…the pace of progress is disappointingly slow,” said the ILO.   According to the UN labour agency, the global unemployment rate stood at 5.8% in 2022, below the average rates in the two decades before the pandemic, and it is projected to remain at that level in 2023.

The meeting took place days after 38 Sri Lankans were repatriated by the authorities of the Réunion Island of France on January 25 after an illegal migration attempt via sea routes was foiled on 14 January.   The smugglers, identified as residents of Kalpitiya and Kandy, are believed to have charged sums ranging from Rs. 400,000 to Rs. 1 million per person, Sri Lanka Navy reported.   Meanwhile, another group of illegal migrants, which comprised 46 Sri Lankans, were repatriated by French authorities on January 13 after an unsuccessful illegal migration attempt.   Meanwhile, a court in northern France sentenced 14 Sri Lankan nationals to prison for operating a people-smuggling ring across Europe as part of a continent-wide attempt to crack down on the lucrative criminal networks.   According to the UK Government figures, more than 45,000 migrants have made the perilous crossing from mainland Europe to Britain in 2022, surpassing the previous year’s record by more than 17,000.

The ECA has organised a protest march from Divulapitiya to the Ministry of Power and Energy in Colombo today (1 November) in protest of the recent increase in electricity tariffs.   Speaking to   The Daily Morning   yesterday (31 October), ECA General Secretary Sanjeewa Dhammika said that they had, as per the provisions of the Police Ordinance, informed the IGP of their plans to hold the protest march through a letter dated Monday (30 October). ""We have seen the Police working to stop various protests, claiming that the organisers had not informed the Police regarding them in advance. In order to prevent such inconvenience, we have informed IGP Wickramaratne in writing, and sent the copies of that letter to officers in charge of all relevant Police stations."" However, he claimed that the Divulapitiya Police was attempting to sabotage their protest march by forcing certain individuals to oppose it. ""Two Police officers had come and asked some three-wheeler drivers to oppose our protest and to go and lodge Police complaints against it, but they had refused to do so. The Police had then got a few persons to sign some blank papers. We have also come to know that they are now trying to get residents near the main road to oppose the protest march, saying that a possible tear gas attack will be hazardous. We have informed the IGP of this matter in writing.""   Police Media Spokesman, Senior Superintendent of Police and attorney-at-law Nihal Thalduwa was not available for comment.  On 18 October, the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) held a public consultation on the then proposed electricity tariff revision in Colombo, to gather ideas and suggestions of around 30 parties – including members of the public and Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) officials – before deciding on green-lighting the CEB's request to increase electricity tariffs. Two days later, on 20 October, the PUCSL granted its approval for the 18% tariff hike, a move that has attracted opposition from several parties including the general public.  The ECA has organised a protest march from Divulapitiya to the Ministry against the tariff hike. It will commence from near the Divulapitiya bus stand, and pass through several areas including Minuwangoda, Ja-Ela, Kandana, Wattala, and Maradana, and reach the Ministry by 10 p.m. today. The ECA further stated that they are considering initiating legal action against the tariff hike before the Supreme Court.

The Police Special Task Force (STF) stated that the arrested male suspect is an active serving member of the Sri Lanka Navy.   Wanted criminal “Booru Moona”, who is said to be involved in 13 murders including killing the owner of a shop in Hanwella on 18 December 2022, had arrived at Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake on 24 February to board a flight to Dubai using a forged passport.   At that time, the suspect was arrested by the airport police on account of receiving information from immigration officials.   Later, three Buddhist monks had arrived at the airport police station to inquire about “Booru Muna” who was under arrest, and in the meantime, the latter had managed to flee in a car.   However, at the time of his arrest, the suspect had confessed that after the murder of the shop owner in Hanwella, he was hiding in a house located on Malwatta Road in Millaniya, Bandaragama.   Accordingly, the Police launched an investigation and it was revealed that the married couple living in the said house that had sheltered “Booru Muna” had also fled the area.   Later, the duo was arrested in Nuwara Eliya on Sunday (5), following extensive investigations.   Police have uncovered that the 35-year-old arrested male suspect is actively serving in the Sri Lanka Navy and that he has not reported to duty following the relevant incident.

Finally, it was decided not to approve the service extension.""  Despite the approval not having been granted by the CC, it was reported that President Wickremesinghe, who is currently out of the country, had reappointed Wickramaratne as the IGP. While on a four-day official visit to China, the President has reportedly given instructions to the relevant higher-ups from Beijing to make the necessary arrangements to reappoint Wickramaratne as the IGP for a period of three weeks.

Who drafted the clauses? What is the sudden rush to make Sri Lanka’s monetary arm ‘independent’? Who included ‘The Central Bank shall be autonomous and accountable as provided for in this act’? Accountable to whom?    Who included ‘The autonomy of the Central Bank shall be respected at all times and no person or entity shall cause any influence on the Governor of the Central Bank or other members of the Governing Board and Monetary Policy Board or employees of the Central Bank in the exercise, performance and discharge of their powers, duties, and functions under this act or interfere with the activities of the Central Bank’ (Clause 5.3)? Is the clause implying that even Sri Lanka’s Judiciary cannot take action against the Central Bank and its members?    So long as the Sri Lankan citizens are paying the salaries of the Central Bank and so long as sovereignty is inalienable and with the people of Sri Lanka as vested in the Constitution of Sri Lanka, the Central Bank is no supra body and the Governor is certainly not above the President of Sri Lanka to be immune from any accountability.    It is, therefore, imperative to know who drafted the clauses in this bill presented to Sri Lanka’s Parliament, for obviously none inside Parliament have read a word to realise the gravity of the clauses.      No country is truly independent      No country is today truly independent – every nation is interdependent. When taking loans, countries have to abide by pre-conditions even though they have to pay the loan as well as the interest. When trading, there are conditions laid out which countries have to fulfil. Nothing happens in black and white and nothing can be judged in black and white either.   In July 2020, the US antitrust subcommittee heard testimonies of CEOs from Amazon, Apple, Facebook (FB), and Google accused of abusing their position and invading user privacy via their surveillance networks. It showed there was nothing much the US Government could do or would do and in fact, Government intel operatives ended up seeking help from the tech firms for various espionage work. ‘Independence’ was a mere word.   Cambridge Analytica/Facebook also showed how personal data is compromised without consent. Some 87 million FB users were compromised using the ‘This is Your Digital Life’ app from which psychological profiles were built and the data was used for political campaigns. Again, we are told these platforms are ‘independent,’ but they are not.   Even the UN is heavily influenced by powerful nations. Though we are made to believe all countries have one vote, that five countries have veto power shows an imbalance, that 500 years of colonial crimes have never been accounted for while the perpetrators of these crimes are today the ‘watchdogs’ for human rights and freedoms, highlights the hypocrisies that prevail.      Sri Lanka’s Central Bank      Politics to technology, economics/trade, military/weapons industry to cultural hegemony, where national cultures and traditions are being unfairly diluted with bizarre values and practices via numerous political programmes that nations have to agree to, highlight there is no independence for countries today.   If you have understood this, you will then understand the issue or at least question why the Central Bank of Sri Lanka wishes to be ‘independent’ and why its Governor and the Central Bank should gain immunity that even the President of Sri Lanka does not have. How can the Governor and the Central Bank, enjoying salaries paid by the taxpayers of Sri Lanka, claim not to be answerable to them?   Who tabled the bill aiming to repeal the existing Monetary Law Act? Susil Premajayantha. Has he read the clauses of this act before tabling it?   The Central Bank is just another entity within the State of Sri Lanka. If one entity seeks to be ‘autonomous,’ does it imply all other statutory bodies within the State of Sri Lanka are next in line to be made ‘autonomous’? What will happen to the State of Sri Lanka when all State entities claim to be above the law and not answerable to the State of Sri Lanka, including the citizens?      Power with the people      The Constitution of Sri Lanka clearly bestows powers of sovereignty with the people. The people delegate their powers to the three pillars that are elected by an election for a term of office. The policies of the Executive, Legislature, and Judiciary are delegated by the people to these three branches.    The Parliament holds legislative powers that are delegated by the people. The Cabinet – together with the President – carries out Executive functions. The Central Bank Clause 5.4 therefore cannot be dislocated from this delegated power without seeking the mandate of the people by simply getting a Member of Parliament to present a bill.    Article 148 of Sri Lanka’s Constitution gives parliamentary control of public finance. The Central Bank cannot control public finance without being overlooked or held accountable.   The ironical aspect of the bill is that while Clause 5.3 seeks to be immune from Sri Lankan accountability, Clause 85 claims the Central Bank can function “under the advice of international bodies”. The Central Bank wants to be ‘independent’ of the State of Sri Lanka but take advice from international bodies!      Sri Lanka’s economic policy      The nation’s economic policy encompasses many areas that cannot be ignored and disassociated or delinked. The economic policy of Sri Lanka is simply not ‘monetary policy,’ as the pushers of the Central Bank Bill are attempting to do.    Moreover, the fiscal policy under the purview of the Legislature requires the CBSL to function as administrators of Government borrowing. Therefore, the CBSL cannot be ‘autonomous’ in this role.    The CBSL has to understand that fiscal policy and monetary policy go hand in hand and cannot function as a separate and ‘autonomous, independent’ body in a sovereign state. Attempts to dislodge and delink the two is only an insidious attempt to further economically and socially collapse Sri Lanka for geopolitical agendas.      What’s the agenda?      What was the purpose of granting unilateral powers to the CBSL to make monetary policy immune from the State apparatus? If the CBSL wishes not to listen to or act with other players within the State, would the State apparatus also listen to the CBSL? If such a scenario arises, what good does it bring Sri Lanka and its citizens?   Why is the CBSL senior management silent regarding these dangers? Surely they must understand the greater dangers at play? Why do they want to take advice only from international players and be autonomous from the State of Sri Lanka?   The bill is like most foreign-infused drafts that fall short of study and have been hurriedly pushed and peddled for international political gains. While the CBSL wishes to be autonomous, there are clauses like 26(1) requiring the minister to sign an ‘inflation targeting agreement’ though the minister has no powers except to simply sign on a dotted line as per CBSL instructions. Since when did elected representatives take orders from officials paid by the taxpayers?   The CBSL Bill puts elected representatives in the role of peons as seen in Clause 28; there, the CBSL simply ‘informs’ the minister through reports about the policies the CBSL has adopted. Then, Clause 84 of the bill states that the CBSL can “advise” the Government but there is no provision for the Government to instruct or advise the CBSL.    Moreover, Clause 10(1)(13) read with Clause 7(1) allowing CBSL to “determine” and “implement” without directive of the Legislature and Executive is tantamount to usurping the sovereignty of Sri Lanka.   Why should the CBSL and a bunch of taxpayer-paid officials become more powerful than all of the three pillars of governance?      Neither independent nor autonomous      The manner in which the bigwigs of the CBSL have been listening to international monetary agencies and even foreign governments in its policy decisions over and above the advice given by the Government shows that the CBSL can never be ‘independent’ and ‘autonomous’.   In fact, the bill is seeking to simply break the existing link to the Government and the State of Sri Lanka and have the CBSL function as a foreign-guided monetary policy arm. The case of the Latvian Governor of the Central Bank is important to understand the dangers at play.   In recent weeks the news covered Sri Lanka’s Foreign Minister, unelected and entering through the backdoor National List seat, proudly claiming to use Indian currency in Sri Lanka.    The CBSL Clause 47(2) allows any currency as legal tender for transactions in Sri Lanka. This is a violation of Sri Lanka’s sovereignty as given to the people in the Constitution. How can a team of taxpayer-paid officials decide what currency is used in Sri Lanka without Cabinet or parliamentary approval while the citizens cannot file Fundamental Rights cases against such with the Judiciary?    Undermining matters further is Clause 37, which gives virtual unilateral powers to the CBSL to deal with Sri Lanka’s foreign exchange policy with absolutely no involvement of the Parliament or the Cabinet.      A matter of mischief      CBSL cannot be a part of Sri Lanka yet by operation not be part of Sri Lanka while making decisions on Sri Lanka without the involvement of the Legislature and the Executive and being immune to the Judiciary.   While seeking to be ‘autonomous,’ the CBSL desires to be the supra body above the three pillars that the people of Sri Lanka have delegated their sovereign powers to. The CBSL is only a small yet important entity within the State of Sri Lanka; it cannot attempt to disassociate itself yet function as ‘Executive’ when the Executive and Legislature are democratically elected.   However, whoever drafted the bill is attempting to do some mischief while the CBSL senior staff are faulted for not highlighting the inconsistencies of the bill, for they should know the dangers and the ramifications of the bill to Sri Lanka if they were patriotic enough to understand.

There is a letter that is being circulated, sent by the Puttalam Grand Mosque to Parliamentarian Ali Sabri Raheem expressing disapproval of his appointment, stating that their nominee has not been appointed, and therefore asking him to intervene and review this appointment. The letter also reverts to ‘regionalism’ to mention that the Quazi in question is not from Puttalam,” the statement claimed.   The Network noted that should there be any concern or complaints about the manner in which a Quazi is functioning or regarding his conduct, they should be taken up with the JSC.    “  This latest assault of a Quazi reiterates the urgent need to reform the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act to be fully on par with the Fundamental Rights Chapter of the Constitution. We stress the urgent need to reform the Quazi system as a part of the country’s regular administration of the justice system, thus ensuring the independence of Quazis in all parts of the country within the mainstream justice system. The JSC which is vested with appointment and disciplinary authority over Quazis and the Ministry of Justice should treat this as an urgent matter and provide protection to all Quazis.”         ",TRUE,3S7hjFYyt1Zgvl15YHH1GEuruUi2,Waruna Prabath,0,The Women’s Action Network has condemned the alleged assault on the Puttalam Quazi Dr. Mohamed Rahmathulla Mohamed on 26 March,,0,1680115509,791000000,0HguN5a090dJbEaX82yT,,The Women's Action Network has condemned the alleged assault on Puttalam Quazi Dr. Mohamed Rahmathulla Mohamed on 26 March.

These are the requirements of the political parties. But, our role in the EC is to consider a suitable date for the election.

She is a former player of the Celtics, the club that won the Scottish Women’s Premier League title this year. Galabadaarachchi is also an Australian professional footballer who previously played as a forward for the Australian under-20 national team. Before moving to Celtic, she played as a forward for Melbourne City, Perth Glory, West Ham United, and Napoli. Many believe that she is the most valuable female athlete of Sri Lankan origin.     The Daily Morning Sports   was fortunate enough to have a chat with her during her recent trip to Sri Lanka.        Below are excerpts from the conversation.       Is this your first visit to Sri Lanka?   No, I first came here when I was little. I think this is the fifth or sixth visit. My father’s family members are here, so we would visit often; but this time we are visiting after a lapse of about five years.      Is your father from Kalutara?   Yes, Kalutara. I like my father’s relatives. I like their characters and the food they prepare. A few days in the environment there and the sea give me a very different experience from my usual routine. My father’s parents are there, and it is always a great pleasure to meet them after a long time. They love me so much and treat me well.      Do they know you are a football player?   Yes, but they don’t know much. They think playing this game is crazy, and a woman playing this game is crazier. But they are very proud of me.      How did you get into football?   I started playing football after watching my brother play. I have been watching him play since he was about eight years old; that’s how I got into the game.      If you weren’t a footballer who would you have become?   It is a difficult question. I wanted to be a professional football player ever since I was five years old. But I also love animals and studying them in general. Maybe if I weren’t a soccer player, I’d be a vet or a lawyer.      Who is your favourite football player?   Definitely Messi. I like Lionel Messi and (Diego) Maradona too. But I love Lionel Messi the most.      And your favourite female football player?   I love Marta da Silva from Brazil. Her style of play and competitiveness are very attractive.      Have you ever met Messi in person?   No, I have not met him. But I have watched a few matches he played.      You started your career as a young player in Australia and then made it to the professional/international level. You were drawn to European football. What are the main contrasts in the way the game is played in the two regions?   Football is generally not very popular in Australia. Footy (or AFL) is popular in Australia. Football is still developing in Australia, especially women’s football. European football is at a slightly higher level. The “Matildas” (Australian National women’s football team) are progressing well now.       Have you heard of football in Sri Lanka?      I know there are football fans in Sri Lanka. And even though my father didn’t play football, he used to watch Maradona when he played. It is unfortunate that there is a ban on the current football association in Sri Lanka.      Do you watch cricket?   No, but my father watches cricket like crazy. He never misses Sri Lanka’s matches.      Do you know any Sri Lankan cricketers?   Sangakkara – Kumar Sangakkara is the only name I know.      You are the most valuable player of Sri Lankan origin that we have. Were you aware of it?   No, I actually didn’t know about it. But when I went to Kalutara, one of my relatives and uncles showed me a newspaper article; that’s when I came to know that Sri Lanka was paying attention to me. I initially didn’t think so because I am outside Sri Lanka, but I now feel that they are watching over me.      Do you like your last name?   “Galabadaarachchi” – yes, I like my name very much. The name is a bit long, but I like it a lot. Most commentators find it hard to pronounce. And there is not even a little space left above my jersey number. Most often, the name “Gala” is used.      How is your vacation going?   It has been great. I asked my father to bring me here; so, it has been a very happy time.      What are your favourite Sri Lankan dishes?   Dhal curry, roti, and pappadam are my favourites.      What are your favourite places to visit?   I love to walk on the beaches of Kalutara and Galle in Sri Lanka.      Social media continued to report that you shifted to Europe with the intention of playing for Argentina. Is there any truth to it?   I played in Australia’s age group national teams. After that, I got a little less opportunity there. With that, I came to Europe. Both my favourite player and my mother come from Argentina. So, I would like to play for Argentina and I want to work towards it.       You recently won a couple of awards. What were they?   I never thought I would win these awards, but I was nominated on several occasions. I won the Women’s Young Player of the Year award, given by the Professional Footballers’ Association (PFA) of Scotland, and the Celtic Female Footballer of the Year award.      Can you tell us something about Celtic?   Celtic has been a defining club in my life. Playing for Celtic can be called a turning point in my football career. The audience there is the best I have ever seen.      What is an unforgettable moment in your life?      Talking about football, when I was 17 years old, I left my mother and family to play for West Ham. It was a day I will never forget. It was a turning point in my life.      What is the most memorable match of your life?      I can’t forget playing in the finals and winning for Celtic as well as the first game I played for West Ham. I came in from the bench in that match. I will never forget it.      What is your ultimate goal?    My goal is to score at least one goal for my most beloved club, Barcelona. I became a fan of the club mainly because of Messi. And above all, I would love to someday clinch the Ballon d’Or award. It would mean a lot to me.      Finally, do you have anything to say to the Sri Lankan audience who love you?   Thank you very much to everyone who searched for Galabadaarachchi. Also, if I am here, it is because of the dedication of my mother and father, and I am a part of Sri Lanka because of my father. I love everyone here.

MPs to complain against Mudalige case Addl. Magistrate to JSC,news," Justice Minister to refer the same to JSC if and when MPs’ submissions are received    A group of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Government MPs including Attorney Madhura Withanage are to lodge a complaint with the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), requesting an inquiry against Colombo Additional Magistrate Tharanga Mahawatte – who heard the case pertaining to Inter-University Students’ Federation (IUSF) Convenor Wasantha Mudalige and Inter-University Bhikkhus’ Federation (IUSF) Convenor Ven. Galwewa Siridhamma Thera – based on the affidavits recently submitted to Inspector General of Police (IGP) Chandana D. Wickramaratne by four Terrorism Investigation Division (TID) officers regarding her statements and conduct.   Several SLPP MPs, including Chief Government Whip and Minister Prasanna Ranatunga and MPs Withanage, Attorney Premnath C. Dolawatte, and Samanpriya Herath, requested that necessary action be taken against Additional Magistrate Mahawatte. Minister of Justice, Prisons Affairs, and Constitutional Reforms, President's Counsel (PC) Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe also said yesterday (19) that he would refer the matter to the JSC when the relevant submissions are made to him by the MPs.   Speaking to   The Morning  , Withanage said: “Magistrates cannot make such emotional comments about suspects. If every magistrate acts in such manner, we cannot carry forward the independence of the Judiciary. We will lodge a complaint with the JSC over this matter. The general public does not try to clash with magistrates. We will lodge the complaint along with the hansards of our statements in the Parliament regarding the matter.”   Several SLPP MPs including Withanage also spoke about Additional Magistrate Mahawatte in Parliament yesterday.   “She has admitted in open court that she provided money to a suspect to buy coriander and milk powder. This is also mentioned in the affidavits submitted by the TID officers. If this is to continue, the magistrates in the North and the East will also give money to suspects to buy medicine, saying that they too fought for their lands. This is a big crisis. We need to protect the independence and dignity of the Judiciary. This is just one incident and I saw, with my own eyes, the way the Attanagalla Magistrate behaved in a one-sided and ugly manner regarding the case concerning the death of former MP Amarakeerthi Athukorala,” Withanage claimed in Parliament.   Commenting on the same, Ranatunga said: “We respect the Judiciary, and that it cannot be undermined. We should not talk about the Judiciary too, but these things need to be talked about. We saw that when two suspects related to the ‘aragalaya’ had been presented before the court, the Additional Magistrate had said that she could not help them, as her hands had been tied. She had then given them Rs. 10,000 to purchase some milk powder. The Police officers also submitted affidavits regarding this. When things like this happen, the Judiciary is undermined, just as it was when they undermined court discipline by applauding inside the court during the ‘aragalaya’.”   Dolawatte also commented on the matter, saying: “We know that there are magistrates who are very respectable. We have seen and worked with very decent and respectable magistrates, but I saw that Mahawatte – I don't know how she has worked – had given Rs. 10,000 to a suspect in a case brought before her. Now, the problem here is whether all magistrates are going to help the suspects produced before them in this manner. This is a terrible precedent and a black mark on the entire Judiciary – judges and magistrates. Therefore, Attorney General (AG) Sanjay Rajaratnam PC has now made some intervention. I would like to know from Dr. Rajapakshe PC as to what steps will be taken regarding such behaviour.”   Furthermore, Herath said in Parliament: “A total of 74 houses belonging to MPs, Pradeshiya Sabha (PS) Chairmen, and PS members were burnt down, and MPs’ human rights have been violated. No one talks about these things. Athukorala, the most innocent MP, lost his life. The Additional Magistrate’s statement that the suspects fought for all of us is a serious statement. It is a disgrace to the entire judicial system. If these are not dealt with, it is a travesty, and will create doubt among us MPs and the public about the law.”   “Control over judges' discipline is with the JSC, which is chaired by the Chief Justice (Jayantha Jayasuriya PC). If the MPs can give me the matters that were pointed out today, I will refer it to the JSC and provide answers,” said Dr. Rajapakshe PC, responding to the aforesaid MPs.   The case against Mudalige was initially taken up before Additional Magistrate Mahawatte on 17 January and Senior Deputy Solicitor General (SDSG) Dileepa Peiris appeared for the AG’s Department. Recalling that the relevant case was taken up in the Additional Magistrate's chamber when Mudalige and Siridhamma Thera were produced before court on 17 and 22 November, 2022, SDSG Peiris informed the court that four TID officers had submitted affidavits to IGP Wickramaratne regarding her statements and conduct.    He also informed the court that following the said affidavits being submitted by four TID officers including Senior Superintendent of Police Prasanna de Alwis, Assistant Superintendent of Police Wasantha Ratnayake, and Chief Inspector of Police Kapila Bandara, IGP Wickramaratne has referred the same to the AG's Department, requesting that they be referred to the JSC for a future course of action. The Additional Magistrate had then informed the AG's Department to submit the relevant affidavits to the Court. Accordingly, SDSG Peiris, who submitted the affidavits, requested that the case be transferred to the relevant Chief Magistrate, claiming that it was not appropriate for it to be heard before the said Additional Magistrate.    The SDSG also told the court that the TID officers had stated that Additional Magistrate Mahawatte had given a sum of Rs. 10,000 to Siridhamma Thera to purchase some milk power, and that she had, in doing so, stated: “You all launched the struggle for all of us.”    Additional Magistrate Mahawatte, while noting that she had given the said sum of money to Siridhamma Thera and made such statements before the TID, also said that it was not appropriate to highlight statements that she had not made.    Meanwhile, the Lawyers’ Union of the Colombo Magistrate's Court on Wednesday (18) held a protest outside the AG‘s Department to protest against the AG’s Department’s preparations to submit affidavits submitted by the TID officers regarding Mahawatte to the JSC.    Speaking during the protest, Attorney Gunarathna Wanninayake said: “We must say that if the AG’s Department gets its hands on this Additional Magistrate, that will be the end of the AG’s Department. What she has done is to offer some requisites to the monk (a reference to Siridhamma Thera). The attempt to transfer the case of Mudalige was made on that allegation. The AG's Department has intimidated the Additional Magistrate by showing the affidavits of the TID officers. All magistrates and judges are good judges. They do not take bribes. As such a person who administers justice, we will not allow her (Mahawatte) to be hunted. We also ask CJ Jayasuriya PC to consider this impartially. We have started this fight for the independence of magistrates and judges.”     ",TRUE,3S7hjFYyt1Zgvl15YHH1GEuruUi2,Waruna  Prabath,0,"A group of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Government MPs including Attorney Madhura Withanage are to lodge a complaint with the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), requesting an inquiry against Colombo Additional Magistrate Tharanga Mahawatte",,0,1674155542,31000000,0ILr7AKA6yPT2KgDnMf1,,"Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Government MPs, including Attorney Madhura Withanage, are planning to lodge a complaint with the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) regarding Colombo Additional Magistrate Tharanga Mahawatte.

The shortage of medicines at Colombo’s leading State hospital for kidney transplants, which poses a challenge for ongoing transplant surgeries due to dwindling stocks of the immunosuppressive drug basiliximab, has been temporarily addressed, with emergency purchases from the Ministry of Health (MOH) expected to reach the hospital within a month’s time.   A senior medical specialist attached to the hospital told   The Sunday Morning   that basiliximab had been out of stock for nearly two months, causing the hospital to turn to donors and borrow from other hospitals to continue planned procedures.   The specialist did not want to be named following the gag order issued by the Ministry of Health – a move which has drawn much criticism.   According to the senior medical specialist, the hospital can now proceed with planned transplant surgeries, for which there is a long waiting list, with borrowed drugs.    “We have managed to acquire 25-30 vials of the immunosuppressive drug. We need about 4-8 per transplant surgery, per person, so we have enough for two to three weeks. We hope the stocks will be replenished by then,” the medical specialist said.   “However, kidney treatment still faces challenges from the ongoing national drug shortage. There is a shortage of medical consumables, suture material, and equipment used for surgery,” the senior medical specialist added.   Meanwhile, dental surgeries and dental services at Outpatient Departments (OPDs) continue to be impacted, with nearly 233 medicines related to dental treatment and surgery in short supply.    Speaking to   The Sunday Morning  , Government Dental Surgeons’ Association (GDSA) General Secretary Dr. Manjula Herath said that the Ministry of Health had finally taken up the 233 medicines for emergency purchase. However, the medicines will take at least one to two months to arrive after purchases are made.   When contacted, Ministry of Health Additional Secretary Dr. Saman Ratnayake told   The Sunday Morning   that the ministry had initiated an emergency purchase programme to plug the gaps in supply.   “We have called for emergency purchase bids from registered suppliers, which will be finalised this week. Once finalised, we anticipate the stocks, which will be WHO-approved ones, to arrive within one to two months,” Dr. Ratnayake said.   When asked about the measures that had been taken to address the shortage of medicines for kidney patients and dental patients while the stocks were enroute, Ratnayake said that the ministry was working with stakeholders to prioritise and share available stocks more efficiently.    He said that the Ministry of Health had also permitted some specialised medical units to ‘go shopping’ – that is to make direct urgent or emergency purchases as and when required from the market on a priority basis.

This closely contested encounter was worked off at the BOI Grounds in Katunayake on Tuesday (15).     It was an ever so close nail-biting affair at the beautiful venue bordering the Katunayake Airport premises where the lads from Moratuwa had to pull all strings to secure a last gasp victory against the hill capital boys who came in as firm favourites.   Winning the toss, POW skipper Prince Fernando put the Trinitians to bat first and the TCK skipper Dimantha Mahavithana who opened the innings went back to the dressing room pretty early when Oshan Maneesha bowled him out at five runs. Trinity had a rough patch in the early quarters at 46/3. Opener Chaniru Senarathne scored a quick 34 off 46 deliveries. Middle-order batter Viduneth Dhammage rose up to the occasion as he top scored for Trinity with a composed 37 off 72. Mahendra Bharatha added 26 runs. Trinity put up 171 for nine in 50 overs.   For Prince of Wales, Nethul Anuhas was the pick of the bowlers as he struck three for 35 with Oshan Maneesha ably assisting with two for 44.    Chasing a positive target of 172, POW had a surprise coming as they lost three early wickets but Oshan Maneesha (37) and Pasan Cooray (38) put on a gallant mid-order partnership for the 5th wicket to save the day for the Moratuwa side. Skipper Prince Fernando became the hero as he single handedly took his team to victory scoring 26* at a crucial juncture when they were struggling at 132 for eight. Kanilka Anthony has a brilliant spell of three for 24 in a lost cause for TCK.   Exactly a year ago, Trinity were crowned champions in this tourney together with St. Joseph’s when they both settled for a rare photo finish draw at Surrey Village Grounds with the two teams scoring 198 runs each.

To be lonely is not like catching a cold; you do not get infected and feel lonely, you just are. Loneliness cannot be linked to our brain chemistry or its structure just yet, but it is unfair that the feeling is perceived as a dysfunction that one creates. “You can’t be lonely; you’re surrounded by friends and family,” or “If you’re so lonely, why don’t you go out and make some friends?” are things that a lot of us have been told when we expressed how lonely we were. People see the feeling as something that’s only “in your head” or something that you have invented for yourself.       You do not simply have loneliness, you are lonely. Feeling lonely is not something you should feel victimised by, it is simply something that you are. Just because one cannot understand another’s experience does not justify them degrading it. You do not have to be antisocial to be lonely; you could be the life of the party and still feel an alien among others.       Loneliness is a lack of deep bonds with others and a feeling of ‘no one understands me’ – this is not the cliché you see in movies; it is simply something one feels and they do not consider themselves special for it. Loneliness is empty and dry, and a feeling of being trapped in your own mind, unable to reach out to others. It is not an absence of relations, it is the existence of relations that lack emotional connection or those that are non-responsive. This does not go to show that simply being rejected by someone means you are lonely – again, this is victimisation. It is not something that comes up and inconveniences you; it is more something that you’ve always had. Alienation.       Alienation brings about the feeling of homelessness – a sense of never belonging anywhere; mind you, this is not a quirk. Disconnection from others can lead to grief and health challenges that restrict social interaction. Feeling homeless can result from one not feeling respected or valued. Alienation can also bring about the feeling of powerlessness; that is, not feeling like things are out of your control but rather the lack of self-efficacy to create meaningful bonds with others. Society only teaches one what not to do when it comes to making an impression or forming new bonds with others, so they leave lonely individuals high and dry.      There is no cure to being lonely – in fact, it is hard for one to figure out how to not lack the ability to create bonds with others; neither is it something others can ‘fix’. Loneliness concerns the quality of one’s own relations – how others speak to one or fail to do so. Loneliness is complex, and we are yet to understand it vividly.

They further noted that the OMP is just an eyewash, and therefore, urged the OMP to refrain from collecting information regarding them and their missing relatives.   Later, the OMP officers arrived at the place where the protest took place and explained their procedure, noting that it is important to register the details of missing persons and that only then can investigations be carried out.   Speaking to   The Morning  , Secretary to the Association for Relatives of Missing Persons Leeladevi Ananthanadaraja said yesterday that the OMP officers are registering details in regard to missing persons in Mullaitivu and that some family members are uncomfortable sharing such details with the officers.    “They are sending letters to the relatives noting that they are collecting details of the missing. Some of these relatives are confused that they don’t remember where the details of their missing relatives were initially registered. Also, some do not want these OMP officers to record their details. They have a trust issue. Some relatives who have registered with the International Committee for the Red Cross had participated in the OMP sessions. We wanted to highlight to the officers not to misguide and confuse the relatives,” she added.    Meanwhile, an official from the OMP told   The Morning   that there were some members of the Mullaitivu Pradeshiya Sabha protesting along with the relatives of missing persons.    “They are unaware of the proceedings of the OMP. They don’t know the purpose of the meeting and the inquiry. As we explained the procedure, the protestors said that they will hold the protest without blocking the entrance or disturbing those who are coming to testify,” the official said.    The OMP is currently holding inquiries in the Mullaitivu District yesterday and today (20) by inviting 48 families to testify. But the official noted that only a few turned out to testify before the OMP yesterday.    There have been a series of similar protests held by the relatives of missing persons in the same manner, condemning the sittings of the OMP, noting that it is an eyewash.

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss with the Audit firms their role, duties, responsibilities and expectations under the SEC Act when carrying out audits of Market Institutions, Market Intermediaries and Public Listed Companies. About 14 Audit firms attended the meeting, including the 4 big league Audit firms.  SEC Commission Member and President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka Sanjaya Bandara, SEC Director General Chinthaka Mendis, Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) CEO Rajeeva Bandaranaike, Sri Lanka Accounting and Auditing Standards Monitoring Board (SLASSMB) Director General Ms. Anusha Mohotti, as well as Senior officials of the SEC, CSE and SLASSMB were present at the meeting.  At the outset, Salieh said that the new SEC Act classifies Auditors as  “Supplementary Service Providers”  to the SEC and CSE, and that auditors are responsible for verifying and assuring the accuracy of financial reports and overall compliance of listed companies, market institutions and intermediaries through the audit process. He mentioned that this expanded scope of an Auditor’s role would help build the trust and confidence of investors in the capital market.      Drawing attention to the duties of Auditors of Market Institutions, the SEC Chairman explained that Auditors are required to promptly notify the Board Audit Committee and thereafter the Board of Directors through a written report on matters that adversely affect or may adversely affect the financial position of the entity to a material extent; matters that constitute or may constitute a breach of the law, rules or regulatory directives; an offence which involves fraud or dishonesty that affects the financial stability of the entity to a material extent; or an irregularity that has or may have a material effect on the accounts of the entity or that of the funds or property of investors in securities. The Chairman explained that the auditors are also obligated to send a copy of such reports to the SEC as well.     In the same vein, Salieh emphasised the duties of Auditors of Market Intermediaries and their reporting obligation to the SEC. He further explained that the Auditors also have a reporting obligation to the CSE Board in instances where the auditor flags a breach or non-compliance of the Rules of the Market Institution where applicable. The SEC Chairman said that the Auditor should promptly inform the CSE if the auditor is aware of a situation that adversely affects the financial position of a Market Intermediary to a material extent.   Highlighting the duties of Auditors of Public Listed Companies, the SEC Chairman said that  if an auditor becomes aware of a contravention or non-compliance with any law, rule, regulation or regulatory directive issued under the Act; an offence involving fraud or dishonesty; a matter which adversely affects or may affect the financial position of a listed company; an irregularity that has or may have a material effect on the accounts of the company; or an irregularity that jeopardises or may jeopardise the funds or property of investors, then the auditor has a duty by law to promptly report it in writing to the Board Audit Committee of the listed company. He further elaborated that in the event the Board Audit Committee fails to rectify the matter or take action within a period of two weeks, the auditor is required under the Act to inform the Board of Directors. He also added that in the event no action is taken by the Director Board within two weeks, the auditor should promptly red flag it to the SEC.     In the ensuing discussion on the internal control environment of companies, Salieh said: “In order to establish a fair, orderly and transparent capital market it is important that the whole gamut of a company’s governance and risk management structures and processes are rigorously audited.” Therefore, the scope of audit should be enhanced to assess the robustness of a company’s governance framework, policies, procedures and processes in place to mitigate risk and non-compliance including insider dealing, market manipulation, price rigging, etc. by Directors, C-Suite, KMPs and staff. Auditors have a responsible role to play in providing assurances that the internal control environments of entities operating in the capital market meet the required standards of good governance. Companies must move from a compliance box-ticking mode to an active practising mode. “We as a regulator expect auditors to ask searching questions on these matters in the audit assurance process” he emphasised.  He explained that a director of a stock broking company cannot say that he or she was unaware of a market misconduct by its Investment Advisor or employee because the Board of Directors is responsible for institutionalising a robust and efficient governance framework within the entity. Auditors, as the third line of defence, should look into the effectiveness of such frameworks, policies and procedures as part of the audit process. Nor should a director of any company claim unawareness of capital market regulations when engaging in share trading activities.  Commenting on the role of SLASSMB, the SEC Chairman stated that the SEC does not intend to duplicate the work of SLASSMB but to work in tandem with them in analysing the financials of entities. He highlighted the need to red flag market sensitive issues and errors in the financial reports and promptly require companies to rectify the errors and re-publish the financial statements. He requested SLASSMB to share any significant findings from their monitoring activities with the SEC’s Supervision Division in a timely manner.  During the wide-ranging discussion of issues, key elements regarding the duty of auditors in verifying the effectiveness of mechanisms in place to facilitate and protect whistleblowers, the importance of doing business valuations (by the consulting arms of Audit firms) with greater rigour and fairness from an investor protection perspective, the need to develop a list of Approved  Qualified Auditors based on specific and relevant criteria, and the need to build and strengthen capacity within Audit firms were extensively deliberated at the meeting.  Salieh thanked the participants for the engagement, constructive comments and the commitment of the Audit firms to uphold a high degree of professionalism and deliver the expectations of SEC in their role, duties and responsibilities in the audit process. “Corporate failure is not an event but a process. The audit process should verify whether companies have the systems and processes in place to pick up the signs and flag them in a timely manner. Auditors must proactively blow the whistle if they don’t.”, he noted.  The SEC has held further stakeholder engagements with other market players such as Margin Providers, Investment Managers, Managing Companies (Unit Trusts), Trustees, and Custodians with regard to their specific business operations and what is required of them under the SEC Act and related market rules and regulations.

The country is home to more or less 300 manufacturing companies that employ 350 thousand workers, who in turn support an estimated 700 thousand family members.     These companies produce garments for dozens of major international brands based in the US and Europe, including Victoria's Secret, Marks &amp; Spencer, GAP, Tommy Hilfiger and VanHeusen.      Senior manager Nilantha Kaluarachchi, an employee of Export Processing Zone 'A' in Biyagama, explained to AsiaNews that 'several Sri Lankan garment factory owners have not only cut jobs and wages, but also closed down entire facilities without even paying the paltry compensation recommended by the government.     The basic monthly income of many workers struggling with hyperinflation has fallen to around 25 thousand rupees [US]'.     According to the secretary of the Manufacturers' Association, Dhammika Fernando, 'there is a reduction of workers in the factories and some companies have downsized their operations, while companies with 400-500 workers are open four days a week. The workers in these factories have to work 10 hours a day without overdoing it'.     ""At the last meeting of the National Labour Council it was decided to allow a five-day working week for the rest of the year, provided that no one can be employed on Saturdays. But the garment industry wants to get permission for employees to work on Saturdays,' Fernando added.     According to the joint secretary of the Free Trade Zone and General Services Employees' Union, Anton Marcus, 'employers are expecting a series of labour reforms that worry the unions: increasing the number of overtime hours per month from 60 to 75 hours and increasing night shifts for women from 10 to 15 days. This would prevent companies from hiring more workers by making the most of their labour force'.     ""About 50 thousand employees in the garment sector have been laid off, their wages vanished overnight after a rapid currency devaluation, even though their work continues to enrich the country's three major garment factory conglomerates and their important customers, including major international brands,"" Anton pointed out.     Most of the workers are also not paid the minimum 'emergency allowance' of 10 thousand rupees (USD 27), intended to help them overcome the crisis, despite the fact that the current basic wages are heavily devalued. Anton explains that all brands that source in Sri Lanka have been asked to guarantee the monthly payment of the emergency allowance to their supply chain workers.     The operations manager at the Katunayaka Free Trade Zone factory, Dasun Amaranayake, said that 'some factories give their employees extra support, such as a monthly bonus of 500 rupees (.37) or a food parcel if they have never taken a day off. With wage and benefit adjustments, workers receive between 20,000 and 23,500 rupees (-65) monthly. However, this is an insufficient amount considering that, before the economic crisis, employees' wages were barely at subsistence level and were then worth between 0 and 5 per month'.     ""Employees in the garment sector, mostly women, have migrated from their villages to support their families, and are the basis of an industry that accounts for more than 50 per cent of Sri Lanka's total export earnings. Yet they have suffered from all the crises that have hit the country in recent years: during the Covid-19 pandemic, the income from this industry was deemed too important to let the workers shut themselves away, causing mass outbreaks in factories and workers' homes. In the first three months of the pandemic, garment workers lost around 40% of their wages. The government meanwhile is not interested in dialogue between social partners,' Dasun pointed out.

He made these remarks during a media briefing held yesterday (14).   Handunnetti stressed that the aforementioned Act provided lifestyles of luxury for former Presidents and their spouses during an economic crisis when the general public has been asked to tighten their belts. “The sums provided are being increased annually,” he noted.   Detailing the privileges accorded to former Presidents and their spouses, Handunnetti claimed: “This year (2023), the former Presidents’ expenses have been increased. For this year alone, Rs. 92.2 million has been allocated for former Presidents and their spouses.”    “For vehicles for former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, Rs. 1 million was provided in 2022 which has been increased to Rs. 10 million this year. She has been receiving a continuous pension of Rs. 1.17 million. In other expenses, she has received Rs. 3.5 million, whilst Rs. 1 million has been allocated annually for buildings used by her.”   Speaking of the privileges provided to former President and incumbent Government MP Mahinda Rajapaksa, he alleged that a sum of Rs. 2 million allocated in 2022 has been increased to Rs. 10 million. He further noted that Rajapaksa received a pension of Rs. 1.17 million, Rs. 1 million for buildings, and a further Rs. 1.1 million for other expenses. “Apart from this, Rajapaksa, during his tenure as the Prime Minister, just as for the Presidential quarters, obtained Rs. 229 million for the maintenance of the Prime Minister’s Office. He had obtained Rs. 70 million for entertainment expenses and a further Rs. 12 million for local and international entertainment expenses”.   “The spouse of late President Ranasinghe Premadasa, Hema Premadasa, in 2022, had obtained Rs. 800,000 for vehicles and this amount has been increased to Rs. 5 million this year. She receives Rs. 780,000 as her pension. For other expenses, she receives Rs. 1.5 million, which has been increased from Rs. 1.3 million in 2022. For buildings, she received Rs. 1 million. This year, a total of Rs. 8.28 million has been allocated for her.”   Speaking further, Handunnetti claimed that former President and incumbent Opposition MP Maithripala Sirisena received a sum of Rs. 10 million for vehicles this year, which was an increase from Rs. 2 million allocated in 2022. He takes a pension of Rs. 1.17 million. In other expenses, he obtained Rs. 11 million this year over Rs. 10 million for last year. For buildings, he takes Rs. 1 million”.   “Former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has been allocated Rs. 12 million for this year. He receives Rs. 2 million for vehicles, Rs. 1.17 million as a pension, Rs. 10 million in other expenses, and Rs. 1 million for buildings.”   He also added: “Only former President J.R. Jayewardene moved to his home during retirement without moving into Presidential quarters. Apart from him, none of the other Presidents held back from accepting Presidential quarters.   “We believe that none of the former Presidents or their spouses has any financial difficulties in comparison to the general public. They have houses in Colombo; they have properties; and they have children and people to look into their needs. They did not enter politics with nothing. They have money in banks abroad and properties abroad. At a time when the people are suffering, children are dying of hunger, there are no medicines in hospitals, and when all surgical operations apart from urgent surgeries are being stopped in hospitals, they are still enjoying all these privileges. This has to stop. A Government that stops this has to emerge,” Handunnetti further stressed, while adding that the party had therefore already delegated the responsibility of working towards the abolishment of the said Act.   “We come into politics for the service of the public and not for a job or a business. We guarantee that this (the abolishment of the said Act) will happen during a Government led by the NPP.”   The provisions of the Presidents’ Entitlements Act, No. 4 of 1986 provides for former Presidents to be granted a rent-free place of residence, a monthly secretarial allowance, transport facilities, and a monthly pension including for the widow/widower in the event of a former President’s demise.

However, with new developments in the arts sphere, especially those that have distanced people from the theatrical arts, there is a pressing need to support and strengthen stage dramas. One of the main ways of achieving it is by preparing the new generation to embrace the beauty and meaningfulness of stage dramas.   To achieve this, it is important to initiate a discourse on the role of stage dramas in Sri Lanka’s culture, tradition, and society, and to facilitate the process of creating a new generation of stage drama lovers.    Emphasising this timely need, the history of stage dramas and its future in Sri Lanka was discussed at a recent online discussion attended by Tower Hall Theatre Foundation Director General (DG) Dr. D.M.S. Dissanayake and the University of Colombo’s Department of Sinhala’s former Head Senior Prof. Anura Wickramasinghe. The discussion, organised by the Department of Government Information, further focused on the influence of the stage drama tradition that revolves around the Tower Hall and the growth of Sri Lanka’s stage drama sector, and what steps need to be taken for the country’s stage drama sector’s future.          Tower Hall’s role in SL’s stage drama scene      According to Dr. Dissanayake, the Tower Hall, which was declared open in 1911, was not only a part of notable socially important movements and events but also initiated certain movements in the theatrical arts sphere. “Following the screening of the   Pandukabhaya   stage drama at the Tower Hall Theatre, the era of the “Tower Hall” came into existence in Sri Lanka. At a time when the main visual and auditory entertainment medium was the stage drama and there was no television or high quality, locally made movies, the Tower Hall Theatre played a role in instilling stage drama into the minds of Sri Lankan fans.”    He also spoke of the trying times that the Tower Hall Theatre saw in the 1960s-1970s, adding that the decline of the institution also affected the artistes who were affiliated with it. At one point, he reminisced, the presenting of stage dramas in the Tower Hall Theatre was halted. However, it was restored later and the artistes were supported. This revival, he added, paved the way for the establishment of the Tower Hall Theatre Foundation, which at present renders a great service to the stage drama sector.   According to Prof. Wickramasinghe, the Tower Hall Theatre was the centre of the type of drama called “nurthi”, which he said focused on creating good citizens and society through stage dramas. He added that aside from that, there are a number of other specialities at the Tower Hall Theatre. Speaking of the influence of the Tower Hall Theatre, he explained that back then, stage dramas were associated with the general culture and that therefore, the Tower Hall Theatre had a strong connection with and an influence on Sri Lankan culture. “Not only did stage drama focus on visual entertainment but also discussed other aspects of the people’s lives through a theatrical performance, and stage drama played a key role in shaping people’s lives,” Prof. Wickramasinghe added.         Creating a new generation       Meanwhile, Dr. Dissanayake explained that a number of initiatives are being implemented or planned in order to support stage dramas and artistes, and also to strengthen their relationship with the general public. The people and their limited attraction to stage drama, he said, is a situation that needs to be addressed.    As part of these initiatives, a drama school has been set up at the Sandilippai Cultural Center in Jaffna for the children of the North. The first batch, which consists of 50 students, is currently studying at this school. The main objective of this initiative, Dr. Dissanayake said, is to provide trained labour for the stage drama industry. He is hopeful that such initiatives will help create actors, directors, and scriptwriters as well. In addition, he revealed that plans are afoot to hold a Tamil drama festival before the end of the year. In a context where bringing Tamil stage drama actors to Colombo is a costly endeavour, holding such a drama festival based on the drama school in Jaffna will be easier and would be a good opportunity for the people of the North and the East, according to Dr. Dissanayake.    “This year, we are launching a course on acting. The speciality of this programme is that students will be enrolled based on their inherent skills and genuine interest, not necessarily on educational qualifications such as the General Certificate of Education (GCE) Advanced Level (A/L) or Ordinary Level (O/L) qualifications. Through this course, National Vocational Qualification certificates will also be awarded, and the students will be trained to be the next generation of Tower Hall actors. This requires overseas training, especially to acquire the influence of countries with a developed stage drama culture, and the programme that is necessary to achieve it is being planned.”   At the same time, plans are afoot to train actors in music and dancing, in order to improve the quality of artistes who are currently being trained, and plans are in place to commence a suitable course.    With regard to the need to have in place a programme to support young and school-level stage drama actors as well as upcoming actors, Dr. Dissanayake said: “The Tower Hall Foundation is conducting programmes to support them. However, more support is needed, including a national programme and a fund. At present, one of the main issues faced by young stage drama makers is the massive amount of money required to create a stage drama. I think that in the current context, it costs at least Rs. 3-4 million to create a drama that involves 30-40 individuals. If we had a strong fund, we would be able to provide financial assistance, such as a loan, to such individuals.” He expressed confidence about launching a national programme to establish such a fund in future.         Strengthening the stage drama industry   Dr. Dissanayake pointed out the importance of supporting not just the stage drama industry but also those involved in it, who have the potential to enter the industry. “Artistes in their old age and retired are provided with a pension. The biggest challenge we face in this regard is going beyond that pension in order to create an environment where those artistes are enabled to support themselves before or at the time of retirement. The necessary steps to achieve this are underway.”   He said that in many cases, stage dramas are shown in conference halls, which could affect the quality of such a performance, and that this situation has raised the importance of having a dedicated system of theatres for stage drama. He added that the existing theatres should be developed to the necessary level.   With regard to financial stability, Dr. Dissanayake added: “Instead of continuing to depend on the Treasury, especially in the current state of the country, the Tower Hall Theatre Foundation is planning to look for ways to earn adequate revenue in order to sustain itself within the coming two to three years.”   Meanwhile, both Prof. Wickramasinghe and Dr. Dissanayake spoke of education on stage drama and the theatrical arts in the education system. In this regard, Prof. Wickramasinghe pointed out that stage drama has become an important part of education, and that regardless of the teachers’ knowledge of drama, many teachers employ stage drama-related techniques and activities in academic activities. Dr. Dissanayake said: “Stage drama is a form of visual expression of free thinking, which, in most cases, is philosophical. This, therefore, is psychological. Stage dramas were shown due to many reasons, and in the current context, it is possible to use stage drama to convey developmental messages. However, we have to be careful because if we try to create a stage drama merely to express a certain message, it could affect the nature of the stage drama. The Tower Hall Theatre Foundation has been set up to build a high quality stage drama culture, and such high quality drama is created through certain economic, social, and political messages expressed through stage drama. However, limiting stage drama to a certain subject or matter could affect the quality of the stage drama. We have to identify what we want to build in this process. Stage drama should move forward through free thinking. I am of the opinion that the stage drama culture would collapse if we guide stage drama makers along a certain direction and create stage dramas within those limiting parameters.”        ",TRUE,3S7hjFYyt1Zgvl15YHH1GEuruUi2,Waruna  Prabath,0,"Stage dramas have played a pivotal role in Sri Lanka’s theatrical arts sector, and there are a plethora of examples that uphold that rich history.

Recently, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) of the World Bank Group provided $ 400 million to three local private banks. In addition, the appreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee followed the inflow of $ 500 million into local banks, thereby adding to the foreign exchange liquidity of the country. The tourism sector and foreign remittances have also shown an increase when compared to the earnings of the same period last year (2022).”   The Governor also stated that after clearing the IMF hurdle, the country should boldly face the changes necessary to bring the economy back. “There may be temporary hardships, but we have to stick to the requirements if we are to maintain essential services for the public.

This was when nine fundamental rights petitions filed by various parties including President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Opposition Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake, seeking the invalidation of the recommendations made by the relevant Commission, requesting the Court to issue a writ order quashing the Commission’s recommendations against them and requesting an interim order preventing the implementation of the recommendations until the hearing of the petition is concluded, were taken up in Court.    The three-member CoI was appointed by then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on 20 January 2020. The other two members are retired Court of Appeal Judge, Justice Daya Chandrasiri Jayathilake and retired Inspector General of Police Chandra Fernando.    The Commission was entrusted with the task of inquiring into alleged acts of political victimisation that took place in the wake of investigations conducted by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, the Financial Crimes Investigation Division, the Criminal Investigations Department, and the Special Investigation Unit of the Police from 8 January 2015, to 16 November 2019.     The Commission was also instructed to conduct an in-depth investigation into serious fraud, corruption, and the abuse of State resources, privileges, power and authority. As per a newspaper advertisement, the Commission had received 1,971 complaints for investigation. The report of the CoI was handed over to Rajapaksa in December 2020. The report consists of three volumes and 2,043 pages. Later, Rajapaksa formed a Special CoI to create a suitable mechanism to implement the recommendations of the final report compiled by the said CoI.

Ananda College skipper Nethma Samaraweera won the toss and elected to field first. Nalandians got off to a fiery start with Yasiru Samarakoon hitting a couple of boundaries inside the first five overs. However, an error in judgment between the two openers cost Samarakoon’s wicket for Nalanda.      However, in-form Rusiru Vilochana and Sadew Samarasinghe made sure not to panic as the pair added 56 runs for the second wicket. Vilochana was the chief destroyer, but unfortunately missed out on a half century.       Samarasinghe too perished after getting a start, as Ananda kept a lid on the scoring with wickets in consistent intervals. Kushmitha Silva was a big wicket for the Amandians as he looked most threatening with the bat.       Despite the fall of wickets, the Nalandians had enough contributions from the bat until the very end. Cameos from skipper Chanul Athukorala, Senesh Wijesinghe, Sajitha Vithanage and Minod Caldera helped them reach 252 for 8 in their allotted 50 overs.

Lalani,https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/the-morning-39270.appspot.com/o/articles%2F0R8E4pZgwJzrQV0JY17H?alt=media&token=e7b05275-88ad-4450-8b7c-9d6fa2e8fe71,A vision for lasting change,opinion," In one of the most seminal stories in recent history, Lewis Carroll wrote the following response when Alice, in her expeditions through Wonderland, asked why a Tiger-lily spoke so boldly when no other flower in any other garden could even talk: “In most gardens,” the Tiger-lily said, “they make the beds too soft – so that the flowers are always asleep.”   The digital age we live in now is a dangerous and defining one. The gardens of our land are employing methods far more intricate than delusions of complacency. The conditions of our inaction are born not out of a lack of will or frailty of soul, but inevitability: a paralysing fear that what’s to come is too complex and too powerful to do anything against.      Social media and consequences      Social media carried the torch as platforms like Facebook and Twitter grew to heights unprecedented at speeds unfathomable. These new technologies not only drastically altered the way we live, but actively characterised how we think and interact with our communities.   With the instant connectivity between long distance friends and family, real-time updates of news on the ground, or the opportunity to broadcast your capabilities to be competitive on the job market, we quickly realised that the risk of not participating in this vast digital world had catastrophic, real-world ramifications.   In a lot of ways, they shone a light on the best of us: from teenage influencers expressing their marginalised identities to grassroots activists mobilising their coworkers to rally against unjust labour practices, social media provided a megaphone for the voiceless and a proxy for change to the hopeful.   But while the good now had a way to become great, the bad was similarly amplified to become worse. Racist and sexist ideologies and rampant harassment fuelled the widening of existing disparities. Hard truths and incendiary fictions were thrust into the same news cycles in order to optimise for engagement and virality.    And now we see the direct consequences in the degradation of democratic processes worldwide, as authoritarian regimes employ draconian measures of silencing opposition, spreading disinformation, and surveilling any indication of resistance.      Betraying fundamental human rights   Here in Sri Lanka we are currently witnessing a deliberate effort by the Government to pass a law that will betray fundamental human rights. Through the establishment of overreaching Executive powers and broad measures rife with opportunities for abuse, the proposed Online Safety Bill introduces a dangerous path in which people in power have free reign to exploit those who oppose them.   While this bill may seem as if it possesses regulation on online harassment, child abuse, and disinformation, it is packaged with provisions that ask us to surrender our right to protest, ultimately sacrificing our freedom of expression.    Even the protections from hate speech and security threats have the potential to be turned on its head when the wrong person interprets them as dissent. Phrases like “national security” and “distress” are thrown around without meaning or context, implying that the bill was drafted without the care and intent necessary to combat such a significant problem.   It is important to understand that this is not a new trend: much along the same lines, the implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) has time and time again subverted the very nature of the act in upholding human rights by suppressing and incarcerating citizens exercising their rights to free speech.    Journalists, entertainers, and religious groups have all been targeted under the guise of a treaty that strove to protect them for the very thing they are being locked up for. Through disproportionate punishments to a fundamental lack of understanding of what online safety even constitutes, this sort of repression will not only be extended but amplified once the Online Safety Bill is enacted.   Civil proponents of the bill will argue that the benefits in safety outweigh these potential risks. But safety at the cost of freedom has historically and universally never been a price worth paying. And this is not a price we should have to pay to reap the benefits of the most liberating, technologically forward era in modern history!      Replicating virtues online   But operating within the bounds of these new worlds requires that the virtues we uphold in reality are replicated online. Otherwise, we surrender our rights to actors that continue to prioritise the potential for larger profits over any pursuit of a healthy, inclusive information ecosystem.   The way we perceive any form of resolution influences how we understand the threat. And for many of us, the threat is too obscure, too complicated, too out-of-reach to do anything against. We are the flowers that remain asleep, while the privileged few among us take the wheel in setting up our digital futures.   I want to make it clear that this is not a condemnation of innovation nor a unilateral appeal to virtues of grace and unity. Rather, I propose a strong case for a vision that can both guarantee that the right measures to combat online harms are in place and to strengthen our democracy at large.   Sri Lanka should be using the same civic participatory approach they are employing to oppose the Online Safety Bill as a foundational mechanism to help craft these laws in the first place. At this very moment, civil society activists, journalists, lawyers, influencers, and entertainers are collaborating to collectively petition the bill before it goes to a parliamentary vote.      Important tenets of democracy   This type of grassroots advocacy upholds three important tenets of democracy.   First, the inclusion of diverse voices across society that possess the lived experience and unique perspectives to assess pervasive impact and provide universal scrutiny. When it comes to how each one of us takes advantage of the internet, there are vast differences between a mid-level journalist trying to garner views on groundbreaking local news and an elderly tuk-tuk driver attempting to register through QR codes for fuel rations. It is up to us to ensure that moral action is never undertaken alone and always encompasses stakeholders that feel the most drastic effects of these malicious pursuits.   The second tenet of the framework is the reinforcement of individual agency so that each and every one of us have the power to hold these systems in check. Our dependence on others to do the heavy lifting for us will only comply with existing misconceptions that a happy populace is an ignorant one. We each need to have a strong understanding of the mechanisms that keep us sleeping and build an intuition for resilience.   And finally, we need to persist. Any bid for lasting change dies when righteous convictions become harboured and never expressed. The necessity for relentlessness is a key characteristic of any democracy. Attrition is a most powerful adversary, and one quick to be taken advantage of if left unchecked.   As I pointed out, these principles are already being practised in our current battle against the Online Safety Bill. The endurance and moral capacity of civil actors has kept the fight going during the two-week period of appeal before the final verdict of the higher court. And while there are important lessons to be learned from and for this type of advocacy, it still provides a solid bedrock for future cohesion when faced with draconian legislation.      Alternative measures    There are alternative measures that encompass this vision and still secure protections on the internet. Foundationally, we need Big Tech companies like Meta and Google to commit to establishing a less precarious pipeline of communication between their regional directors and the Sri Lankan community.    Through routine check-ins, constant sharing of cultural translations, and connections from contextual violations to pre-existing community standards on these platforms, we can prove to these tunnel-visioned corporations that despite a smaller market share in the grand scheme of things, what happens in Sri Lanka has massive implications for the region at large.   Another opportunity is in building a democratically-elected proxy of our own, composed of representatives from every identity, discipline, province, and socioeconomic background. This proxy can be a virtuous contrast to the overly executive and unilateral Online Safety Commission proposed in the Online Safety Bill.    Cohesiveness is crucial when we are all fighting the same battle and have similar goals, and this institutionalised form of communication could be extremely efficient in collating perspectives to reach tech companies and forming petitions against unjust laws.   Digital literacy, a popular solution for building civic awareness and privacy protections, is also key in this movement. But only if we adopt a terminology that is culturally reflective and resonant with individuals that do not have the bandwidth to keep up to date with the technicalities of being online.    In this, we can take advantage of the country’s best storytellers and influencers to convey not only abstract calls for data privacy or against misinformation, but relatable rectitudes of the lived experience of women being harassed on Facebook or rumours being spread about the threat of outsiders.      Continue to fight   All too often, hope and bids for change are thought to be resigned to the privileged, but as we’ve learned in democracies around the globe, idealism is no longer a luxury because access to technology is no longer a luxury.    Our shared capacity in tweeting our thoughts on the latest episode of ‘The Voice’ or posting a TikTok of our families shamelessly dancing is now a human right, and that especially extends to offering opposing views. Use this power to make your stance against injustices heard – show people in power that they cannot get away with compromising basic human rights.   And so we must continue to fight. We fight for the universal pervasiveness of civil liberties in the digital information realm. We fight against the online amplification of autocracy and disparity. We fight the systemic suppression of free speech and we fight the voices that take that right for granted to incite violence and intensify discrimination.

Furthermore, the Inter-University Bhikkhus’ Federation (IUBF) similarly condemned this move and expects to decide what initiatives to take in this regard today (28).   IUSF Acting Convenor Terance Rodrigo, speaking to   The Morning   yesterday, stated that the matter will be discussed within the IUSF and the relevant steps will be taken in this regard.   “Given the urgency of the Government in this regard, we are still in a bid to analyse the current situation. This is to target the student leaders of the universities. We are highly critical of this move. It is not that the students are willingly skipping examinations and staying at the universities.    “It happens because of their involvement in political activities in order to achieve the rights and justice deserved by society and the student community, which is why their degrees are being delayed for years. In order to achieve the dreams of many, they are losing their personal dreams.    “The student leaders of the calibre of comrade Mudalige (a reference to IUSF Convenor Wasantha Mudalige, who is currently being detained under the Prevention of Terrorism [Temporary Provisions] Act [PTA]) could easily obtain their degrees with flying colours. But they have opted to fight for the rights of the future generations instead,” he said.   Furthermore, he accused the administrative bodies of the universities of intentionally curtailing university undergraduates actively involved in extracurricular and political activities under the pretext of the 80% attendance requirement.   “It is not that the students are willingly skipping examinations. The university administrations have imposed rules to require 80% attendance to sit for the examinations. They aim to restrain the students to the lecture halls. Because of such rules, the undergraduates are unable to face the examinations and complete their degrees on time. We hope to discuss this matter with our members and come to a decision in the coming days. We will let you know of our initiatives in this regard,” he added.   “Given the complexity of the present context, we have not been able to discuss this incident yet. But there will be a meeting tomorrow (28) to discuss this matter. After discussing this, we will make a collective decision in this regard and let you know,” said IUBF Acting Convenor Ven. Udenigama Gunarathana Thera.   Meanwhile, President Ranil Wickremesinghe commented in Parliament on 24 November about the time spent by Mudalige at university, saying: “I do not know about other matters, but no university student has been arrested over this ‘aragalaya’. Only Mudalige was arrested for this. He has been in university for eight or nine years now. What does this mean? I left university at the age of 21. He is 31 years old, but still in university. In fact, only one extra year can be given to complete a degree. After that, students should leave the university. That’s all there is to do,” he said.   In this backdrop, State Minister of Higher Education Dr. Suren Raghavan, addressing the media, said that moves are underway to empower the University Act No. 16 of 1978 to minimise overcrowding due to some students overstaying in the university hostels, to accommodate new student batches.   Dr. Raghavan said that it has come to his attention that most of the overstaying students have been involved in political activities without completing their degrees.   It has accordingly been noted that some students have engaged in politics on the university premises for eight or nine years, and steps have been taken to get a detailed report on the overstaying students.   Meanwhile, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has also instructed all Vice-Chancellors of State universities to take measures against the overstaying students who have not completed their academic courses.   Meanwhile, Federation of University Teachers’ Associations (FUTA) Vice President and Spokesperson Nadish de Silva stated that although this attempt is apparently positive, ulterior motives can be observed in this move.   “It seems that this initiative is a positive initiative. But firstly, the state universities should attempt to complete the academic courses on time. We should let the students complete their studies. We as the universities failed to complete those courses due to various reasons. Because of the current economic crisis that has been crippling the country, the Government is not in a position to spend on education, and rather than expanding the infrastructure and providing other facilities to the universities, the Government is trying to impose such rules. These types of temporary solutions will not address the real predicaments; and imposing rules for the purpose of revenge against critics of the Government cannot be tolerated,” he said.   Furthermore, he pointed out the impossibility of imposing such rules, as it is not permissible to impose laws with retrospective effects.   “I am lecturing at the Open University. In this university, all the students who were recruited are allowed to finish their course of study within 12 years. If we are to change this law, it will only apply to those who will be recruited after that law. We cannot have retrospective laws as such,” he added.   In the meantime,   The Morning   learned that the relevant law is being drafted by the Ministry of Higher Education under the observance of the UGC. Speaking to   The Morning  , Secretary to the Ministry of Education M. Nihal Ranasinghe said that the Ministry will put forward the bill to the Cabinet once it is drafted by the Ministry of Higher Education.    “This subject comes under the purview of State Minister Dr. Raghavan. I believe that the UGC is involved in drafting this Bill. Once they have finished the Bill and sent it to us, we will do the needful in accordance with the law as the Ministry. Until such time, the matter is being handled by the State Ministry,” he said.

Hatching eggs are being imported as the importation of mother hens delays the availability of eggs and chicks, the Ministry explained. This move makes it easier to get chickens for eggs and meat within a short period of time, the Ministry added.   Thus, Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera has instructed the officials to take steps to provide the chicks obtained from this stock of 176,000 hatching eggs imported from the Netherlands to private sector chicken farms, which were closed during the Covid-19 pandemic situation, at a subsidised price.

According to the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA), so far this year (2023), a total of 47,353 tourists have arrived in Sri Lanka, and the tourism industry plans to see 105,000 tourist arrivals by the end of this month. At the same time, even amidst the economic crisis, many tourists have recommended Sri Lanka as a potential travel destination and have stressed the importance of supporting the country’s tourism industry.   In this context, making Sri Lanka a safe and pleasant place for tourists is a top priority in order to attract more of them. However, despite this pressing need, there is no scarcity of reports of tourists facing various forms of unfair treatment at the hands of Sri Lankans. During the past few months, a number of social media posts showed tourists being scammed and verbally harassed in Sri Lanka, while certain social media posts made by tourists who had visited the country also cautioned others who were planning to visit the country regarding such mistreatment.   From taxi drivers, tourist guides, and restaurant owners that overcharge tourists and at times harass their customers in the process, to various institutions and tourist attractions that require tourists to pay exorbitantly high prices compared to what Sri Lankans pay, this issue exists in various forms. Even though the authorities appear to be taking action against this, many such incidents go unaddressed either because they are not reported or are not technically illegal under Sri Lankan law. However, the damage these acts cause to Sri Lanka’s reputation, especially to the tourism industry, is massive. Firstly, tourists that face such incidents are unlikely to visit the country again. Further, these incidents would greatly affect the recommendations made by tourists who have visited the country, which, according to studies, are among the leading factors travellers consider when choosing a certain destination.   Therefore, regardless of the legality of some such acts, such as overcharging tourists when there are no price-related regulations, Sri Lanka has to take action, and this should go beyond merely taking legal action after a complaint is received, or advising tourists to be careful. The authorities need to be proactive and creative, and focus on the prevention aspect. A system should be in place to not only take legal action, but also to raise awareness on the legal actions that could be taken against those mistreating tourists. At the same time, there should be a massive attitudinal shift in order to guide the people, particularly those who provide services to tourists, to see tourists as consumers, not as golden geese. In addition, the authorities need to implement new laws or regulations to ensure the fair treatment of tourists. Without such changes, the tourism industry will decline faster than it picked up, or will remain stagnant.   As one of the foremost sources of foreign exchange, the importance of the tourism industry in the country’s economic recovery, which depends greatly on how fast the country builds its foreign reserves, cannot be stressed enough. In fact, the decline in tourist arrivals is one of the factors that contributed to the dwindling of foreign reserves. Therefore, at a time when the national economy should become everyone’s priority, the Government should pay more attention to ensuring tourists’ safety and comfort, while those who provide goods and services to tourists should be considered important stakeholders of that process, by not mistreating tourists.

Speaking to   The Daily Morning  , Semasinghe said: “We can see that a few individuals, I don’t know for what reason, are trying to jeopardise the economic recovery. One example is the behaviour of the PUCSL Chairman (Ratnayake). He has become a big obstacle to the unlocking of the IMF bailout package. One individual acting in this manner puts the entire country into a serious situation.”   The Government, led by President and Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policies Ranil Wickremesinghe, and the Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera, has been at loggerheads with the industry regulator, the PUCSL, and especially its Chairman Ratnayake for months. The main reason has been the latter’s vocal opposition to the tariff hike proposed by the Government. Ratnayake has also noted the lack of legal provisions for an interim tariff revision, and also for a tariff revision that has retrospective effect.   Semasinghe claimed that the public should be vigilant about these individuals as the Government’s priority is to engineer a recovery of the economy.      “The Government in power should ensure that the economy is brought back to a stabilised situation. If people are blocking these, I think the public should be vigilant of those people. For us to engage in politics there should be a country and people left,” he said.   However, when contacted by   The Daily Morning   yesterday, Ratnayake stated that independent commissions were empowered to make decisions based on facts and figures and that he was willing to discuss the matter with the IMF, if necessary.   “The tariff revision will take place as scheduled and will be done scientifically. If the IMF has any issues, they can come and discuss the matter with us. This is the only institution among the failed and mismanaged State Owned Enterprises such as the SriLankan Airlines, Water Board, etc. which has looked at a electricity tariff revision positively twice. What is the IMF's view on other institutions such as SriLankan Airlines or Ceylon Petroleum Corporation? What have they done? We increased the tariff in August 2022 and will once again revise it in the next 2-3 days. Unlike any other institution, the officials at the PUCSL have been working 24 hours to revise the tariffs. This is the commitment we have.”   Speaking further, Ratnayake noted that with last year’s tariff increase and the impending tariff revision, the annual income for the CEB will be equivalent to $ 1 billion.    Speaking of the electricity tariff revision due to be announced this week, Ratnayake commented: “Everyone will be surprised and pleased – the CEB and electricity consumers included.”        ",TRUE,CIZLop1eNQgLt0ggozjxXC5H1Zm1,Wasantha Warnakulasuriya,0,State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe claimed yesterday (12) that the conduct of Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) Chairman Janaka Ratnayake is contributing to the delay in Sri Lanka,,0,1676228506,829000000,0VjksPKDIjsrRBGLMRI3,,

In hindsight, two key factors helped some organisations to perform better through this challenging period.    The first was the availability of data and information across the supply chain. Organisations that integrated data visibility better across their supply chain were able to tackle the unprecedented changes and come out on the other side.   The second factor was how integrated the supply chain was overall. Organisations with fragmented supply chain operations found it difficult to create the required level of integration for a seamless operation.    As a result of the challenges faced, organisations are investing in harnessing real-time data and information to enable faster decision-making.    Some of the lessons learned, especially in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry, which runs on reasonably stable plans, is how to think differently and become more agile, and how to respond to change faster. If we took one month to respond to change previously, now we need to respond within a week, or at times even within a day.    Even though scenario planning was always talked about, very few companies had put it into practice. At Hemas Consumer Brands, we have now made it the norm to have two to three scenario plans depending on which scenario comes to life.    The importance of data was underscored over the years and more so since supply chains were considerably dependent on people prior to the pandemic. Given that people had difficulty reaching workplaces throughout the pandemic and economic crisis, it became more important to have a common database which would allow faster decision-making.    The pandemic taught us how to make decisions faster, which required making information and data available, so that there is less dependence on employees’ physical presence.   Digitalisation is playing a starring role in upgrading value chains. Making data visible across teams and digital transformation of the supply chain is an ongoing endeavour. Dashboards can be created to provide visibility for data and information and democratised data for a wider pool of employees, so that it is not only accessible to a few. Open sharing of data and information enables teams to make better decisions for the benefit of the organisation.    Globally it was observed that only 30% of digitisation gives you Return on Investment (ROI). Yes, there are times it does not give an ROI immediately. But if you look into the future, in terms of how supply chains will be operating in another 10-15 years, if you don’t make these investments today and gear your people, systems, and processes to be more data-driven and more digitally driven, you will be at a competitive disadvantage at that point in time.   Needless to say, geopolitics played a critical role in upsetting the supply chain apple cart. Every country depends on supplies from different markets and supply sources, and with Sri Lanka being a small country with limited resources, manufacturing organisations in the FMCG space depend heavily on global supply chain networks.    The Russia-Ukraine war impacted supply chains globally. I believe more than 90% of the time these factors are outside of our control, but from the perspective of supply chain professionals, what is important is to move from merely responding to these changes to creating the ability to predict the future – what the impact to our supply chain is going to be from geopolitical issues. At present, we are likely to head into another unanticipated impact with the unfolding situation in Gaza.   Over the last 12 months, one of the things that we have done is build a set of capable people to drive digitalisation. We have invested heavily in people, building a strong team into our supply chain to enable us to take forward our journey in building strong and resilient supply chains. Many organisations have understood the importance of prioritisation and in addition to investing in the people, have created the right prioritisation.   Some of the key skills of supply chain leaders are to understand the total value chain. You should be able to map your value chain from your supplier to customer in your head, including the integration points and the interdependencies.   As a supply chain leader, you should be able to communicate with stakeholders, including external and internal stakeholders, to ensure expectations are aligned and manageable. You will need to communicate effectively with your sales, marketing, manufacturing, and finance teams, who will have different expectations from your supply chain. This is extremely important. Finally, how you manage and engage your people is key to a successful supply chain.   Greening your value chain has become imperative and organisations are working on a very strong programme in environmental sustainability by collecting as much non-biodegradable plastic waste to offset and recycle plastics used in the value chain. Different work streams working within the supply chain as well as outside can reduce the amount of plastics used in the manufacturing process.    From a sustainability perspective, our biggest achievement has been to create this mindset across the organisation of the importance of sustainability, because it is not something that one or two people in the organisation can drive. It is something that everyone in all departments, including the supply chain, needs to rally behind and think of sustainable solutions in day-to-day operations.

According to the Citizenship Act, No. 18 of 1948, the citizenship of a Sri Lankan citizen ceases when they obtain citizenship in another country. They should make the relevant applications and obtain dual citizenship if they desire to resume the status as a citizen of Sri Lanka.   Early this month, the CID had recorded a statement from Gamage in relation to the complaint which had been lodged by activist Oshala Herath, alleging that Gamage had obtained two Sri Lankan diplomatic passports while holding two British passports, and had submitted forged documents including a fake birth certificate to obtain them.   The related case is being heard at the Colombo Magistrate's Court.   According to the relevant statement, which was seen by The Daily Morning, the CID has questioned Gamage about the fact that she was mentioned as a British citizen in the data available in the Department of Immigration and Emigration in relation to obtaining residence visa to stay in Sri Lanka by furnishing two British passports bearing numbers 094425352 and 521398876. In response, she has claimed that her mother is a British citizen, and that she had therefore received British citizenship through her mother. However, she has mentioned that she had lived in the United Kingdom since 1981 and returned to Sri Lanka in 2014. At that time, she claimed that she had submitted the relevant documents stating that she did not need British citizenship, after which it was revoked.   At that time, the CID had queried her as to whether she had obtained dual citizenship at any time. In response, Gamage has stated that she had never obtained dual citizenship. The CID has also shown her the documents related to the visas she had obtained to stay in Sri Lanka and Gamage has admitted that they are related to her.   Meanwhile, the CID has also questioned Gamage about the birth certificate bearing number 6553 which is believed to have been used by her to obtain a Sri Lankan passport. In relation to that, she has mentioned that she has never had such a birth certificate in her possession. She has further claimed that she has never used such a birth certificate or submitted such to the Immigration and Emigration Department.   The Additional District Registrar of the Thimbirigasyaya Divisional Secretariat (DS) Office, Jeewani Karunaratne had earlier said that she had examined the birth certificate bearing number 6553, which had been submitted by Gamage to obtain a passport, using the computer data system of the DS Office, and concluded that the relevant birth certificate was fake.   Two cases are being heard at the Colombo Magistrate's Court and the Court of Appeal regarding Gamage's alleged violation of the relevant laws by obtaining Sri Lankan passports while holding the British citizenship. Allegations of producing fake national identity cards (NIC), passports, and birth certificates to obtain passports have also been levelled against her. The Colombo Magistrate's Court recently stated that there was sufficient evidence to support that Gamage had obtained a Sri Lankan passport by submitting a fake NIC and birth certificate.

The Cabinet has advised the President’s Secretary to appoint an expert committee for the purpose of obtaining necessary recommendations to complete restructuring and improvement of the Sri Lanka Railways service.   Speaking at the Cabinet media briefing held yesterday (25), Cabinet Spokesperson and Minister of Transport and Highways Dr. Bandula Gunawardana said that the Government has made this decision in order to make the Department a profit-making public institution instead of privatising it. He also added that the restructuring programme will be continued despite the disruptive actions of various groups affiliated with the Department.   “The Department has been classified as a Grade A Government Department. Therefore, the Government understood the requirement of restructuring the Department in order to render a quality service to the passengers without causing any inconvenience. The Department has obtained the consent of all the relevant parties in this regard. Therefore, the Cabinet approved the proposal furnished by me to appoint a committee to look into the matter,” he said.   Meanwhile, over 35 trains were cancelled on Monday (24), owing to a trade union action launched by a group of engine drivers on 23 July against the Department’s efforts to commence several new train services. Furthermore, four office trains were also cancelled last morning since the assistant engine drivers had not reported to duty, according to the Railway Engine Drivers Union Chairman Chandana Lal. The said trains were those plying from Colombo Fort to Rambukkana, Polgahawela, and Gampaha.   Speaking to the media in this regard, Minister Gunawardana emphasised that a strict decision will be reached in the Cabinet against the execution of railway strikes causing inconvenience to the public. However, the Minister, who claimed that the passengers’ demand was to privatise the railway service, mentioned that it is not possible, and also requested time to make the Department an authority in order to solve the issues pertaining to the railways, without privatising it. The Minister also said that he intends to take necessary action against the people attempting to obstruct the services provided to the public by the Department, even when he has personally intervened to stop the privatisation of the Department.

Many side with Israel and emphasise its right to exist. Some bemoan the nature of Israeli apartheid in Palestine while condemning Hamas. Others, prominently anti-Zionist Jewish groups, call for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip.    There is very little love lost on Benjamin Netanyahu or his regime, even if Hamas’s incursions have forced him to form a coalition with the Opposition. That, though, has not prevented the West, barring a few countries in Europe, from throwing its weight behind Israel.   The Western political establishment’s inability to call out Israeli atrocities in the Gaza Strip is surprising, to say the least. At a time when the Israeli Government is turning Hamas’s attacks into an excuse for barricading Gaza, Europe is debating the most unhelpful point ever: whether to withhold aid to Palestine.    To their credit, France and Spain have opposed such actions, drawing a line between the Palestinian people and outfits like Hamas. But that the EU considered such measures, even for a moment, when it has been forthcoming if not generous about its aid to Ukraine, should disturb everyone.      Where is the outrage?   If people are siding with Palestine, despite Hamas being a Palestinian outfit, it is because the latter has been identified, rightly or wrongly, with the Palestinian cause. To say this is not to condone the spate of violence spreading in the region. The killing of innocents is wrong, and, if proved, should be condemned.    But the people of Gaza have been systematically starved, dispossessed, and brutalised for over half a century. The Israelis have been occupying the Strip since 1967. More than 100,000 hectares of land have been plundered and more than 50,000 homes have been demolished. Where is the outrage?      Moral dimension    There is clearly a moral dimension to these issues. But there is also a geopolitical dimension, which several commentators have written on. Depending on how you view it, Hamas’s recent incursions were a success or a failure. I tend to view them as a short-term setback and a long-term gain.    In a piece to   Foreign Policy  , Daniel Byman suggests that Hamas may have wanted to dent Israel’s overtures to Arab countries vis-à-vis the Abraham Accords. The country, after all, was on the verge of signing an important agreement with Saudi Arabia. Byman argues, however, that while Hamas may have deterred the Saudis, it may revisit the agreement once the conflict ends. The jury is still out there.   On the other hand, as   The Economist   recently reported, the violence has brought Israel and the US together. For all its support of Israel, the Biden administration did, at one level, avoid embracing Netanyahu and his policies. But this was because Israel itself had turned against his regime, as witnessed by the large protests against his moves to curb the country’s judiciary.    Yet I frankly think   The Economist   report fails to distinguish between US opposition to Israel’s turn to the right and the US’s fundamental embrace of Israel’s ‘right to exist’. The fact that foes like Netanyahu and Benny Gantz can form a coalition, despite their differences, shows that in the face of external threats, the Israeli State will unite itself.      Far-reaching ramifications    Hamas’s actions have ramifications going beyond the Middle East. The US has learnt the hard way how not to intervene in the region. In this regard, it has always viewed Israel as a convenient proxy.    Fundamentally, Israel is a settler colony funded by the US. Washington sends aid to the tune of $ 3 billion a year. Considering that the EU sends $ 700 million or so every year to Palestinians, this is a massive capital inflow.   Israel’s activities in the Gaza Strip, however, has led to a shift in Western public opinion. Groups like the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement, and the pro-Palestine Jewish Voice for Peace underlie this clearly.    Moreover, Hollywood celebrities, who would have thought twice about talking on Palestine’s behalf – remember the reaction to Vanessa Redgrave’s speech at the 1978 Oscars? – have become more vocal. The killing of an   Al Jazeera   journalist by Israeli Defence Forces has also helped tilt the balance in favour of the Palestinian cause.   The war can tilt this balance either way. On the one hand, mainstream Western academics and politicians supportive of Palestine have condemned Hamas, while on the other, those on the Left, like Tariq Ali, see it as the late Edward Said saw the First Intifada in 1987, as an anti-colonial uprising. It depends on how Hamas interprets the right to resist that is more or less enshrined in international law.       Undermining Israel   In Gillo Pontecorvo’s ‘Battle of Algiers’ and Costa Gavras’s ‘State of Siege,’ the guerillas take care to distinguish between the enemy and civilians. The ability to draw this line is what sets successful guerilla movements apart from unsuccessful ones and what helps such outfits rally mass support. The killing of innocents may be seen as necessary collateral in the short-term. But in the long-term, it will be counterproductive.   Rathindra Kuruwita argues, and I agree, that Hamas’s actions have undermined Israel. The latter, he adds, has already lost. The convulsions of domestic politics, the loss of the moral high ground, and Europe’s wavering support for Israel, especially in countries like Spain, have cost the Government badly.    It remains to be seen whether the US will intervene to help: it has shipped aid to the country and will continue to do so. Over the next few days we will see the war’s impact on oil prices and global trade.    Regardless of these issues, however, the Global South has chosen the path of solidarity with Palestine. That underlies arguably the most important takeaway from the ongoing conflict: that wars do not and will not end, even if they are crushed militarily, if underlying causes are not addressed. For over half a century, Palestinians have been waiting. They cannot be expected to wait any longer.       (The writer is a freelance columnist who can be reached at udakdev1@gmail.com.

Instead, we are required to merely restructure our balance sheet, which involves restructuring certain financial facilities that have been obtained,” he stated.   He revealed that this balance sheet restructuring would also involve the winding up of certain idle and defunct subsidiaries of the RDA, such as the three Maga Neguma companies – Maga Neguma Construction Equipment Company, Maga Neguma Emulsion Production Company, and Maga Neguma Consultancy and Management Company.   Elaborating further, he stated: “There are certain subsidiaries which are not functioning, such as the Maga Neguma companies. Obviously, they have no work at present and the employees are just idling. We can’t continue to pay their salaries. Therefore, we are considering winding up the companies following the payment of compensation to these employees.”   He revealed that the RDA would also be winding up its expressway bus subsidiary as well.   Weerakoon shared that he did not expect any opposition from the employees of these subsidiaries, since the employees themselves had requested the winding up of the respective defunct companies.   The former Road Planning and Development Company, which at one time existed under the RDA, was terminated to establish Maga Neguma Construction Equipment Company Ltd., Maga Neguma Emulsion Production Company Ltd., and Maga Neguma Consultancy and Management Company Ltd. in 2014.   Maga Neguma Construction Equipment Company provided construction equipment and machinery to those engaged in road sector development, on recovery of hire charges, and undertook road construction works not exceeding Rs. 100 million awarded by the RDA.   Maga Neguma Emulsion Production Company was involved in the manufacture of emulsion, pre-mix, etc. and supplied the same for road sector development works.

Yet, a recent report estimated that Sri Lanka’s apparel exports would fall by $ 1 billion in 2023, putting tremendous pressure on Sri Lanka’s external debt obligations since apparel accounts for nearly half the country’s merchandise exports.   The United Kingdom has traditionally been a critical export market for Sri Lanka’s apparel industry, nearly 13% of apparel exports were to the UK in 2022. Sri Lanka’s apparel and clothing accessories have a demonstrated history of attracting British buyers. Investors in high-quality locally-manufactured goods include over 100 UK companies operating in Sri Lanka.   The Developing Countries' Trading Scheme (DCTS), which replaced the UK’s Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) has strengthened trade relations between Sri Lanka and the UK.  Sri Lanka’s access to the UK market has benefited from duty-free exports on more than 80% of products and the removal of tariffs on over 150 additional products. While the DCTS has provided Sri Lankan exporters with the opportunity to broaden market access and investments, the Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF) believes that the DCTS mirrors restrictions that existed under the UK’s GSP plus concessions. To successfully navigate the current crisis and strengthen our resilience, more is needed.   Consider extended cumulation. Under GSP concessions, rules of origin requirements have particularly limited Sri Lanka’s utilisation rate for goods that qualify for duty-free imports at only around 50%. As defined by the International Trade Centre, rules of origin establish the nationality of a product and thereby determine whether it is eligible to receive trade concessions under a set scheme.   Since Sri Lanka imports a large part of its textiles and raw material from non-originating countries, even with the many benefits the DCTS accrues for the country, the scheme’s rules of origin hinder the apparel industry’s ability to reap benefits from the trading scheme. However, the DCTS does allow businesses and governments from non-LDCs to make case-by-case applications for extended cumulation. To enable Sri Lanka to draw greater benefits from the scheme, extended cumulation particularly with ASEAN countries should be sought to apply to Sri Lankan apparel, at least for the period during which Sri Lanka is able to overcome the crisis.   The EU’s GSP+ scheme is also being extended in its current format for another three years. The Government should use this opportunity and seek to apply the “de minimis” principle for the non-originating components of Sri Lanka’s apparel exports to the EU. This will support the process of getting the country back on its economic growth path, rather than being reliant on financial aid.   A successful negotiation for these exemptions will foster faster recovery from the economic crisis, prevent the decline in exports and restore these to pre-crisis levels, while protecting jobs that could otherwise be lost as export orders fall for a long period.   JAAF urges the Government to support the apparel industry by applying for extended cumulation and seek a relaxation for non-originating materials with the EU and the UK. The UK’s DCTS is a good place to start.

Sri Lanka’s cricket board said it had invited the International Cricket Council (ICC) to investigate match-fixing allegations after Opposition lawmaker Nalin Bandara claimed in Parliament that the two-match Test series, drawn 1-1, had been fixed.   Talking to   The News  , a PCB official said that the board could not comment on something that was being investigated by the Sri Lankan board and neither could it be linked to the host nation’s cricketers.   The Sri Lanka cricket board has invited ICC Anti-Corruption Unit General Manager Alex Marshall to investigate MP Nalin Bandara’s allegations.   Based on the newly-discovered allegations, the PCB official denied any contact with the Sri Lankan board or the ICC.   “No one – neither the ICC nor has the Sri Lanka board – approached us on the recent allegations made by one of the Opposition leaders regarding the 1-1 drawn Test series between the two countries. So unless and until we are approached, we are not in a position to say anything,” a PCB official said.   The official maintained that ICC Anti-Corruption Unit officials always kept a close watch on international matches these days.   “The ICC Anti-Corruption Unit always keeps a close check on all international matches. They were there in Sri Lanka during the July series, nothing happened, and no eyebrow was raised.”   “If the Sri Lanka board wants to investigate their players, they are free to do that. The PCB has nothing to do with it as it has something to do with Sri Lankan cricketers. We will only react if the Sri Lankan board or ICC approaches us. So far there is no such thing,” he added.      ‘Immense reputational damage’      The Sri Lankan board asked Marshall to visit Sri Lanka and investigate the accusation, which it said had caused “immense reputational damage”.   Sri Lanka Cricket was committed to the game’s integrity and believed an ICC probe was “the correct course of action to take in light of the recent allegations,” a board statement said.   Corruption allegations and infighting have plagued Sri Lanka’s national cricket team over the years.   Former Sports Minister Harin Fernando has said the ICC considered Sri Lanka one of the world’s most corrupt nations under its purview.   One of his predecessors, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, told Parliament last year that match-fixing was rife in Sri Lanka.   The series against Pakistan was played at Galle during the height of Sri Lanka’s economic crisis this year, which saw months of political unrest, power cuts, and nationwide fuel shortages.

It is learnt that Power Loop (Pvt) Ltd. together with a Chinese renewable energy engineering firm had submitted an unsolicited proposal to install rooftop solar panels on 702 medical facilities around the country.   The Sunday Morning   reported on the matter last week.   As per the proposal, seen by   The Sunday Morning  , now approved by the Cabinet, the two companies will enter into a tripartite agreement with the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and Health Ministry for a period of 20 years.   When contacted, the approval of the project was confirmed by Minister of Health Keheliya Rambukwella. According to him, Cabinet approval has been received to enter into a tripartite agreement between the project proponents (Power Loop, Kunming, and CEB). Last week, Minister Rambukwella told   The Sunday Morning   that the Health Ministry needed to reduce its Rs. 2 billion annual electricity bill as it was not sustainable.   It is understood that the Ministry of Health has detailed responsibilities, terms, and conditions for implementation. The Cabinet approval includes the authorisation of the CEB to enter into the tripartite agreement mentioned above and into any other Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA) with the said joint venture for the purposes of this project.   Further, permission has been granted to appoint project staff from the existing staff of the Ministry for Health to implement and monitor the project on a part-time basis.   The company has requested the Ministry of Health to provide 702 locations identified in the detailed list covering nine provinces. However, Provincial Councils such as North Western, Uva, Central, and Western have already started similar projects for the rooftops in hospitals under their purview. The scope of the project is to be revised accordingly, it is said.        Company needs registration       It is learnt that the company which proposed the project had not obtained registration under the Sustainable Energy Authority (SEA) as of November last year. However, it had agreed to the Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee (CANC) that it would obtain registration before signing the agreement.   It is also learnt that even though Cabinet approval has been granted for the project, neither the CANC nor the project committee had visited a completed project of the company.   This, even though the said company lacks adequate previous experience in the domestic renewable energy sector, industry sources told   The Sunday Morning  . However, it is learnt that in the detailed clarifications requested by a letter dated 25 November 2022 over the issues raised by the project committee as per the decision taken at the CANC meeting, the company had agreed to arrange a visit to a completed project upon receiving final approval.      Misleading numbers      The company has agreed to pay 8% of the revenue generated to the Health Ministry as roof rent. It was learnt that the CANC had previously suggested a roof rent of 17%. However, former State Minister of Solar, Wind, and Hydro Power Duminda Dissanayake told   The Sunday Morning   that a national policy of a minimum rate of 15% for roof rent had been established.   It is learnt that the company had proposed 3% royalty or 10% profit share. According to sources close to the matter, following a lengthy negotiation process, the CANC had emphasised that the Ministry of Health should receive a considerable percentage through the proposed investment. Finally, the proponent agreed to provide 8% of revenue to the ministry, it is learnt.   Accordingly, the company expected a turnover of over Rs. 5 billion a year with a capacity of 100 MW in the event the installations are completed. It is also expected that the project will generate an annual output of 141 million kWh, sources told   The Sunday Morning  .   Senior officials close to the matter also told   The Sunday Morning   that the company which won approval had not submitted a detailed project execution plan or consent of the proponent to provide 1% of the total investment as a performance bond as requested by the CANC. Instead, it had submitted a brief rollout plan and refused to provide a 1% performance bond, highlighting that this was an investment and the investor had the interest to complete the project.      CANC recommendations      A CANC and Project Committee (PC) were appointed per Cabinet approval in August last year to evaluate and make recommendations on the proposal submitted by Power Loop (Pvt) Ltd. It is understood that the Project Committee submitted its report early November 2022. The CANC, after having negotiated with the project proponent, had submitted its recommendations on 21 December 2022.   According to the CANC recommendations which   The Sunday Morning   has seen, the proponent is solely responsible for supply, delivery, installation, commissioning, and maintenance of the whole solar energy system at all the relevant locations. The proponent is solely responsible for bearing the expenditure on insurances for the roof equipment power surcharges, fire, etc. Total expenditure on the project is to be invested by the proponent on its own and the Ministry of Health will not bear any costs associated with the project.   The recommendations also state that the company should complete solar panel installations at all the selected locations within a period of 24 months upon signing the agreement and it is solely responsible for disposal of the panels at the end of the term, which shall be at the proponent’s cost.        Minister’s view      When contacted, Minister Rambukwella said the project had been delayed for over five years and it had come to his ministry at its final stages. “The project was sent by the Power and Energy Ministry; it has recommended the project. It was at the CEB for a long time. It had come to the Health Ministry before I had been appointed as Minister. This has dragged on for years,” he said.   Minister Rambukwella further added that Cabinet approval had been received for the project and it would go ahead as per the approval.   In the meantime, when contacted, CEB Chairman Nalinda Ilangakoon said the CEB had only conducted feasibility studies on whether there was sufficient space on the grid and about power transmission.   Attempts by   The Sunday Morning   to contact Power Loop (Pvt) Ltd., which according to project documents is situated at Kaldemulla, Moratuwa, failed. No record of the said company could be found on open source platforms. No website for such a company was available online as of Friday (31 March).

While headline inflation is coming down steadily, core measures – which exclude food and energy – are proving stickier in many economies and wage growth has picked up.   Expectations about future inflation play a key role in driving inflation, as those views influence decisions about consumption and investment which can affect price and wages today. How best to inform people’s views on inflation became an even more crucial consideration as the surge in prices fueled concern that inflation could become entrenched.   In an analytical chapter of the latest World Economic Outlook, we examine how expectations affect inflation and the scope for monetary policy to influence these expectations to achieve a “soft landing”, that is, a scenario where a central bank guides inflation back to its target without causing a deep downturn in growth and employment.         Larger role for inflation expectations   Surveys of professional forecasters have shown that expectations for inflation over the next 12 months – near-term expectations – started a steady rise in 2021 in advanced and emerging market economies alike, then accelerated last year as actual price increases gained momentum. Expectations for inflation five years into the future, however, remained stable, with average levels broadly anchored around central bank targets.   More recently, near-term inflation expectations appear to have turned the corner and begun to shift onto a gradual downward path. Beyond the world of professional forecasters, we see similar patterns of inflation expectations by companies, individuals, and financial market investors, on average.   Movements in near-term expectations are economically important for inflation dynamics. According to our new statistical analysis, after the inflationary shocks in 2021 and early 2022 started unwinding late last year, inflation has been increasingly explained by near-term expectations.   For the average advanced economy, they now represent the primary driver of inflation dynamics. For the average emerging market economy, expectations have grown in importance, but past inflation remains more relevant, suggesting that people may be more backward-looking in these economies. This could reflect in part the historically higher and more volatile inflationary experience in many of these economies.   In fact, we find that inflation in advanced economies typically rises by about 0.8 percentage points for each 1 percentage point rise in near-term expectations while the pass-through is only 0.4 percentage points in emerging market economies.   One factor that could account for this difference is the share of backward-looking versus forward-looking learners across economy groups. When information on inflation prospects is scarce and central bank communications are unclear or lack credibility, people tend to form their views about future price changes based on their current or past inflation experiences – they are more backward-looking learners. By contrast, those who are more forward-looking form their expectations from a broader array of information that could be relevant to future economic conditions, including central bank actions and communications – they are more forward-looking learners.         Policy implications of differences in learning   These differences have important consequences for central banks. As shown in simulations from a new model that allows for differences in learning and expectations formation, policy tightening has less of a dampening effect on near-term inflation expectations and inflation when a greater share of people in the economy are backward-looking learners.   That’s because people more focused on the past do not internalise the fact that interest rate increases today will slow inflation as they weigh on demand in the economy. Therefore, a higher share of backward-looking learners means that the central bank must tighten more to get the same decrease in inflation. In other words, reductions in inflation expectations and inflation come at a higher cost to output when there is a higher share of backward-looking learners.         Enhancing policy effectiveness   Central banks can encourage expectations to be more forward-looking through improvements in the independence, transparency, and credibility of monetary policy and by communicating more clearly and effectively. Such changes help people understand the central bank’s policy actions and their economic effects, boosting the share of forward-looking learners in the economy.   Simulations from the new model show how improvements in monetary policy frameworks and communications can help lower the output costs needed to reduce inflation and inflation expectations, making it more likely the central bank can achieve a soft landing.   One way central banks can improve their communications is by simple and repeated messaging about their objectives and actions that are tailored to the relevant audiences.   However, improving monetary policy frameworks and crafting new tailored communication strategies to help improve inflation dynamics can take time or be difficult to implement. Such interventions are complementary to more traditional monetary policy tightening actions, which will remain key to bringing inflation back to target in a timely manner.

This observation was made in an article on the ""Ethics review of research: Is there a need?"" which was authored by the Chairperson of the Sri Lanka Medical Association's Ethics Review Committee and Professor in Pharmacology at the Sri Jayewardenepura University's Medical Sciences Faculty's Department of Pharmacology, C.A. Wanigatunge, and published in the   Asian Journal of Internal Medicine  's Second Volume's First Issue in February, 2023.   Research, as mentioned in L. Bortolotti and B. Heinrichs's ""Delimiting the concept of research: An ethical perspective"" aims to obtain generalisable knowledge relevant to man by means of a scientifically respectable methodology. Medical progress must therefore include studies that ultimately involve human subjects, but, this goal, as pointed out in the World Medical Association's ""Declaration of Helsinki – Ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects"", should not take precedence over the rights and interests of individuals who take part in such research. Unlike in therapeutic interventions that aim to benefit patients, the functional outcome of research, per J. Wilson and D. Hunter's ""Research exceptionalism"", is to extend or further develop knowledge, and these outcomes are unpredictable. This uncertainty is the fundamental characteristic of research and makes the accurate assessment of the risks and benefits of research, difficult. The benefits of research are mostly to others than those taking the risks of research, and the research participants may directly benefit only at times.   Research that involves human participants, especially when it is medical research, is closely regulated compared to other types of research and is more so when it involves interventions - i.e. clinical trials. This regulation is considered necessary as research involves individuals with rights and interests that may be affected by the activities pertaining to the research. Research regulation occurs through both administrative and ethics related approval prior to the commencement of the research, and the periodic monitoring thereafter, where necessary. However, C. Warlow's ""Over-regulation of clinical research: A threat to public health"" observes that it is often felt that research is overregulated and that this, in turn, is counterproductive, as it tends to discourage researchers. Regulation could also add to the cost of the research which would be significant in low resource settings.   There are many historical examples on exploiting human participants during research and initial guidelines related to research ethics – e.g., the Nuremberg Code and the Belmont Report (Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research, Report of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioural Research) were developed in response to such abuse and resultant scandals. An important measure to reduce such abuse was the introduction of a structured ethics review process where the protocol was reviewed by an independent body. While the older ethical issues appear less now, newer issues have arisen with new developments in science, for example bio banks and data sharing, and these must therefore be addressed with minimal delay in order to avoid harm to research participants. The ethics review of proposed research is only one way of minimising the harm to research participants.   The ethics review of research has expanded globally over the last 50 years and plays an important role in research regulation. In many instances, this is the final hurdle to be cleared before research can commence. Medical research in almost all countries must now undergo a review by an institutional review board (IRB) or an ethics review committee (ERC). The approval by an ERC is also a prerequisite for publication in high impact journals.   In many instances, the issues raised by ERCs during the review process are not unique to research, as the same issues may be seen in day to day life too. However, by virtue of being research, these issues can have a different impact. While risks may only be possible but not definite in any planned research, it is important that steps are taken to reduce their occurrence. Risks become more important when the procedures involved in the research introduce new risks that are not otherwise present.   A key aspect in the ethics review is the evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio. Both the investigators and the ERCs are required to ensure that the risks are appropriately identified, and that measures are instituted to ensure minimal discomfort and harm to the study participants. While even healthy volunteers have suffered critical illness during research due to interventions (""Cytokine storm in a phase one trial of the anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody TGN1412"" by G. Suntharalingam, M.R. Perry, S. Ward, S.J. Brett, A. Castello-Cortes, M.D. Brunner and N. Panoskaltsis), most research that is done both globally and locally carry minimal or moderate risks to the participants. Yet, according to the Council for International Organisations of Medical Sciences' ""International Ethical Guidelines for Health related Research Involving Humans"", the ethics review process remains the same and even if the protocol is presumed to be of minimal risk, it must be evaluated by an independent body in order to ensure a favourable risk-benefit ratio to the participants. Consider for example, questionnaire based knowledge-attitudes-practices studies which are usually considered to be of minimal risk. However, if the questions asked are of a sensitive nature that has the potential to cause distress to the participant, the risk-benefit ratio changes and could vary from moderate to severe. The same applies for audits and would depend on what is being audited and who has access to the data that will be perused. Auditing a registry of human immunodeficiency virus positive patients will carry a different risk-benefit ratio to an audit on medical records to determine the door-to-needle time for thrombolytics at an emergency department. A blanket exception from ethics review for research simply because it is an audit or is questionnaire based, is therefore inappropriate.   Research involving human subjects carries some risk to all research participants, and this risk can vary from minimal to severe. An important aspect in the ethics of risk management is, as observed in H. Hermansson and S.O. Hansson's ""A three party model tool for ethical risk analysis"", whether the person who is subjected to a risk also benefits from that risk. When the participant does not directly benefit from the research but will only help to find generalisable knowledge, minimising such risks becomes more important. Research ethics and a review by an ERC aim to ensure a favourable risk-benefit ratio, and the autonomy of and justice to the study participants. The informed consent process and the ability to withdraw from the research at any time without penalty give participants some control over the risks that they undertake, the quality of the information given and the ability to understand that information plays a major role in this process.   ""Clinical trials and medical care: Defining the therapeutic misconception"" by G.E. Henderson, L.R. Churchill, A.M. Davis, M.M. Easter, C. Grady, S. Joffe, N. Kass, N.M.P. King, C.W. Lidz, F.G. Miller, D.K. Nelson, J. Peppercorn, B.B. Rothschild, P. Sankar, B.S. Wilfond and C.R. Zimmer notes that the difference between research and therapy is an important distinction that must be made as people may at times be unaware that they are participating in research and not being treated for the disease that they have. This therapeutic misconception may cause people to take risks without truly understanding them and in turn violates the autonomy of the research participant as an informed and autonomous decision must be taken to participate in research.   Both the researcher and the ERC must ensure that the information given to participants accurately reflects what will be done during the research and that it is given in a manner that the participants can understand. This highlights the need to submit the information sheets in English and the vernacular of the community involved, for the perusal of the ERC. It is mandatory that all translations are consistent and contain all necessary information regarding the research. The perusal of information sheets, especially those in the vernacular, which is what will be given to the participants, is one method of ensuring the accurate transfer of information to participants in order to enable them to make an informed and autonomous decision. The process of obtaining consent must also be clearly stated in the protocol and must be evaluated by the ERCs so as to ensure that the participants make their decisions voluntarily and without coercion.   While ERCs aim to provide protection against research subjects being harmed, the time spent in getting the ethics related approval prior to commencing research and thereafter for any protocol amendments, is considered too long by many researchers.   The delays in obtaining ERC approval can be multi-factorial. C.A. Wanigatunge, S. Prathapan, G.M. Warnacula and R.S. Tanner's ""Identifying reasons for delays in ethics approval: Experience of an institutional ERC"" which studied reasons for resubmissions to an ERC in Sri Lanka, found that protocol related issues accounted for 66.3% of the instances while issues related to informed consent accounted for 29.5%. The correct methodology is important in order to ensure accurate and generalisable results and the scientific validity of the research. Issues in methodology accounted for 46% of the instances. These could have been easily avoided if the applicants had paid attention to the methodology during the development of the protocol and by ensuring that all the relevant documents were included at the time of the submission.   A major cause for delays, as mentioned in ""Ethics and research governance in a multi-centre study: Add 150 days to your study protocol"" by G. Elwyn, A. Seagrove, K. Thorne and W.Y. Cheung, is the need to get approval from multiple ERCs when research must be conducted at different sites. The need to obtain multiple ERC approvals for the same research can be overcome, as observed by S.J. Winkler, E. Witte and B.E. Bierer in ""The Harvard Catalyst Common Reciprocal IRB Reliance Agreement: An innovative approach to multisite IRB review and oversight"", if there is reciprocity for the ethics related approval given by another. While it happens to a certain extent in Sri Lanka with hospital based ERCs accepting the ethics approval given by the ERCs of medical faculties affiliated to these hospitals, it is done in an ad hoc manner. However, to be effective and mutually acceptable, all ERCs should function at a consistent level in relation to the reviews done. Given the constraints faced by ERCs, especially with regard to the time commitment of the ERC members who perform their functions as additional work from their regular occupations and on a voluntary basis, this is hard to achieve. A way forward is to develop an acceptable method to evaluate and accredit all ERCs in the country that evaluate biomedical research. Of the many ERCs in the country, only nine have undergone an external evaluation process while eight of these are those affiliated to medical faculties.   A major criticism against ERCs is that they assess the scientific validity – i.e. the methodology. Scientific validity is important in order to ensure that the findings are valid and generalisable and therefore will benefit the society at large. Without scientific validity, the research lacks social value and must not be conducted. Many countries have separate research and scientific committees that evaluate the methodology of a protocol, and this would make the work of the ERC easier. In the absence of any other body to ensure scientific rigour, it becomes a task for the ERC to evaluate the methodology and ensure that scarce resources and participants are not exploited. Conducting both scientific and ethical reviews by a single committee, provided the expertise is available to do so, may also reduce the time taken for the review.   Another criticism against ERCs is, per S.J.L. Edwards, T. Stone and T. Swift's ""Differences between research ethics committees"", the differences in the decisions or comments that may be given for the same protocol by different ERCs for protocols that need multi-site approval. Given the plurality of different views represented in an ethics committee and the variety of experience and expertise in considering and identifying ethical issues in research, some of these variations are to be expected. While there are some well known and agreed upon standards in research ethics, there are also many ethical issues where a single agreed upon answer is not possible. The level of expertise and experience of the members of the ERCs will also contribute to differences seen in reviews by different ERCs. These differences may be minimised to a certain extent with the continued training of ERC members and a uniform external evaluation process of all ERCs in the country so as to ensure an appropriate and comparable standard of review.   A major concern for both researchers and the ERCs is when the time spent to review is disproportionate to the risks involved in the proposed study. There are, as mentioned in J. Saunders's ""Research ethics committees - Time for change?"", S.J.L. Edwards and I.R. Omar's ""Ethics review of research: In pursuit of proportionality"" and D. Hunter's ""Proportional ethical review and the identification of ethical issues"", arguments both for and against a proportional ethical review where it is proposed that the ethics review should be proportional to the level of risks represented by the research. While this sounds attractive, this method runs the risk of missing important potential risks that are identified by a discussion between ERC members. Currently, per the Forum for ERCs in Sri Lanka's ""ERC Guidelines: An Operational Guidance for Committees that Review Biomedical Research Proposals"", the ERCs have the option of exempting protocols that do not pose any risks to the participants from review while conducting an expedited review for protocols that carry no more than minimal risks to the participants. However, both these processes must be conducted by the ERCs and not by the researcher as the ethical judgment about his/her project could be clouded by the conflicts of interests that arise by virtue of being the researcher whose objectives would be different to that of the participants. If properly conducted, the expedited reviews will reduce full board reviews of low risk protocols by ERCs but would add to the workload of individual members involved with such expedited review processes. For such processes to be effective, the protocols must identify and address ethical issues correctly and the documentation should be complete at the time of submission to the ERC.   The many arguments against research regulation were widely stated during the recent Covid-19 pandemic. Epidemics and pandemics require rapid answers to hitherto unexpected problems. Research into these questions is essential and is an integral aspect in the management of epidemics. Any delay in finding answers could have catastrophic outcomes. The ERCs adapted to the situation by conducting accelerated and rapid reviews with minimal delays. An accelerated review is done under exceptional circumstances and is identical to the usual full board review where only the usual time taken for the process by the ERCs was reduced. Most delays that occurred during the ethics reviews at these times were due to poorly prepared protocols as the researchers were attempting to conduct studies quickly. Pandemics are no exception to research related rigour, and it is therefore essential to uphold the ethical principles that are practised at other times. Conducting research in these situations is challenging as there is a need to generate knowledge quickly while maintaining public trust and overcoming practical obstacles to implementing research. These challenges need to be carefully balanced with the need to ensure the scientific validity of the research and to uphold ethical principles in its conduct.   Given the conflicts of interests of the researchers that may arise due to their objectives being at variance with those of the participants, the ERCs could act as a vehicle to allow researchers to fulfill their ethical obligations to research participants. The careful planning of the study and discussing the issues with the ERCs, the expedited review of protocols that carry no more than minimal risks to the participants and the reciprocal recognition of the reviews done by similar ERCs can help to minimise much of the delays that can occur during the ERC review processes. A laissez faire attitude to ethics review must not be the answer, Wanigatunge concluded.  ",TRUE,CIZLop1eNQgLt0ggozjxXC5H1Zm1,Wasantha Warnakulasuriya,0,"The regulation of research by way of administrative activities or ethical review should not, according to ethicists, be a barrier for conducting good quality research that provides generalisable knowledge which will benefit people.

Consultant Paediatrician at the Lady Ridgeway Children’s Hospital (LRH) Deepal Perera, speaking to   The Daily Morning,   said yesterday (26) that the children with chronic cough should immediately consult a doctor and go for a check-up as the tuberculosis is commonly reported among the children in Sri Lanka.    Perera said that although about 300 tuberculosis patients are reported per year and sometimes it may not be the actual number of patients.    “There are about 300 children who have contracted tuberculosis are reported annually. The statistics had gone down as we could not do tuberculosis testing during the Covid-19 pandemic. The main reason for this rapid increase in the number of patients is the unawareness existing in the society. Most people think that this chronic cough is a symptom of Wheeze. So they refuse to go for required check-ups just using inhalers as a temporary relief,” he said.    Dr. Perera also noted that the parents must be more aware and act responsibly to take their children to a doctor if they have a chronic cough continuously.    “On the other hand, parents should be more concerned about their children if anyone in the family has had tuberculosis in the past. This history should not be concealed from the doctor as it is very important to identify a disease like tuberculosis. It is better to go for a doctor at the very first time you get symptoms as it is treatable,” he said.    When contacted by The Daily Morning   yesterday, spokesperson of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe said that it is the responsibility of the Ministry of Health (MOH) to give the priority to prevent such public health issues even though there is a health crisis at present.    He also emphasised that not only the Government but also the public have a huge responsibility to protect children from tuberculosis.    “As we know there is a social stigma related to tuberculosis which prevents people from consulting doctors. But it leads to a huge crisis. Usually, during Avurudu and Vesak seasons public gatherings become a common scenario. Underprivileged social communities, people living in highly populated areas, people with low immunity level have been identified as groups with a high risk.    Therefore children living in such groups should be given more attention by the relevant authorities,” he noted.    Several attempts made by The Daily Morning   to contact the Minister of Health and Director General of Health Services on this matter proved futile.

Speaking to   The Sunday Morning Business  , Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF) Secretary General Yohan Lawrence explained that the primary reason for the industry’s current difficulties was the downturn in global markets.    As such, he clarified that the Government’s ability to intervene in this aspect was limited. “The reason the sector is struggling is because markets are down. It’s not something that the Government can do anything about, in that respect. It’s not because demand is low. Right now, unfortunately, there’s nothing that anyone can do about it,” Lawrence stated.   With market demand experiencing a decline, the industry faces significant challenges in exploring immediate alternatives.    “Unfortunately, when market demand is down, it’s a little difficult to look at an alternative because if the demand for apparel is down, there’s nothing we can do. That’s why companies are going to have to re-look at how they operate and see how they can manage through this difficult time,” he added.   Despite the current setbacks, industry leaders remain hopeful of the apparel sector’s resilience and recovery. However, Lawrence acknowledged that innovative strategies and operational adjustments would be crucial to navigating these tough times.    Lawrence emphasised the importance of businesses revisiting their operational models and exploring novel approaches in order to adapt to the changing market landscape.   While the Government’s direct intervention may be limited in addressing market fluctuations, there is a consensus that collaborative efforts between the private sector and policymakers will play a crucial role in supporting the industry during this challenging phase. The Government can provide an enabling environment by implementing policy measures that enhance the competitiveness of Sri Lanka’s apparel industry on the global stage.      Drop in major export markets       Meanwhile, speaking to   The Sunday Morning Business  , Export Development Board (EDB) Chairman Dr. Kingsley Bernard stated that the main export markets for Sri Lankan apparel products were the US, the UK, and the EU.    “All these markets are now facing economic downturns, raising logistics and energy costs. Therefore, consumers are more cautious about discretionary spending on clothing while prioritising other essential necessities. When comparing the export statistics of the first five months of 2023 with 2022, there has been a 16% drop in apparel products from Sri Lanka.”   Bernard added that US imports of textiles and apparel had continued to decrease in value terms, falling by 22.6% to $ 42 billion in the first five months of 2023, compared to $ 55 billion during the same period in 2022, where Sri Lankan apparel exports to the US dropped by 23% during the first five months of 2022.   According to him, the European Union’s apparel imports suffered a decline in the first two months of 2023, dropping by $ 322 million or 2%, compared to the same period in 2022. Sri Lankan apparel exports to the EU have dropped by 16% during the first two months of 2023. While the weak Euro and the fall of Sterling were the main reasons behind the decline in apparel imports into the EU, the increase in unit prices also negatively impacted EU imports.       Government action       Bernard stated that the Government was taking action through several activities to support the apparel industry.    “Under the Indo-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ISFTA), there is only a quota of eight million pieces of apparel, which will be fully utilised in 2023. If Sri Lanka could penetrate the Indian market, even 10% would be equivalent to 100 million people.”   He added that considering the current situation in the country and also to ensure job security of apparel workers, the Government was discussing with the Indian Government on increasing the quota to $ 500 million, getting unlimited duty free access to the Indian market under the ISFTA, or getting unlimited duty free access at least for a period of one year for apparel products made out of Indian fabric.    According to him, these matters will be discussed during the President’s visit to India.    Bernard listed the following as measures being taken by the Government:      EU GSP+ facility under the new EU GSP scheme   The Government is making arrangements to obtain a GSP+ facility until 2034. The GSP+ facility is granted only for garments made out of fabric manufactured locally or imported from EU countries and the SAARC region. Therefore, the Government is making arrangements to resubmit a request to grant approval for garments made out of Indonesian fabric to export to EU countries with GSP Plus concessions under the cross-regional cumulation mechanism.      Establishment of Eravur fabric park   The apparel industry is heavily dependent on imported fabric, which is a barrier to obtaining concessions under EU GSP+ and UK DCTS. Considering this, the Government has made arrangements to establish a fabric manufacturing park under the Board of Investment.       Expedite the China FTA    The Government is taking actions to expedite the China Free Trade Agreement (FTA). In the meantime, it is also exploring the possibility of gaining access to an exit processing mechanism for the apparel sector, where Chinese raw materials could be reprocessed and exported as apparel products to China, where duty is charged only on the value added in Sri Lanka.      Commenting about the alternatives that the EDB is looking at in order to improve the sector, Bernard stated that a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) had been signed with the Swiss Import Promotion Programme (SIPPO), which operates under the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) of Switzerland, on 22 December 2022.    Accordingly, SIPPO conducted a market study to identify the trade structure, distribution channels, consumption patterns, and opportunities in the Swiss and European markets for Sri Lanka’s value-added textiles and apparel. The EDB organised a webinar in collaboration with SIPPO to disseminate its findings to the industry.    “Considering the current situation in the apparel industry, the EDB, in collaboration with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, organised a meeting with Sri Lankan missions overseas. At the meeting, it was proposed to carry out the following activities for the years 2023/2024. Also, we are planning to organise B2B meetings in Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Russia, the Middle East, and South Africa to link identified buyers with Sri Lankan apparel companies.”   Further, the EDB, in collaboration with the Sri Lankan Embassy in Brussels, Belgium, is organising a briefing session on the EU strategy on sustainable and circular textiles for the Sri Lankan apparel industry. The resource person for the session is from the Textile Unit of the European Commission.

This was a political and moral position that was concretised in the slogans that demanded that Rajapaksa and the 225 Parliamentarians go home. “Go home Gota” was a slogan that spanned the length and breadth of the country even if many people did not know what was being meant by a “system change.” It was an implied call for fresh Elections that would give rise to a new Government with new Members with a people’s mandate. Other top slogans of that time was the bid to get corruption outlawed in view of the damage that it had done.      Unfortunately, none of the constructive demands of the protest movement for elections and for accountability have come to pass. There have neither been Local Government Elections to give any idea of the present mandate of the people, nor has there been the slightest practice of accountability or restraint in the practice of corruption. The issue of corruption has come into the open again on the issue of the nitric acid carrying container Ship, the MV X-Press Pearl, which caught fire in the Sri Lankan seas causing immense destruction to the environment and the livelihood of the fishing community.      As reported in the media, Justice Minister, President’s Counsel Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has already made a disturbing revelation regarding the transfer of United States Dollars ($) 250 million to the foreign account of a Sri Lankan as a bribe to obstruct the legal process related to the MV X-Press Pearl disaster, and has directed the Police to initiate investigations into it. The Minister has named the Sri Lankan involved and will await further details from the probe. The indications are that the $ 7 billion compensation would be only a mirage. No one would be charged for negligence as in many cases.      Accountability absent    The continuing tragedy of the present time, which was articulated by the now suppressed protest movement, is that there is no accountability for those in positions of power. The imposing of discipline on those lower in the rungs is to be seen in the manner in which the Government is dealing with the economic crisis. The Government’s agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been at the cost of high taxes and job cuts imposed on the masses. The costs of this economic restructuring are falling heavily, if not disproportionately, on those who are middle class and below. Fixed income earners are particularly affected as they bear a double burden in being taxed at higher levels at a time when the cost of living has soared. It is these tax monies that will go to repay the enormous debts incurred by white elephant projects such as the National Airline (SriLankan Airlines) and Mattala, the Airport in the area of a wildlife sanctuary.      The Government’s clarion call for the restructuring and sale of State owned enterprises is being projected as evidence of the statesmanship and vision of the political leaders. The public service is vastly overstaffed and Government managed businesses are making gigantic losses. But, it is unfair and immoral to place the blame on the workers who were employed there in large numbers to satisfy the patronage related needs of political leaders. The political debate has been turned on its head. It is not about holding those political leaders accountable for the economic crimes of mismanagement that they have perpetrated, but about the workers that they hired, who voted for them in gratitude, that there are too many of them now and that they are overpaid in relation to the work that they do.      The other missing dimension in the current debate about restructuring the economy and getting it out of the rut is the absence of any effort to ensure accountability for past economic mismanagement and corruption, indeed for the looting that took place in the economy. The Government has not held those political leaders accountable. Instead, it has shown solicitude for the sufferings and pain of mind suffered when their houses were attacked and burned during the height of the protests. Such solicitude can be appreciated, but it needs to be consistent across the board. The different treatment given to politicians as compared to ordinary citizens would rankle within those large numbers of citizens who lost their properties too, during the war, terrorism and riots of the past, but only received meagre compensation if at all from successive Governments.      Unrealisable dream    The Government’s unwillingness, perhaps inability, to deal with the issues of corruption goes back to its roots. The Government, and the President (Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policies Ranil Wickremesinghe), continue to be beholden to the majority in the Parliament for their continuation. The tragedy is that this Governmental approach will doom Sri Lanka to the shallows, where it has been languishing for at least four decades. The Government needs to form a coalition with the Opposition MPs in the Parliament, in order to ensure accountability and reform, if it is genuine about it. Some Government Members have started to talk about forming a National Government. If this is to be done, it should be based on clear objectives, including pursuing corruption related cases, and should be an effort at genuine power sharing. The desire to stay on in power must not take precedence over dealing with corruption and holding those guilty of crimes accountable.       The economic mismanagement, looting and Ponzi schemes whereby successive Governments borrow to repay old loans need to change if Sri Lanka is to take off into the rapid economic growth that its’ people yearn for. It is not the people who should be blamed but the leaders who are dishonest and corrupt, and who continue to be so. A leading think tank, Verite Research has highlighted that the Government has failed to fulfill its commitments to accountability and transparency. 'The IMF Tracker', a new online tool launched by Verité Research, has shown that Sri Lanka had met 25% of the trackable programme related commitments of the IMF programme as at the end of March, 2023, but that it had failed on one.        Verite Research said: “The failed commitment is the establishment of an online based transparency platform. This platform is expected to publish, on a semi-annual basis, information related to (i) all significant public procurement contracts, (ii) a list of all firms receiving tax exemptions through the Board of Investment, and (iii) a list of individuals and firms receiving tax exemptions on luxury vehicle imports. It was due by 1 March, 2023, but had not been met even by the end of that month.” It noted that timely progress on the IMF programme has two benefits. First, there are the material benefits that can result from many of the actions. Second, it can improve confidence in Sri Lanka’s governance, which then helps negotiations to restructure the burden of past debt and to speed up the path to future economic recovery.  The missing ingredients so far are honesty, transparency and the desire to take everyone on this journey.      (The writer is the Executive Director of the National Peace Council.)

She graduated from the University of the Arts’ London College of Fashion, and runs a fashion label called HIRUSHI.    Your clothing line was featured in the October 2022 print issue of British Vogue. Tell us more about this.   I was extremely grateful and excited when the editor at Vogue approached me about this opportunity. I was approached by an editor who works for Vogue at a fashion event I was part of in London.    Tell us about the brands you’ve worked with.   I have worked for luxury brands including Giles Deacon, Mary Katrantzou, The London Embroidery Studio, and Nichole de Carle London. I have worked on private commissions for brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, Savage X Fenty by Rihanna, Ralph Lauren, and SKIMS by Kim Kardashian.    As a brand, how does HIRUSHI promote ethical labour, craftsmanship, and sustainable production?   Each product is designed in-house by hand emphasising the value of sustainable and original design. As a brand, we take steps to follow the no-waste policy and circular design strategies aiming to reduce our impact on the planet. We believe that quality plays an important role in the sustainability of this industry, and for this reason, our products are ethically manufactured to last a lifetime.   Tell us about the brands you have collaborated with.   I haven’t collaborated with many brands so far; most of my work is independent. I have either worked for international designers or my work has been featured in magazines.   However, there was an advertisement from TRESemme Sri Lanka which was a collaboration. It featured the new TRESemme Sulphate Free Colour Protect in 2022.    How do you stay up-to-date with fashion?   As a designer, you’ve always got to push yourself forward; you’ve always got to keep up with the trends or make your own trends. Researching constantly is how I stay updated on current trends. I get bored very easily so trying out new things and constant change keeps me moving forward.   What is the biggest lesson that you have learnt since you started your own line of clothing?   What I’ve learnt is that if you want to remain in the industry, you need to keep on creating and making your own identity – create a trademark – as a designer.   What was the main inspiration behind your latest collection?   My latest collection was for Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week 2022 which took place this December. It was titled ‘Enchanted Garden’.    I presented a collection of sumptuous embellishments and hand embroidery of floral beauty. Inspired by garden botanicas and experimental photography of flowers taken by me, this collection speaks of care and awareness of the environment and our love for nature. It also celebrates conscious femininity. It depicts a passionate independent woman comforted by nature and its changing seasons. Putting sustainability at the core, the lineup opened with 100% hand-embroidered and hand-painted garments, which then gradually deepened into florals and hand-embroidered silhouettes, followed by eco-friendly and hand-printed silks, and finished with natural embroidered linen dresses.   A series of dresses bathed in colour – from mustard to blues, to yellows and botanical prints – radiates the beauty of nature and gives out a message of environmental commitment. I combined a harmonic balance by using a mixture of traditional and modern contemporary couture embroidery.       What’s one piece of advice you can give aspiring designers out there?   Keep creating and keep up with the trends. Be open to negative and positive feedback, this will expand your knowledge and self-growth as a designer.

Whether they contribute to uphold democracy, represent the public’s interests and ensure the proper functioning of the State’s affairs, as they are required to, has long been in question. It is no secret that the public faith in many members of Parliament has greatly dwindled. The same concerns were raised in the controversial situation surrounding the Local Government (LG) election. On the one hand, the Government’s failure, or unwillingness to extend the necessary support to conduct the election raises concerns about the extent to which they respect the public’s sovereignty. On the other hand, the fact that the Government appears to have prioritised its own wellbeing over the needs of the public while requesting the taxpayer to tighten their belts further, underlines what the government sees as priority.     It is in such context that concerns were raised about the roles, powers, and objectives of the three pillars of democracy, i.e. the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary. That was, after Attorney-at-Law MP Premanath C. Dolawatte criticised and questioned the impartiality of the interim order issued by the Supreme Court (SC) with regard to releasing funds for the LG election, and went on to claim that the stated interim order breaches Parliamentary privileges. Meanwhile, State Minister Shehan Semasinghe had requested the Deputy Speaker to advise the relevant authorities to refrain from taking any action on the SC’s interim order until the Parliamentary Committee on Privileges concludes its inquiries with regard to the privileges-related concerns raised by MP Dolawatte. The duo came under fire from a number of parties including the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) that viewed their statements as amounting to contempt of Court.     The two MPs’ conduct in this regard is far from what is expected from MPs. They both have responsibilities as law-makers, while Dolawatta is also a lawyer. They should know that there are more effective and suitable ways of challenging a Court’s decision, if that is necessary, and that attempting to use – or misuse – Parliamentary privileges to cover up their politically-motivated actions against the Judiciary’s discretion is not a good precedent to set. This is not just a matter of MPs believing that they are, or that they should be, exempted from the laws that apply to ordinary citizens. This is a matter of MPs believing that they are above another pillar of democracy. This indicates a rift between the connection the Legislature, and the Judiciary must have as two of the three pillars of democracy. Further, the comments signal a challenge to the Judiciary’s independence.    At the same time, we cannot ignore the fact that this entire debate is about the LG election, which is expected to give the public the opportunity to elect public representatives that represent their interests. Therefore, this is a challenge to democracy in more than one way. In fact, these concerns about the MPs’ role and influence in the context of democracy have intensified over the past few months, because the public have been awaiting an opportunity to re-elect their representatives since the “aragalaya” (the struggle) protests and their enthusiasm has not ebbed away due to the postponement of the LG election.    Sri Lanka has, on several occasions, enforced the law against MPs that have been in contempt of Court, and it should not be any different this time. The two MPs’ actions should not be ignored, and appropriate actions should be taken against them by the Speaker of the House and the Government.

Speaking to   The Morning  , he said: “It seems to me that there is still not enough dollars to import drugs. That is the main reason which has caused the shortage of drugs. The Government is releasing a very small amount of dollars from time to time to import drugs. It is not possible to import them in that way. That is because certain drug companies start manufacturing drugs only when we place the order and make the relevant payment. We cannot import drugs as if we are visiting a pharmacy to purchase them.”   Pointing out that the relevant authorities including the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka should immediately declare the amount of dollars allocated for the import of drugs during the past 12 months, he said that the necessary foreign exchange should be allocated on a priority basis. If sufficient allocations are not made within a few weeks, he said that the entire health sector will collapse as the country is already seeing a serious shortage of drugs.   “The Government is depending on donations and various other assistance with regard to drugs. That is not a solution to this issue at all. Usually, those who make donations donate what they can, and not what we want. Some countries donate to us certain drugs that are in surplus in those countries, but that drug may not be the one which we are most in need of. The only solution is that there should be enough dollars to purchase and import what the country needs. This issue should be addressed as soon as possible,” added Prof. Jayasumana.   Speaking at a recent media briefing, the All-Ceylon Medical Officers’ Association Secretary Dr. Jayantha Bandara said that nearly three million people receiving treatment for non-communicable diseases, one million people suffering from preventable blindness, 10,000 patients on pending lists to undergo bypass surgeries, and 10,000 cancer patients are currently seriously affected due to the prevailing shortage of pharmaceutical drugs and medical equipment in the country.   Furthermore, College of Medical Laboratory Science President Ravi Kumudesh also said last week that there is a shortage of about 185 pharmaceutical drugs at present, a figure which previously stood at about 90. Warning that it may even become 250 in time to come, he said that the Government and the Ministry of Health should appoint a technical committee to look into the issue and take necessary steps.   As the country is experiencing a serious economic crisis at present, the relevant authorities have, over the past few months, been finding it difficult to obtain the required foreign currency to import pharmaceutical drugs and other medical supplies. Although the situation has subsided to a certain extent due to the various grants and donations received from several organisations and countries, the hospitals are still affected by the shortages of drugs and medical equipment. However, the Health Ministry has been stating over the recent past that the shortage of drugs and medical equipment is not at a serious level, and that the provision of treatment can be managed.

The CBSL Chief stated that an extended bank holiday was declared from 29 June to 3 July 2023, including 30 June, in order to obtain the necessary time required for the restructuring of domestic debt of Sri Lanka.    “The main reason for announcing a bank holiday on 30 June was to ensure a sufficient number of days for the domestic debt optimisation strategy that has been discussed with the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance”, he said.    Furthermore, Dr. Weerasinghe emphasised that the strategy will require approval from the Cabinet of Ministers and committees in Parliament as well as be subjected to Parliament debates prior to implementation –  a process, he said, that will require approximately four days at the very least.    “During the specified dates, the debt market and the economy market should not function because their information is very market sensitive, as public discussion of these proposals could affect the markets,” he added.    In addition, the CBSL Chief also mentioned that although 30 June has been declared a bank holiday, all banking activities that can be done during the period, regardless of whether banks are physically open, will be carried out as usual.    “For example, internet banking services, ATM withdrawals, and fund transfers on accounts that can be done regardless of whether banks are physically open (can be carried out)”, he said.    Meanwhile, Dr. Weerasinghe assured that there will be no reduction in bank deposits in commercial banks and non-banking institutions, adding that there will be no reduction in interest rates currently being received in terms of contracts the banks as well.    “If the banks have agreed to provide a certain interest rate, they will continue to be received by the deposit holders. They will not be affected adversely in any way by the domestic debt optimisation strategy”, he asserted.    On 23 June, the Government declared a special bank holiday on 30 June 2023.    This was announced in a special gazette notification issued by Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena in his capacity as the Minister of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government.    The special bank holiday was declared under Section 10(1) of the Holidays Act, No. 29 of 1971.

In a recent post on social media, Hettige has referred to a recent statement that one of MR’s sons had created the tag ‘GotaGo,’ stating that it was a time bomb that had fallen on the Rajapaksa family.   After praising MR as the signet of Rajapaksa politics and the light of the Rajapaksa family, Hettige has stated: “Where it went wrong was by failing to differentiate politics and governing a state as two different things. Family relatives were taken into politics and governance in an undesirable manner, or else it was allowed to happen. Therefore, the people’s attraction, love, and respect enjoyed by him (MR) started to dissolve like an iceberg. He lost a lot of true long-time friends as a result.”   “After Gotabaya became President, the situation became more complicated. Viyathmaga exploded and governance took an abnormal shape, as President Gotabaya also strengthened the relatives’ circle. Although he managed to get the power, he did not have the brain power to retain that power. He did not take what was to be learnt from his brother Mahinda,” he has further stated.   “Gotabaya earned the wrath of the people very fast since he did not understand politics and worked in a short-sighted manner. Although he thought of doing good to the country, he did not get that opportunity. Everyone knows the fate that befell him at the end,” Hettige has added.   The failures of the Rajapaksa Government have also been listed out in point form by the former Coordinating Secretary – misunderstanding popularity, selfishness, losing sight due to power, thinking that power would last forever, losing longstanding friends, and engaging relatives in work in an undue manner. “These are the reasons for the decline of the Rajapaksas.

Don’t let life leave you,opinion," With the approval of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which is due on 20 March, Sri Lankan exporters will receive foreign exchange on a priority basis, said the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe.   Speaking during a televised political talk show, he said: “ Some $ 400 million is expected as the first tranche of the IMF bailout. The exporters have been complaining that they could not source raw materials for their industries as they are short of dollars. The Government and certain industries were badly hit by this shortfall. Recently, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) of the World Bank Group provided $ 400 million to three local private banks. In addition, the appreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee followed the inflow of $ 500 million into local banks, thereby adding to the foreign exchange liquidity of the country. The tourism sector and foreign remittances have also shown an increase when compared to the earnings of the same period last year (2022).”   The Governor also stated that after clearing the IMF hurdle, the country should boldly face the changes necessary to bring the economy back. “There may be temporary hardships, but we have to stick to the requirements if we are to maintain essential services for the public.

A special meeting was held on Tuesday (9) to discuss issues pertaining to eggs, and it was attended by representatives of the Egg Producers' Association, the Ministries of Trade, Commerce and Food Security, and Agriculture, the State Ministry of Livestock Development, the Consumer Affairs Authority, the Department of Animal Production and Health, and the Customs.     During the discussion, it has been revealed that the country's daily requirement of eggs is seven million, but that the daily production of eggs is only 5.2 million eggs. As there is a shortage of more than one million eggs, the Egg Producers' Association has pointed out that there is no issue in continuing with importing eggs.     However, officials of the Trade, Commerce and Food Security Ministry have said that there would be no need to import eggs by the end of this year (2023) as the production of eggs would reach higher levels by then. The appointment of an all party committee to look into issues pertaining to the egg requirement and increasing local egg production has also been suggested during the meeting.     Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera, who had convened the meeting, said that a joint programme should be launched to resolve the egg shortage and increase local egg production.     The Agriculture Ministry's Media Director, Dharma Wanninayake told  The Daily Morning   that several decisions such as directing the relevant authorities to obtain samples of imported eggs so as to release such from the Customs within a day’s time, working to issue rice for animal feed production, making a decision regarding the lifting of the maximum retail price (MRP) on eggs after further studies, the further issuance of imported eggs only for the bakery industry, and the implementation of the recommendations made by the Animal Production and Health Department to prevent bird flu from entering the country, had been taken during the meeting.      A shortage of eggs emerged in the country as a result of the steep rise in the price of eggs, and the Government decided to impose a MRP on eggs, and import eggs with the intention of bringing this situation under control. The State Trading (General) Corporation is tasked with importing eggs for the bakery industry, while the imposition of a MRP on eggs saw opposition from several parties including egg producers. It was recently revealed that a total of 277,360 kg of eggs, which amounts to 4.3 million eggs, had been imported from 13 February 2023 to date.

Speaking at the weekly Cabinet briefing yesterday (28), the Minister said that despite requests from various parties to reduce interest rates, the Cabinet has no power to take action on the matter as the interest rates are decided by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank.   He noted that during discussions with the Sri Lanka Government, the IMF wanted the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to hike policy rates by 250 bps higher than the currently maintained levels, “but the Sri Lankan officials attending the discussions did not agree to it,” he added.   Since April 2022, the Central Bank has increased policy rates by a total of 800 bps, where the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) has increased from 6.50% to 14.50% while the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) was raised from 7.50% to 15.50%.   Gunawardana said that since the Central Bank has tied the policy rates to the inflation rates the country witnessed in the past months, policy rates should come down to bring the bank interest rates down.   As of last week, the Average Weighted Prime Lending Rate (AWPR) of Licenced Commercial Banks were at 24.21%.

Moreover, they predict that there is a 35% possibility of policy rates being relaxed by 25 bps and a 15% probability for a rate cut of 50 bps in order to prevent a major economic downturn as well as to signal the market participants a clear direction on the way ahead.    “Also, considering the persistent improvement in liquidity in the banking system, we assigned a higher probability of 90% on the SRR to remain unchanged,” First Captial noted.

A total of 28% of the world’s population, approximately two billion people, experienced extreme levels of repression.   In Sri Lanka, where the civic space is rated as “obstructed” in 2022, a systematic crackdown on protests as the country suffers its worst economic crisis in decades, the arrest and harassment of activists as well as the targeting of journalists, were documented. Protests were restricted and disrupted and an excessive use of force was documented through the year. Hundreds were arbitrarily arrested and there have also been incidents of torture or ill treatment in detention, including the denial of access to medical care and lawyers. The use of excessive force by the Police against protestors, including the use of water cannons, tear gas and rubber bullets, was documented. Barricades were placed at various places, around which they had large spikes attached to them. The authorities also used state of emergency based regulations to curtail protests and shut down social media networks. Pro-Government mobs were also unleashed to attack protestors and protest sites with impunity. In July 2022, a coordinated joint operation by the Sri Lankan military, the Police and the Special Task Force forcibly removed parts of the three-month-long “Gotagogama” rolling peaceful protest site in front of the Presidential Secretariat in Galle Face, Colombo. The security forces severely beat protestors and lawyers and removed many tents from the pavement. At least 50 people were injured. In August 2022, three activists were detained under the draconian Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act (PTA). Protesting Tamil families of the disappeared have continued to face disruption as well as verbal, physical, and serious psychological harassment from the security forces. Human rights defenders and activists were arrested, detained or banned from travel. In February, 2022, activist Shehan Malaka Gamage who has been advocating for truth and justice in relation to the Easter Sunday attacks, was arbitrarily arrested and subsequently released on bail. In the same month, the Foreign Affairs Ministry issued a statement which amounted to harassment and intimidation against leading human rights lawyer Ambika Satkunanathan. In April 2022, youth activist Thisara Anuruddha Bandara who actively promoted the #GoHomeGota social media campaign which was used widely during the protest, was picked up at his home in an abduction style arrest. In May 2022, Catholic priest Amila Jeewantha Peiris, who was an active member of the GotaGoGama protest movement, and six others who supported the peaceful protest, were banned from travelling abroad. Leading protestor Dhaniz Ali was arrested by the Police while trying to leave for Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on a flight in July 2022, while in August 2022, human rights defender and General Secretary of the Ceylon Teachers Union Joseph Stalin was arrested at his office. In September 2022, the National Organiser of Youth for Change Lahiru Weerasekera was arrested by the Police as he was returning from a peaceful protest at the Galle Face. Human rights lawyer Hejaaz Hizbullah continues to face trial on trumped up charges. Journalists have also been targeted. Sri Lankan journalist Chamuditha Samarawickrama was attacked by unidentified armed men in February 2022. In April 2022, eight journalists who were covering the protests were allegedly assaulted by the security forces. Six journalists were accused of violating Section 120 of the Penal Code (exciting or attempting to excite disaffection). In June 2022, journalist and media rights campaigner Tharindu Uduwaragedara was served a notice requiring him to appear at the Criminal Investigations Department in Colombo for an inquiry. In September 2022, journalists based in the Eastern City of Batticaloa, Balasingham Krishnakumar and Selvakumar Nilanthan, were ordered to report to the headquarters of the Counter-Terrorism Investigation Division in Colombo for questioning.   Three countries or territories have been downgraded from “repressed” to “closed”, which is the worst rating. Afghanistan has been downgraded due to the severe restrictions on civic space by the Taliban following their takeover in 2021. Activists and journalists have been arrested, detained and even tortured. Women’s rights activists protesting discriminatory policies on education and employment have been met by restrictions and violence. The Taliban has also clamped down on civil society organisations. Another country that has been downgraded is Myanmar. Two years on from the coup, thousands of activists and anti-coup protestors have been jailed by the military junta’s secret military tribunals on fabricated charges. The junta has continued to torture detainees with impunity and four activists were executed in July 2022. Scores of journalists have also been detained while media outlets have been banned. In October 2022, the junta enacted a new non-Governmental organisation related law that will further shackle what is left of the civil society.   Hong Kong has also been downgraded due to the systematic crackdown on dissent following the passage of the draconian National Security Law in 2020. More than 200 individuals have been arrested under the Security Law and dozens of civil society groups and trade unions have disbanded or relocated since the Law came into place. Activists have also been criminalised on sedition related charges. Independent media outlets have also been targeted with raids and forced to close and journalists have been criminalised.   “The regression of civic space across the Asian region is reaching alarming levels. Most people in the region are living in countries with closed or repressed civic space where their freedoms to speak up, organise or mobilise are under attack on a daily basis. The downgrading of Afghanistan, Myanmar and Hong Kong’s civic space rating this year to “closed”, highlights how authoritarian States are increasingly gaining ground and the critical need to support activists and the civil society of these countries who are pushing back against these repressive regimes,” said Asia Pacific Researcher for CIVICUS, Josef Benedict.   In Asia, the top civic violation documented in 2022 is the use and enactment of restrictive legislation in 23 countries, as Governments used the criminal justice system to muzzle dissent. Among the legislation most often used to stifle dissent include laws related to national security and anti-terrorism, public order and criminal defamation. Human rights defenders were prosecuted in at least 17 countries in the region.   As Chinese President Xi Jinping sought an unprecedented third term in office, China detained and prosecuted scores of human rights defenders in 2022 for broadly defined and vaguely worded offences such as “subverting State power”, “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” or “disturbing public order”. Restrictive laws such as “abusing democratic freedoms” or “spreading materials against the State” were also used in Vietnam to keep more than a hundred activists in jail. Thailand continued to prosecute critics for royal defamation (lese-majeste) while in Cambodia, incitement provisions were used to criminalise activists and union leaders. In Indonesia, the Electronic Information and Transactions Law was weaponised to silence online dissent. In India, anti-terror laws such as the repressive Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act have been systematically used by the Government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to keep activists in detention. In Pakistan, the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act was used against journalists and critics to criminalise online defamation.   Another top violation in Asia was the disruption of protests which occurred in 20 countries. In at least 18 countries, the detention of protestors was documented.   Unprecedented protests that erupted across China in December 2022, due to widespread public frustration with their Zero-Covid-19 policy, lockdowns and other issues, which were met with restrictions, arrests and the use of excessive force. In Cambodia, striking unionists from the NagaWorld Casino that held regular protests were detained while riot police also used violent tactics in Thailand to disperse peaceful protestors including around the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit In Indonesia, and mass protests by Papuans against the Central Government’s policies and in support of independence were forcibly dispersed with the unnecessary use of force.   The authorities also deployed various other tactics to silence dissent in the region. In at least 17 countries in Asia, the harassment of activists, journalists and critics was reported. In the Philippines, activists continue to be red-tagged and then arrested on fabricated charges. Activists and lawyers in Singapore faced police harassment for their activism against the death penalty. In India, the Government sought to block activists and journalists from travelling abroad   “As authoritarian States sought to stay in power and silence all forms of dissent, it weaponised an array of restrictive laws to persecute activists. When people began to mobilise on the streets against repression, they were met with excessive and even deadly force. Governments also resorted to other extra legal tactics to harass activists including digital attacks, smear campaigns or travel bans. Despite this, the civil societies in many parts of the region have continued to fight back and use innovative ways to demand their rights,” added Benedict.   Countries of concern in the region include Bangladesh and Cambodia. In Cambodia, repressive laws are routinely misused to restrict civic freedoms and criminalise critical voices. Prime Minister Hun Sen has also intensified his crackdown on the political opposition ahead of elections in July 2023.   Despite these threats to civic freedoms, there are some positive developments. In Thailand, after many years of campaigning, the authorities formally charged a former senior park ranger and three subordinates suspected of killing an ethnic Karen activist, while In Indonesia, after years of advocacy by activists and victims groups, the Government finally acknowledged serious human rights violations from the past. In India, the Supreme Court ordered the suspension of the use of the sedition law which has been used as a tool to silence dissent while in Sri Lanka, mass protests led to the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa who oversaw a climate of repression against activists, journalists and critics.

The Morning Sports   spoke to Illyas about the current issues with Sri Lanka Rugby and the state of sports in general in the country.    Excerpts from the interview are reproduced below:      What is your stance on the Minister’s decision regarding your suspension, which was based on the Asia Rugby suspension handed to you earlier?    The Minister, or any reasonably thinking person, should look into and support the president of a union. Suspension without an inquiry is unacceptable. In this case, the Asia Rugby Chairman is former SLR President Asanga Seneviratne, who is instrumental in the continuous suspension of SLR even after the court gave the interim order.    Together with the Minister, Seneviratne and the Asia Rugby President are doing their best to punish SLR and myself for no reason. As you may see, they continue to fail at this, over and over again.       The rugby fraternity blames you for not securing the Dialog sponsorship. What are your comments on that?    The SLR sponsorship is like a saloon door; it swings both ways. However, the SLR council looks into securing the best deals, and certain decisions have to be made. The only people who are worried and crying foul about the Dialog issue are the two past SLR presidents.    Even with such a huge sponsorship from Dialog, I inherited a debt of Rs. 56 million, which they both left behind. SLR will have a meeting with all stakeholders to bring about a resolution so that the past presidents would be answerable, and they will not be allowed to hold any post with SLR herewith owing to their bad financial mismanagement.       The Minister has now made several changes to the SLR constitution. Are you aware of these?       If you take the existing SLR constitution, the proposed constitution is almost a copy. The only new additions are regarding dual citizenship and the age cap.       The state of national rugby had declined dramatically during your term in office. Why do you think this is?    Consider where Fiji and England are in the World Series standings. Does that mean that their rugby has declined? All countries go through highs and lows, but for SLR rugby, from the time that we have been in power, there has been a significant amount of political interference, backed by previous SLR presidents.    They initially sabotaged the local sevens by not allowing the best players to be in the national pool, and taking away our sponsors Dialog and placing them with Asia Rugby. They also tried to put in an advisory committee recommended by the Asia Rugby President. This recommendation was made without even notifying the SLR members’ union.    Another political drama was the Gazette suspending SLR, which cut off our financial support and high-performance training. All these factors contributed to the decline of SLR. Ministers and ex-SLR presidents should not interfere in the affairs of SLR. The people who are elected through a democratic process have the knowledge and capability to run rugby locally and internationally.    For the last 10 years, under the last two SLR presidents and now myself, the Sri Lanka sevens team has been between No. 2 and No. 7 in Asia’s rankings, and as an average we are fourth or fifth. The last two presidents, especially Asanga Seneviratna, spent enormous amounts of sponsorship money and incurred borrowings.    When he was driven out of the SLR by the provincial unions, we were in fifth place. It’s the same with Lasitha Gunaratne. No one built a professional sevens high-performance squad in Sri Lanka. The sevens and fifteens players are in both squads, and these players are not released for national training during the league.    The issue is the previous minister, who said that he has sports in his blood, but suspended the sport that he dearly loved before he went off. The sport is suffering now, as Asia Rugby has asked that the gazette be revoked. The current minister is unable to do this, and as birds of a feather flock together, they want me to resign or find some way to remove me illegally.    You don’t need advisors or rocket science to sort out the issues with sports bodies. You only need common sense. If given the chance to be the Sports Minister, I can put all federations in order within six months with no political interference.    But as the Olympic Charter states, it’s not always about winning; it’s more important to take part in sports with good values and spirits. That’s what my committee and I have done for rugby, against all odds.       How do you intend to overcome financial challenges in the future?      I don’t see any financial drama if the political interference is stopped and all those who caused financial instability during their tenure are held accountable. Additionally, they should be barred from holding office in any sports body. The strength of my elected council during the last two years and the current year is of securing sponsorships, which we have done and will continue to do.    The corporate sector has a lot of trust in rugby, and there are sponsorships available. We have secured Nippon Paint for the next three years with the inter-club league and knockout tournaments. Nippon Paint has an open mind for SLR to attract co-sponsorship, which has been the success of SLR putting together many local and international tournaments recently.       Do you have anything else to add?   What the country needs is a general election so that the people can select new leaders. Consider what is going on currently in sports laws, along with new laws that are implemented just for political reasons.    Advisors who have been appointed have no clue as to what’s going on; it’s like a copy-and-paste job. No federation has been involved in the drafting of these new laws and Acts being passed; it’s just a handful of people who are the ministers’ favourites who are now trying to change and run policies. It’s shameful.    There are people who are manipulators defining themselves as Sri Lanka Rugby on Facebook and other social media platforms. They are people suffering from personality disorders such as borderline personality and narcissistic personality, manipulating others to get what they want.   The “Sri Lanka Rugby” status only belongs to the union, and manipulators who are suffering from such disorders will continue to do what they are doing. As SLR, we will take appropriate legal action in taking down these social media pages soon.

Speaking to The Daily Morning on the matter, Yapa said that several Government, Opposition, and “independent” MPs are currently in discussions regarding the formation of a broad political alliance that suits the current trends. “Everyone will agree that the existing political culture in our country will not last much longer. That is because it has resulted in nothing but setbacks in almost every sector. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a political force that suits current trends, and we are discussing the formation of such.”   When queried as to whether any decisions have been made regarding the leadership of the proposed alliance, he said that such decisions would be made in the future. “We, as a group, are discussing this matter. That does not mean that we are going behind someone or trying to work against someone. These discussions are merely based on the country’s timely needs. There is no leadership as of now, but those decisions will be made in the future.”  Since the Sri Lanka Freedom Party’s (SLFP) National Organiser and Opposition MP Duminda Dissanayake was also reported to have attended the relevant discussions, The Daily Morning contacted him, and he said that the SLFP, as a political party, is currently holding discussions with various parties.   There were recent media reports to the effect that several Opposition MPs as well as those who are unhappy with the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna’s programme have had a few discussions with Lanza, and that the latter is to form a new political alliance. It was also reported that they had informed President and United National Party Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe of their preparations.

Speaking to the media yesterday, he claimed that qualified graduates as well as diploma holders enrolled under a probation period are at risk of losing their jobs due to this thoughtless decision taken by the Ministry. “According to a request made by the Ministry, since 2006, the Ministry of Higher Education has been adequately training allied health sciences’ graduates for the health service. But, the Health Ministry has failed to recruit them into the service and has repeatedly recruited diploma holders spending millions of rupees unnecessarily. Due to this arbitrary decision taken by a former Health Secretary, in addition to wasting a lot of money, qualified graduates as well as diploma holders who were recruited for training are to lose their jobs. Meanwhile, almost a 1,000 allied health sciences’ graduates are unemployed,” he claimed. He also alleged that the former Health Secretary in question took this decision on the request of a specialist working at the Medical Research Institute (MRI) and an Additional Secretary to the Ministry. “The former Secretary in question took this decision under the influence of an Additional Secretary at the Ministry and a specialist working at the MRI who benefitted by implementing this programme. Consequently, the Government has to bear a huge loss. We urged the Government that damages should be recovered from this former Secretary and the Additional Secretary who endorsed that decision,” he further claimed. He also claimed that even though the President continues to declare that he will not cut the necessary allocations for the recruitments to the health service, without properly obtaining the necessary approvals for the recruitments and without reserving the allocations, the relevant Additional Secretary rendered these graduates unemployed for three years, thus bringing the Government into disrepute.

Speaking to the media yesterday (13), Ranawaka stated that rumours are afloat about funds not being given to the Election Commission (EC) for the LG Election. “As officials who are aware of the law, Siriwardana should remember the verdict given by the Supreme Court to former President and incumbent Opposition MP Maithripala Sirisena, the former Secretary to the Ministry of Defence Hemasiri Fernando, the former Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara, and former Intelligence officers in the Easter Sunday attacks’ case. Through this judgement, it is evident that especially ministry secretaries, adhere to the duties that have been constitutionally given to them. Therefore, Siriwardana is duty-bound to fulfil the peoples’ right to vote that is laid down in the Constitution. As a law abiding officer, we expect him to undertake this duty.”   In a landmark verdict last month (January), the Supreme Court which held Sirisena, former Defence Ministry Secretary Hemasiri Fernando, former Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara, former State Intelligence Service Director and incumbent Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police – Administration Nilantha Jayawardena, and former Chief of National Intelligence and DIG Sisira Mendis have violated fundamental human rights by not preventing the Easter Sunday terror attacks of 2019, also ordered them to personally pay Rs. 310 million as compensation to the victims of the bombings with Sirisena being ordered to pay the highest sum of compensation of Rs. 100 million.   Speaking further, Ranawaka stated that a day’s revenue of the Government was sufficient to hold the entire election. “It must be clearly stated that ‘we have no money’ is not a response when taking into account the events that the Government has held recently. When considering the Government’s revenue, only one day of the Government's revenue is needed for this Election. Therefore, there is no obstacle to hold this election. The election is not something that happens only on 9 March. There are a number of duties that have to be undertaken by the EC before 9 March. They have to hold the postal votes, voting cards have to be printed and distributed to houses, and polling stations have to be prepared. So, the election cannot be done all of a sudden,” he added.   Speaking to   The Daily Morning   on 9 February, EC Chairman, Attorney Nimal G. Punchihewa stated that the EC was yet to receive any response from the Ministry of Finance in regard to their request for Rs. 770 million as the LG election expenditure for the month of February. He further told   The Daily Morning   that although a letter was sent to the Ministry, there had been no response.   Meanwhile, polls monitors and related organisations made a written request to the Ministry of Finance on 12 February for the release of funds required for the LG election, noting that it is the responsibility of all Government officials to support the EC in holding the LG election.   However, a print media news report, quoting Punchihewa, stated that the EC had received Rs. 100 million out of the Rs. 770 million that had been requested for February, and that they were hopeful that the Government would release the balance Rs. 670 million within the next two weeks.

Ven. Wekandawala Rahula Thera, a Buddhist monk and prominent environmental activist, was one of the first to raise the alarm about the project.   Speaking to   The Sunday Morning  , the Thera said that he and other community leaders had been informed by the wildlife authorities that a private company had been granted permission to construct a wind power plant in the buffer zone of the Kalametiya Bird Sanctuary.   The Thera explained that the project would involve the destruction of 150 acres of forest land belonging to the buffer zone, which surrounded the sanctuary. He also criticised the Government for failing to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) before granting permission for the project to go ahead.   “The village leaders and the community in the region and I went and spoke to the wildlife authority and we were told that 150 acres of the buffer zone had been demarcated for a private company to set up a wind power plant,” the Thera said. “We were also told that the measuring and estimations had already been carried out.”   “We then made a Right to Information request to find out whether the Kalametiya Bird Sanctuary was being used for a wind power plant development project. However, the Survey Department and the Wildlife Department responded that no such activity was going on. While it is true that there is no project being undertaken inside the sanctuary itself, it is very clear that a part of the buffer zone of the sanctuary has been allowed to be harmed as a result of setting up this energy development project by a private company.”       Proper procedures not followed       The Kalametiya Bird Sanctuary is an important ecological and historical site in Sri Lanka. It is home to a diverse range of bird species, many of which migrate to and reside in the area. The sanctuary also contains important archaeological sites and is recognised as a wildlife sanctuary with an important network of lagoons, mangroves, and waterways.   Environmental Conservation Trust (ECT) Director Sajeewa Chamikara, whose organisation is a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) that works to protect the environment in Sri Lanka, expressed concern that the wind power plant would cause irreparable harm to the sanctuary and its inhabitants.    Chamikara pointed out that the project had not undergone an Environmental Impact Assessment and that the proper approvals had not been obtained from the relevant authorities.      “There has been no EIA done. How was the survey carried out without the EIA being done? As per the normal process, once a proposal for such a project is put forward, an EIA is done before approval is given. Clearly the proper process has not been followed,” Chamikara alleged.   “The Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance has declared Kalametiya as a sanctuary. Accordingly, any development project undertaken within 100 metres of the border area must be undertaken according to the National Environmental Act. However, this process has not been done. This land comes under Section 20 of the Forest Conservation Ordinance while also being State forest land. This land is under the Forest Department, so how did they do the estimations and surveys?” he questioned.       Negative impacts       Chamikara also raised concerns about the potential impact of the wind turbines on the environment. He noted that wind turbines were massive structures that required a lot of land and that the vibrations they produce could harm the environment if not properly managed.   “Windmills are massive structures. This means a lot of land is going to be taken and a lot of wildlife is going to be destroyed or damaged. There is also the issue of the powerful vibrations that are emitted by the windmills that can harm the environment. There are methods to reduce this, but how can we trust that these things will be done if the proper approval to begin the process has not even been followed?”       State authorities deny allegations       Nevertheless, State authorities were quick to dismiss the allegations.    Sustainable Energy Authority Director General Athula Jayathunga pointed out that an EIA must be carried out in addition to receiving approval from other authorities before such a project could commence.   “When carrying out such development projects, an Environmental Impact Assessment is always carried out to ensure that there is no harm to the environment. If such a project is proposed, then there is no need to worry about it harming the environment because such an assessment must be done for the project to be approved. In addition, other approvals from the district secretariat and the Archaeological Department will also have to be sought. If such approval isn’t given or the EIA is unsuccessful, then the project cannot go ahead,” he explained.   However, Central Environmental Authority (CEA) Deputy Director General Sanjaya Rathnayake said that he would look into the matter to determine if an unapproved power plant was being set up in the buffer zone of the Kalametiya Sanctuary.    “As far as we know, there are no projects near the Kalametiya Sanctuary. There are some 10 MW wind power plants in the region, but those are adjacent to the highway. There are 10 more to be processed and approved also near the highway. I will immediately send a team to ascertain if there is any damage being done to the buffer zone,” he said.

He has accordingly notified the Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka (CAASL) that there are trained pilots with experience who could fill the vacancies.    Speaking to   The Sunday Morning Business,   he noted: “It may be necessary to consider recruiting pilots from outside Sri Lanka to address the impending shortage, as leaving aircraft grounded on the tarmac without pilots is not a viable option.”   According to reports, 42 pilots of SriLankan Airlines submitted their resignation letters last week, while 85 pilots have requested certification letters from the CAASL.    The crisis has been attributed to the relatively low pilot wages, currently set at $ 10,000 per month. With the airline employing approximately 240 pilots, the resignation of a significant number will have an adverse impact on the country’s tourism sector.   SriLankan Airlines CEO Richard Nuttall acknowledged the airline’s struggle to retain talent, with technical staff and pilots being lured away by other carriers. To address this issue, the airline is planning to initiate cadet programmes and recruit expatriate pilots.   However, Minister of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva denied the existence of a pilot resignation crisis, attributing the decrease in the number of pilots to the reduced fleet size rather than a shortage.    “When the airline had 26 aircraft, it employed 312 pilots, whereas with the current fleet of 16 aircraft there are 266 pilots,” he said.   He also pointed out that around 150 pilots had already applied to join SriLankan Airlines, suggesting a potential inflow of new pilots.   Regardless, it is essential to recognise that SriLankan Airlines is undergoing restructuring as a State-Owned Enterprise. The first step in this process, aimed at privatising numerous State-owned businesses including the airline, involves restructuring the company’s balance sheets.    To facilitate this, the Government has established a State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit (SOERU) under the Ministry of Finance, which collaborates with international contractors.   At a later stage, SriLankan Airlines will invite Expressions of Interest (EoIs) for its acquisition. Prospective buyers, including India’s Tata Group (owners of Air India), have shown interest in the matter. However, proceedings will need to await the restructuring of the company’s balance sheet.    There persists a strong reluctance to take risks with tourism, given the significant investments made in promotional programmes across various countries. The President aims to attract high-end tourists and exceed $ 15 billion in tourist earnings. Notably, the country is currently experiencing a surge in tourist arrivals.   According to SLTDA statistics, from January to May 2022, Sri Lanka received 378,521 tourists, while during the same period in 2023, the number increased to 524,486 tourists.    Air travel remains the primary mode of transportation for tourists compared to sea travel. Finding solutions to the pilot shortage is crucial for SriLankan Airlines in order to ensure that all aircraft are operational and meet the increasing demand for air seat capacity in the country.

Recent incidents of a local drug supplier named Isolez Biotech Pharma AG (Pvt.) Ltd. importing a batch of human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and another batch of Rituximab injection, which is administered to cancer patients, led to great controversy in the recent past.   Against this backdrop, Secretary to the Ministry Janaka Sri Chandraguptha told   The Daily Morning   that they had formulated a mechanism to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future. “We have informed the relevant institutions regarding how to act in relation to these matters. In addition, we have prepared a system to verify the authenticity of documents submitted by companies that import drugs.”   Earlier this month (October), the National Medicines Regulatory Authority stated that a batch of IVIG imported to Sri Lanka from India had been suspended from use. This was following the revelation that the relevant local supplier, Isolez Biotech Pharma AG (Pvt.) Ltd., had imported it by submitting forged documents for Customs clearance.   Meanwhile, when queried as to whether the ministry would prepare any new programme to regulate companies that import drugs into the country in light of the recent incidents, Chandraguptha said last week that a new circular in that regard would be issued in the coming days.

According to a notice issued by IRD last week, changes proposed to the Inland Revenue Act, No. 24 of 2017 by the Inland Revenue Bill with Committee Stage Amendments approved by Parliament on 9 December, the Government has decided to limit the 14% concessionary rate given to the 14 listed companies to the first half of the 2022/23 financial year.   The concession, which was announced under Budget 2021, sought to provide a 50% tax concession on companies listed on the CSE between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2021, and further maintain a 14% concessionary corporate taxation rate for three more years.   Fourteen companies were entitled to the concession, and according to their respective financial statements, they were able to enjoy a tax break of about Rs. 600 million due to the 50% concession for the financial year 2021/22.   Further, with the new amendments to the Inland Revenue Act first being gazetted in October 2022, a Fundamental Rights petition was filed at the Supreme Court challenging the Bill by Prime Land Residencies PLC and Myland Developments PLC, which were among the 14 listed companies entitled to the concession, sharing the legal cost with JAT Holdings PLC and Windforce PLC, another two companies that listed on the CSE in 2021.   The petition, which was seen by   The Morning Business,   stated that, placing reliance on the policy of the Government as declared and being induced thereby, the petitioners had issued a prospectus inviting members of the public to subscribe to their shares, and listed their shares at the CSE.   The petitioners had stated in such prospectus that gains and profits of the company (other than gains from the realisation of investment assets) would be taxed at the rate of 14% for the three years of assessment commencing from 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2025.   “They have spent a substantial sum as expenses related to the listing in the Colombo Stock Exchange with a legitimate expectation of the guaranteed 14% tax rates for three years of assessment (36 months) commencing from 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2025, whereas other companies have not done such listing with the said legitimate expectation,” the petition said.   According to the latest amendments, the 14 companies will also be subjected to 30% corporate income tax from the second half of the 2022/23 financial year.   Due to the concession, in 2021, the CSE witnessed a record Rs. 124 billion in capital-raising, where the capital raised was a combination of Rs. 84.4 billion via debt and Rs. 39.4 billion in equity, as the CSE saw 28 new listings, including 14 debt IPOs and 13 equity IPOs.

State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe stressed that the Samurdhi welfare scheme had been manipulated by some to benefit those who did not fit the criteria.    “We cannot go back to the Samurdhi scheme. If you go to any common man in the villages or among the urban poor, it is a common complaint that social welfare benefits such as the Samurdhi scheme were being received by those who did not deserve it – those with higher incomes,” Semasinghe told  The Sunday Morning  .    “We are trying to rectify this concern of human error after two-and-a-half decades. Most of the people who will be selected will be from below the poverty line. If there is anyone selected who is above the poverty line or does not meet the eligibility criteria, that person will be removed by the Divisional Secretariat,” he added.    Semasinghe went on to say that the new social welfare scheme – Aswesuma – would ensure that those who were truly in need would receive the financial benefits. This, despite criticism that some who had benefited under the Samurdhi programme had been left out by the new programme – an allegation the Government denies.      “No beneficiary has been selected yet under the new scheme. There is an indicative name list which has been published and time given for objections as well as appeals. It is only once that time period is completed that we can publish the final list of new beneficiaries who have been selected. Anybody who wishes to be included under the scheme shouldn’t go behind any union or politician; instead, they should file an appeal or an objection with the Divisional Secretariat,” Semasinghe asserted.    Sri Lanka initiated a new social safety net programme following the economic crisis with assistance from several multinational agencies by conducting a poverty survey to find eligible persons to receive benefits.      Last week, several Members of Parliament raised concerns about alleged shortcomings in the new Aswesuma scheme, calling for the Samurdhi programme to be continued.

During a media briefing yesterday (28), the media queried Alles regarding the Catholic Church's response to the Government following the receipt of the complete report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (CoI) that investigated the terror attacks, and the progress of the related investigations.   In response, he said that he was of the view that 99% of the related investigations carried out by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) were over. ""The Catholic Church and certain other individuals keep holding media briefings and claiming that investigations have not been conducted properly. They were lamenting that they had not been given the CoI's report, and then I took steps to hand it over to the Church on approval of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Both before and after that, I urged the Church to grant us an opportunity to meet them to explain the current status of the investigations,"" Alles stated.   If such an opportunity were to be granted, the Minister said that someone from the Church, including its bishops, would have been able to point out if there had been any deficiency in the related investigations.

The final report of the CoI was tabled in Parliament on 8 April 2021, but the witness records were not released, reportedly due to legal reasons. In February 2022, all the volumes of the report, including related witness records, were handed over to the Speaker of Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana.

Thai Natural Resources and Environment Minister  Varawut Silpa-archa  made the announcement, indicating that the elephant's return to Sri Lanka is highly unlikely.     Multiple Sri Lankan Buddhist organizations have called on the Thai government to consider sending the elephant back, but with the King assuming ownership, such a scenario appears unlikely.      The tusker ‘Muthu Raja’ known as ‘ Sak Surin ’ in Thai, was flown back to Bangkok Thailand from  Katunayake Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA)  in a specially arranged heavy lift cargo plane.     Initially presented to former President Chandrika Kumaranatunga (CBK) as a gesture of goodwill from the Thai royal family, Muthu-Raja had been under the care of the Kande Viharaya Buddhist temple in Aluthgama.      Concerns were raised by animal rights organizations about the severe abuse suffered by the tusker under its mahout.     Efforts were made to transfer Muthu-Raja to  Dehiwala Zoo  at the request of the Thai ambassador, but due to inadequate facilities, the decision was made to return the elephant to Thailand.     Minister Varawut shared that the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) has reported that most Thai elephants sent abroad as ""goodwill ambassadors"" are thriving and well-cared for in their host countries.     Muthu Raja, currently undergoing quarantine at an elephant conservation centre in Lampang province, faces various health challenges, including a cataract in the right eye, an inflexible front left leg, infected wounds on the hips, and issues with nails and foot soles.     Following the 30-day quarantine period, Muthu Raja will undergo a comprehensive examination and receive necessary treatment until full recovery.      Despite the ailments, the tusker remains in good spirits due to the favourable environment and ample resting time, though complete recovery may take time.

Last year,  The Sunday Morning   reported that the CPC had earlier planned to upgrade the low-quality petrol stock to octane 92 level and sell it to the market – a plan which was shelved at the time due to the refinery being shut down due to the lack of crude oil imports.    However, according to CPC Chairman Mohamed Uvais Mohamed, the corporation has begun to blend the low octane fuel to the octane 92 petrol standard and is likely to convert all 6,000 MT since the refinery is now in full operation.    “We are using a small quantity of the stock each day and will blend it to the octane 92 standards. With the refinery now fully operational, it shouldn’t take long to blend the entire stock,” Mohamed said.    Octane 80 petrol is produced as part of the refining startup process and collected during the first few operational days, a senior official at the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery said.     The upgrade to octane 92 petrol, which is used by most gasoline motor vehicles in Sri Lanka, requires octane 80 to be blended with a higher octane product, such as octane 93. Octane 93 petrol is also produced by the refinery when fully operational, a senior refinery official told  The Sunday Morning  .      According to Mohamed, the multiple shutdowns the refinery faced in the last two years were due to crude oil supply constraints and the forex shortage.

Speaking to   TV     Derana   on Tuesday (19), he said that Sri Lanka is looking to obtain 500 MW, which would be 6% of the energy mix by 2030 when the grid becomes operational.   He said that it is a win-win project for both countries as India has low-cost renewable energy. “Through an interconnection we can buy power from India, and when we have excess (power) we can sell it to India as well,” he added.    India currently has the fourth largest renewable energy installed capacity in the world, which stood at 122 GW as of February 2023 and accounts for 12.3% of the country’s total energy requirement.   Seneviratne said that the proposed grid connectivity is a prudent decision with limitations coming from technical aspects as well as national security.   “So our forecast is we may use a maximum of 6% of the country’s requirement from this particular link. In case this is broken down, we can manage with our existing resources because it is limited,” he said.   According to the Long Term Generation Plan 2023-2042 put out by the Ministry of Power and Energy earlier this year, Sri Lanka is expected to reach a demand of 25,253 GWh by 2030 with a generation capacity of 8,330 MW, from a total installed capacity of about 4,900 MW as of the end of 2022.   Sri Lanka power authorities are also aiming at achieving 70% renewable energy generation by 2030 – from the current 58% – and becoming carbon neutral by 2050, while developing an additional capacity of 3,867 MW (out of the 8,330 MW) of renewable energy by 2030 from energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and biomass.   Taking to his official X account, Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera greenlit the project on 6 June saying: “ Regional energy integration has been discussed for more than two decades and the Government has made it a priority to implement the India-Sri Lanka grid connection by 2030.

Shortages of animal feed and medicines and prevailing inflation have hampered egg and poultry production, pushing prices beyond the reach of many.    All-Island Poultry Farmers’ Association Chairman Ajith Gunasekara told  The Sunday Morning   that since the Yala season’s rice production had increased and farmers were complaining of a lack of buyers for their rice, the association had informed the Agriculture Minister and the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) that it was willing to buy raw rice from farmers directly to produce the animal feed required.    “The response seems favourable. We are also producing an essential form of nutrition and this way we can support the local rice farmers too,” he said.     Attempts to contact Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera regarding this matter were futile.     Earlier this year, the Government banned the use of rice for animal feed due to the food crisis, prioritising rice for human consumption.    The Court of Appeal last week issued a directive to the CAA to revise and implement a new Maximum Retail Price (MRP) for eggs.    This, as experts warned of increasing malnutrition, especially among children. With eggs being the cheapest source of animal protein available in the market, an increase in egg prices may adversely affect consumers.    Speaking to  The Sunday Morning,   Gunasekara stated that the shortage of animal feed in Sri Lanka remained unchanged.     He explained that as cereals had high demand globally, Sri Lanka would experience a shortage as it could not secure Letters of Credit (LCs) from banks on time to import feed.    The poultry industry had been struggling with the forex shortage and the inability to import animal feed and related products to sustain its operations.    “Malnutrition is a social issue and we are trying to increase production to decrease prices in the market, but it is challenging. We are promoting home farming for eggs, especially in rural areas. People will soon have to produce their own protein.”    Gunasekara also spoke of the medicine and vaccine shortages and added that with dollar payments being approved, the situation would get better soon. “This is a local industry which we need to protect since we have no dollars to import meat and eggs now. We must support our egg and chicken producers,” he said.    Responding to a question regarding the pricing of eggs, National Livestock Development Board (NLDB) Assistant General Manager Namal Amunugama told  The Sunday Morning   that it was unwise to increase prices now as current prices were the highest-ever recorded thus far and consumers would not be able purchase eggs, especially considering the festive season.    He added that it was pointless to fix the prices of eggs and meat without considering the price fluctuations of raw materials such as animal feed.    Amunugama stated that with cattle and poultry feed prices increasing throughout the last six months, neither the farmers nor the consumers could bear the prices. He added that due to the fertiliser issue, local maize production during the last Maha season had seen a drastic reduction, while sourcing imports to bridge the deficit was also not easy due to the dollar shortage.     He further elaborated that in the animal husbandry industry there was no alternative but to import the necessary raw materials such as maize.    The average market price for a 50 kg sack of broiler feed is currently priced between Rs. 19,000-20,000, which is unbearable for local livestock and poultry producers and in turn reflects on the final market prices of broiler chicken, eggs, and milk.    Amunugama stated that certain medicines required in the poultry industry had also increased in price while certain necessary vaccines were short in supply. “The situation in the market will take at least two years to settle,” he said.    According to him, the annual per capita consumption of eggs is 120 and chicken is 10 kg.    “Eggs are the cheapest source of animal protein available and with these price increases, malnutrition will also increase. We will see the effects of this soon. Authorities need to take immediate action to rectify the matter,” he said.

As was revealed recently, the authorities are planning to introduce a demerit system for driving licenses, which has been under discussion for years in Sri Lanka, with effect from early next year. Under this system, points will be deducted with regard to over 30 traffic law violations, and driving licenses of those with more than 24 points will be cancelled for a period of one year.    In this regard, State Minister of Transport Lasantha Alagiyawanna had stated that traffic law violators tend tk merely pay the relevant fine when penalised for an offence and continue to repeatedly commit similar offences without understanding the gravity of their actions and the implications on the safety of others. He emphasised the importance of minimising deaths caused by road accidents.      Support and opposition from drivers      To look into what drivers think of this proposed demerit system, which is rather new to Sri Lanka,   The Morning   spoke to several drivers in Colombo, most of whom expressed support to this system, adding that it will help keep many irresponsible drivers off the streets. In addition, they noted that more stringent, innovative methods are necessary to reduce road accidents, and that Sri Lanka should learn from other countries that have employed such methods.   “Such a system should have been introduced a long time ago. Had we done that, we could have saved a lot of lives which we lost because of irresponsible drivers that were not taught a lesson the first instance that they acted in an irresponsible manner,” said 31-year-old driver Saman Oshantha.   However, he did not see this system as the best way of creating responsible drivers, explaining: “Having such a system in place would significantly increase disciplined drivers on the roads. However, I do not think that this is the best way to create disciplined drivers. This is a system that disciplines drivers who have committed a certain offense, in order to prevent them from committing a bigger one. So a road accident or a traffic violation would have already happened by the time this system is implemented against a driver. I think that we need a stronger system that disciplines drivers before they are permitted to drive a vehicle on public roads.”   Also expressing support for the proposed demerit system, 45-year-old driver K.U. Samaradiwakara said that this system will significantly reduce road accidents and that deterrents are always a better option than punishment.   “Thus far, we resorted to punishments, mostly fines, thinking that it would discourage drivers from driving recklessly. However, it is these types of methods (a reference to the proposed demerit system) that could actually help us make roads safe. Preventing is always better than finding solutions, and what this method does is discourage drivers from being irresponsible. Taking action through the demerit system is a better warning than a fine, because drivers know that the former affects their future as a driver, unlike a fine.”   Moreover, Samaradiwakara added that since this is a completely new system, it is crucial that the authorities raise awareness about it, especially regarding the sort of impact this could have on drivers.   However, some who spoke with   The Morning   expressed doubts about the proper implementation of this system, especially if it is handled exclusively by the Police, with the main reason behind this sentiment being the tendency towards corruption on the part of the Police.    “If it is the Police, especially Traffic Police officers, that are going to implement this system, I do not think that this system would bring about the change that we expect,” said 36-year-old driver Kamala Anuradha. Expressing displeasure about the manner in which the Police, especially Traffic Police officers, enforce traffic laws, she said that in many cases, drivers get away with traffic law violations through bribing Police officers or through political influence. She said that this could similarly happen in the case of the proposed demerit system, further opining that it will in turn result in those who have money or the ability to exert influence on Police officers getting away with traffic law violations while only those lacking such options will be punished.    Several other persons shared the same opinion, adding that a new system is necessary to ensure the proper implementation of the proposed demerit system.     Twenty-six-year-old driver Merusa Indranath explained: “Traffic Police officers are one of the most venal officials in Sri Lanka, and drivers too have grown accustomed to bribing them to avoid fines or court cases. If the Government is going to introduce a demerit system, it is absolutely necessary to introduce a concurrent programme to prevent Traffic Police officers from accepting or demanding bribes when implementing the demerit system. Otherwise, like many other existing laws, regulations, and systems, this too will be useless in discouraging careless drivers, or worse, increase bribery of Traffic Police officers by drivers.”   He further claimed that in a context where cases of Traffic Police officers falsely accusing drivers of traffic law violations and fining for the same have been reported, if the proposed demerit system is also misused in the same manner, it will have worse impacts on drivers than a mere fine, since the traffic law violations recorded through the demerit system could affect drivers in the future. In addition, he said that if actions are taken against a driver through the demerit system due to a mistake made by Traffic Police officers when determining whether the driver violated traffic laws, such a mistake could have far-reaching impacts on the driver.      Benefitting from the demerit system       According to University of Moratuwa Transport and Logistics Department Senior Professor Amal S. Kumarage, in order to reap the full benefits of the proposed demerit system, proper collection, sharing and the analysis of data is necessary, and that Sri Lanka should look into such when implementing this system. Speaking to   The Morning  , he explained: “For this system to be effective and to get the maximum results out of it, it should be linked to vehicle insurance. In addition to the actions taken by the Police, insurance companies should also take actions against drivers because these measures are taken in order to minimise vehicle accidents.    “In order to achieve that and to manage the millions of vehicles that we have, it is important to have a proper data system which contains the demerit system’s data. Data systems on vehicles, drivers and also road accidents should be in place, and all three systems should be linked. Currently, there is one system at the Department of Motor Traffic, another one at the Police, and another one with the insurance companies. A connection between these systems is necessary, and it should be possible to see the driving history of any driver, which are not complex actions with today’s technology.”   Prof. Kumarage added that collecting data is not adequate, and that that data should be analysed to determine what sort of new steps can be taken to improve the existing situation.    “What we are trying to do today was a standard practice in the world more than 20 years ago,” he said, expressing concerns about Sri Lanka taking more time than it should have in order to introduce a demerit system.    “This system was proposed more than 20 years ago, and it is good that we are finally able to introduce it, even though it has taken a long time. This shows how difficult it is for us to introduce modern vehicular management systems to the people’s lives, in a context where the world is moving forward. I think that the weaknesses in the governing system are responsible for this delay. Demerit systems are in place in many countries. In other countries, driving licenses being cancelled is also a part of this system.”   In addition, Prof. Kumarage explained the objectives of a demerit system, adding that the prevention of road accidents is better than punishing drivers: “We have a notion that it is only punishments that can be used to discipline people, which is an outdated notion. In modern societies, it is accepted that it is better to point out people’s mistakes in advance and rectify those mistakes before they can cause massive damage.    “A demerit system should not be used to punish people, but to teach them what is wrong and right, or to give them a form of advice. In other countries, demerit systems allow not only cancelling licenses, but also educating drivers when a mistake has been made. Therefore, this should be used to improve a person’s driving skills.”   At present, similar systems that use a points system to take action against drivers that violate traffic laws are in effect in many countries including Australia, Denmark, Bulgaria, Spain, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Canada, France, New Zealand, and Singapore.

According to NARA Director General Dr. Kamal Tennakoon, a team from the agency, including divers, will carry out the underwater survey off the Uppuveli and Nilaveli coast near Trincomalee.    Dr. Tennakoon told   The Sunday Morning   that the samples collected by them would be tested and a report submitted to the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) and the Fisheries Ministry.   Both NARA and MEPA deployed teams last week to collect samples of the tar-like substance which had washed ashore, with reports expected by the end of the month.   The first report of the tar-like substance washing ashore was made on Wednesday (12). After the samples were collected, officials cleaned the beach of the substance with the aid of villages and fishermen.   When contacted, MEPA Chairperson Asela Rekawa told   The Sunday Morning   that the agency originally suspected that the tar-like substance was sludge (the residue from any oil separation process or oily bilge water) discharged from a South Korean-flagged LNG tanker which was close by, but had decided to release the vessel to continue on its journey after a team from MEPA boarded the vessel and took copies of its logs and records.   According to Rekawa, the team had not witnessed any leakage or evidence of a recent discharge from the suspect vessel.    However, he said that the vessel was being monitored and if another similar incident was reported and evidence was collected to the effect, legal action against the vessel could be launched.     Commenting on the incident, the MEPA Chair opined that Sri Lanka needed a more aggressive monitoring and prevention mechanism.    According to him, MEPA has sought Cabinet approval to establish a satellite imaging monitoring system which could be used to check for such spills and mount surveillance for deliberate and accidental oil spills around the coast of Sri Lanka.   “The satellite imagery system is a very useful tool for our duties and we are getting it as a grant from the French Government. We have already sought Cabinet approval for the system,” Rekawa said.

The official explained that in order to achieve 70% of the total electricity requirement through RE, the existing grid must be expanded, and added that the cost of this expansion was estimated at present to be approximately $ 9 billion.     He claimed that the expansion cost, once factored into the tariff calculation, was likely to gradually increase end-user tariffs by the end of 2030, even if the Government secured support from international funding agencies for the expansion.    “We’re not saying that adding RE is not viable. What we stress is the importance of conducting thorough research on end-user tariffs by the end of 2030. That is why we need scientists to go the extra mile. Otherwise, it could lead to disaster,” the official claimed.    The official continued: “If we had made the right decisions in 2010, we wouldn’t be facing these challenges now. Similarly, we are making decisions for a period 10 years ahead without conducting proper research in the sector. Up until 2026, the CEB has prepared a plan to integrate RE into the existing grid through several transmission line expansions. The issue arises after 2026, as no more new additions can be made to the existing grid.”       LTGEP policy shift       In April 2019, the Government initially proposed a renewable energy target of 50% by 2030, a goal that was subsequently increased to 70% in the 2022 policy update. The CEB has faced strong criticism about not working quickly to absorb renewable energy, from State officials including the former energy minister as well as from the domestic RE industry.    The Long Term Generation Expansion Plan (LTGEP) 2023-2042 reveals the profound impact of this policy shift. It states that this change has effectively removed the flexibility for optimising renewable energy sources during generation planning. Instead, RE is now mandated by policy, with limited room for optimisation due to policy directives that also exclude coal as a fuel source.    The plan aims to increase total RE capacity from 2,711 MW in early 2022 to 8,783 MW by the end of 2030, and 16,963 MW by the end of 2042. It also emphasises refurbishing or replacing ageing RE plants with similar technology after their plant life or Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) expires.    The LTGEP presents several cost scenarios to achieve and maintain 70% RE by 2030, avoid coal-fired plant additions, and consider different factors.    To achieve 70% RE by 2030, maintain it beyond 2030, and avoid coal-fired plant additions throughout, the total present value cost is $ 18,872 million. When cross-border interconnection with India is considered, the cost rises slightly to $ 18,883 million, exceeding the base case of the LTGEP 2023-2042 by a marginal difference of $ 11 million.    Furthermore, if nuclear power development beyond 2040 is incorporated into the plan, the total present value cost reaches $ 18,986 million.    In contrast, adhering to the previous policy guidelines, aiming for 50% RE by 2030 and maintaining it beyond 2030 while eschewing coal-fired plant additions results in a total present value cost of $ 17,792 million.    This scenario reflects a lower cost compared to the base case and identifies an incremental cost of approximately $ 1 billion for increasing the RE target from 50% to 70% by 2030 as per the latest policy guidelines. These scenarios underscore the intricate trade-offs and complexities associated with achieving higher RE targets while navigating policy directives and cost considerations.       2030 tariffs unpredictable       In such a backdrop, Solar Industries Association (SIA) President Kushan Jayasuriya said that it was difficult to predict the tariffs for 2030, since the Government was now following a cost-reflective tariff mechanism.    Speaking to   The Sunday Morning  , he said: “The Government is moving towards the cost-reflective tariff model. Whenever fuel prices go up, it will go up, and when prices come down, it will come down. If we implement some renewable energy technology by 2030 which does not entail major dollar taxes, it is likely that it won’t cause any major tariff hike. In terms of consumer usage, normally in Sri Lanka it is very close to the economic growth of the country, although there were exceptional cases during Covid.”     He added that since the Government was planning to go ahead with an aggressive renewable energy mechanism by absorbing more RE, should we succeed in implementing a number of mega-scale renewable energy projects, then the risk of the electricity cost going up would be minimal.    “For RE plants, it is only the capital cost that applies. Chances of the cost going up are zero. For fuel, however, when the prices go up, the costs also go up,” Jayasuriya said.    He added: “We have always subsidised electricity and used it as a commodity for which consumers never pay the right price. As a result, we fall into debt, as we have not paid the right cost and compensated for it elsewhere, which turns it into a long-term debt.”    He also stressed that the lack of a cost-reflective tariff meant that efficiency was not prioritised.    “We took energy for granted. Only once we faced an economic collapse did we realise that we were selling at a loss. The Minister is aggressively trying to bridge the gap, but by the time we act, it will be too late,” he said.    Highlighting grid expansion costs, Jayasuriya suggested that similar to developed countries, things would have to be managed by pooling money from power plant owners and that plant owners would have to become more competitive, since the central management would otherwise buy from the cheapest plant.    “For decades, we didn’t put the burden on the public. But when we became bankrupt, the accumulated burden of many years fell upon the public,” he said.    Meanwhile, when contacted by   The Sunday Morning,   CEB Chairman Nalinda Illangakoon acknowledged that they did not possess a comprehensive end-user tariff for the end of 2030.    However, the Chairman noted that the CEB was working towards achieving the targets set by the Government, stressing the need for comprehensive research regarding end-user tariffs while achieving set targets.

The letter was received by the Finance Ministry last week, a few days after India had sent a letter to the IMF expressing the country’s support for Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring programme.   A senior Government source told   The Sunday Morning   that the Sri Lankan Government was expecting the Chinese Government to respond in a positive manner to the debt restructuring programme, like India. Instead, it is reliably learnt that the Chinese have sent a letter to Sri Lanka’s Finance Ministry saying that it would support the IMF programme.   The senior Government source noted that the Government was hopeful of a positive letter from the Chinese, similar to the one sent by the Indians, and was “rather disappointed” with the letter received from the Chinese side.   “However, we will continue with the negotiations (debt restructuring) and hope for the best,” the source said, reiterating that the response received from China fell short of what was expected.   India’s willingness to cooperate with the Paris Club on the issue of Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring is not being shared by the Chinese, it is also learnt.   The Paris Club has proposed that debt restructuring be uniform for all creditors, with suggestions that private creditors be offered a haircut while bilateral creditors are offered loan deferrals.   The IMF, meanwhile, has reportedly been in talks with China to try and convince the country to restructure Sri Lanka’s debt.   During a roundtable media interaction, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has stated that the IMF wants to help China understand both the whole issue of debt sustainability and what can be a pathway for its contribution.   The Indian Government last week took yet another step in its support towards neighbouring Sri Lanka finding reprieve to its economic woes by sending an official letter to the IMF expressing India’s support to Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring programme.   The letter sent by Indian Ministry of Finance Department of Economic Affairs Additional Secretary Rajat Kumar Mishra on Monday (16) to the IMF Managing Director states: “We acknowledge Sri Lanka’s deep unsustainable debt situation and the Sri Lankan authorities’ recent efforts to engage their official and commercial creditors toward a solution to restore debt sustainability under the IMF financial support. We hereby confirm our strong support for Sri Lanka’s prospective EFF-supported programme and commit to supporting Sri Lanka with restoring Sri Lanka’s public debt sustainability under the IMF-supported programme and ensuring that the programme is fully financed as projected by IMF staff.

When contacted by The Sunday Morning, PDASL Chairman Saliya Wickramasuriya said: “Sri Lanka will operate an ‘open acreage’ policy, not a bid round for exploration on a large number of  equal-sized blocks.”   Wickramasuriya stated that each ‘block’ was 225 square kilometres in size and that the PDASL planned to issue three-year exploration licences for entities that expressed interest with a good  operational plan.   Earlier, Sri Lanka had demarcated only the seabed area into 20 blocks.  “All those blocks were chosen for different geological boundaries. However, now we have made the entire area into blocks of the same size – 225 sq. km each. This allows interested parties a better pick from the acreage. This makes it possible for more than one entity to operate in a single area,” he told The Sunday Morning.  Wickramasuriya added that Sri Lanka had now dropped the previous system of getting  interested parties to sign a production contract even before they started exploring in order to attract more interest. When asked about the interest in the Sri Lankan seabed’s petroleum resources,  Wickramasuriya said it was significant, with many international companies keen on explorations.   “One company is ready to go and drill based on the data it has. It has studied the data and is prepared to initiate a test drilling on the site,” he said, adding that the biggest interest in local oil and gas exploration came from Indian firms.  According to the PDASL Chair, those interested in the 900 blocks will be served on a first-come-first-served basis, with a review process each quarter in order to secure the best outcome for Sri Lanka.  “We are only going to assign blocks (exploration licences) to credible entities who make a commitment with a sound plan. It is not going to be a flippable, swappable, or tradeable licence. Sri Lanka has to select partners carefully. First-come-first-served is on a three-month basis,” he explained.  Responding to a question about Indian interest in explorations, Wickramasuriya said that ONGC Videsh Limited, a fully-owned subsidiary of the Indian State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), among others, had expressed interest in the Sri Lankan exploration area.  “It’s not just discussions. There has been actual technical interest. They have come here and done some studies; they have bought a lot of data from us. There is genuine interest from India’s national oil company,” Wickramasuriya said.

The Monetary Board of the CBSL, at a meeting held on Friday (3), decided to raise the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank by 100 basis points to 15.50% and 16.50% respectively, effective from the close of business on the same day.   Issuing a press release, IMF Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka Peter Breuer said the move was supported by the international agency.   “CBSL’s decision to raise the policy rate is appropriate and in line with its objectives set under the inflation targeting framework. It reflects CBSL’s commitment to the inflation target and is an important part of the disinflation strategy in the EFF programme, which is fully committed by the Sri Lankan authorities and supported by the IMF,” Breuer stated.   The rate hike and the subsequent statement comes as Sri Lanka struggles to secure IMF Board approval for the $ 2.9 billion EFF, which is expected to be secured by the end of the month.    Board approval for the EFF has been delayed several times, due to lack of assurances from some creditors, especially China, raising concerns domestically about the feasibility of the much-needed bailout.   Breuer stated: “Sri Lanka’s inflation is declining but remains at a very high level which has been disproportionately hurting the poor. Upside inflation risks could reverse the trend and lead to persistently high inflation which is extremely costly to the economy. Therefore, the CBSL’s decision to raise the policy rate shows its commitment to reduce inflation more quickly and firmly towards the single-digit target.    “Durable disinflation will help boost market confidence, reduce excessive risk premia, and ease financing conditions for the corporates, especially Small- and Medium Enterprises, which will support recovery.”     ",TRUE,CIZLop1eNQgLt0ggozjxXC5H1Zm1,Wasantha Warnakulasuriya,0,Last week’s hiking of rates by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) is in line,,0,1677956471,0,0tL6eaC9tiDl1XNcPnYj,,

Issuing a statement yesterday (25), the trade unions claimed that the position has been vacated since 27 August 2023 and it has, in fact,  hindered the proper collection of state tax revenue which has resulted in a loss of millions tax revenue.    The CIECTU said that not appointing a Commissioner General for IRD is an attempt to collapse the three institutions; the IRD, Sri Lanka Customs, and Excise Department.   It is further stated that even though the country’s economy has collapsed and depleted state revenue, these three departments have been able to earn the targeted income.    The trade unions also mentioned that the policies that the authorities should implement in order to overcome the economic crisis could not be implemented properly if these three institutions would not be administered well.   They stated that in the middle of October 2023, the Sri Lanka Customs has earned an income of Rs. 715 billion and that target has been achieved by the Customs in the background of banning the import of nearly 1, 000 types of goods that could generate further tax revenue for most of the revenue year.   “Accordingly, the Customs has been able to surpass the amount of Rs. 695 billion collected by the Customs in the year 2022 within the first nine months of this year. Also, the Sri Lanka Customs will be able to earn a historic tax revenue in the year 2023, including the amount of tax earned in the next few months. Considering the country’s current economic situation and import restrictions, this is a great achievement,” the statement further read.   It also noted that the trade unions will work together to prevent the prospective danger of any attempt to collapse these three institutions and will always work to provide efficient service at this time when the people are experiencing a severe crisis.

Needless to say, it is a growing crisis that will lead to a gamut of new sub-crises, potentially affecting a large segment of the population, essentially arising out of neglected health and lack of education of the youth to face an increasingly-challenging world.   A recent survey carried out by the Medical Research Institute (MRI) has thrown up some shocking statistics that should, under normal circumstances, ring alarm bells in the corridors of power. But going by what is taking place in those very corridors these days and the sheer lack of empathy towards those marginalised by the economic crisis, it is only a matter of time before things come to a head.   The MRI research survey has found that household food security has become a critical issue for a majority of households in the country that are struggling to make ends meet. According to the survey, 93% of households have reduced their expenditure on essential things such as health and education, simply to put food on the table.   While the political leadership is carrying on regardless – with a group still clamouring for ministerial positions, others gallivanting around the world, and still others being provided alternate luxury housing simply because the allocated housing is too noisy – according to the MRI survey, a staggering 64% of households have already spent their savings on food while 49% have resorted to pawning their valuables and 34% have borrowed money from friends and relatives just so that they can feed themselves at least once or twice a day.   It must be noted that most households that are finding the going getting tougher by the day are not those that can be classified as poor by any means. They are the middle class who, up until the crisis, managed to consume three meals a day, look after their healthcare needs, educate their children, and still had something left to save for a rainy day. As indicated by the MRI survey, most of those savings are now gone and coping methods being resorted to include begging and ‘risky income-generating activities’. While the ordinary people have to work harder than they ever have, some doing two or three jobs just to make ends meet, the political class continues to be insulated from such travails and continue its merry ways, corruption included.   It is not only the economic crisis itself that has led to reduced incomes and job cuts that are affecting households; what appears to be emptying the pockets of the middle class seems to be the current taxation policy, which is not only taxing their incomes at a low threshold, but also taxing them every time they consume a product or service and even taxing the things they own for which taxes have already been paid with the income that has already been taxed. This cascade of taxes, while arguably necessary in the current context, could at least be made more middle-class friendly simply by increasing the exempt threshold to Rs. 200,000 per month from the current Rs. 100,000, which in the present high inflationary context is peanuts.   It appears that the leadership has insulated itself from the harsh economic reality being faced by the great majority of households simply by taking refuge in ‘economic indicators’ that are not quite reflective of the ground situation. This is because the metrics of choice to justify ‘stability’ these days seem to be decreasing inflation and exchange rate, which incidentally has been described by   Bloomberg   as a temporary occurrence.   In the normal scheme of things, desperate situations call for desperate measures, but it appears that Sri Lanka’s politicians – the very people responsible for the economic crisis – have completely insulated themselves from the growing desperation all around them. It is only the ordinary people who appear to be desperately fighting for survival and somehow finding the means to pay taxes, so that politicians – even the ones that failed the nation and fled the country – can live in luxury at taxpayers’ expense.   While there have been comprehensive tax reforms and upward revision of utility charges that have resulted in strangulating an already-heavily-burdened people, why is it that none of the multitude of lavish perks allocated to politicians have been scrapped or at least cut down to show some sort of solidarity with the people? Why is it that the people have to continue to suffer their indulgence? Is some sort of equilibrium too much to ask? It would not be a bad idea to not just cut down on privileges but also power itself, by paving the way for consulting the people through the electoral process.   If the name of the game is austerity and the regime is serious about cutting down waste and rebuilding, it is incumbent upon the leadership to lead the way by example. It should keep in mind that beneath the veneer of normalcy that pervades the country these days is a simmering hotbed of frustration and despair born out of the struggle to simply make ends meet.   With poverty affecting nearly half of the country’s population, it is worrisome that the issue is not being given the attention it deserves. It does not take rocket science to predict that taking the prevailing calm for granted, or worse, believing that things are okay for the great majority of people, could be political suicide. At the end of the day it is important that the people who are going through immense economic hardship see and feel that their leadership is at least empathetic to their suffering.    Given the rapidly-growing disparity between the haves and the have-nots, to borrow from the political jargon of a former President, the political class may find it increasingly challenging to stay aloof on the issue of growing poverty, due to the speed and extent to which it is spreading. To all those who wish to see, there is every indication of a budding social crisis warranting urgent measures to at least mitigate its impact. Therefore it is about time that the leadership focused on issues such as stunted growth of kids and widespread malnutrition among kids and adults alike and kids who are forced to abandon education in favour of jobs to support the household economy.   While taking comfort in numbers in a shrinking economy is self-defeatist, there is no escaping the fact that the country is on the cusp of a huge socioeconomic as well as industrial crisis, with no new industries being set up and the existing ones either scaling down or shutting down. Adding to this is the brain drain of professionals and uncontained corruption that continues to bleed the country dry.

Sri Lanka had been depressed for 26 years. No investment was forthcoming. Everybody was adopting a vacant approach, but the Chinese investment came and propelled the growth in Sri Lanka. Therefore, we are very grateful for that,” Sabry told the Global Times at the press briefing.  “In Sri Lanka, across the party line, everybody has an excellent relationship with China,” the minister said.  Looking at the last decade or two, most of the investments in Sri Lanka have come from China, ranging from industrial facilities and technological support to agriculture and education, he said, noting that Chinese investment is very important not only for the growth of Sri Lanka but also for many other developing countries.  Regarding the country’s economic problems, the foreign minister said there were multiple factors including bad policies, the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict.  “We are not going to blame somebody else for that and we need to take ownership of that. We had serious policy deficiencies. We are now addressing those issues, overcoming them, and getting back to a sustainable way forward,” Sabry said.  The foreign minister said that the country is stabilizing the economy and is now recovering. “The most important phase now is the growth phase,” for which Chinese investment is very important, he said.  China has a big role to play in helping Sri Lanka to address these issues, he added.  Sabry said that there is a lot Sri Lanka can do together with China, while learning from China’s growth. He also said what China has achieved in recent decades has been unbelievable, adding that taking 800 million people out of poverty is a great achievement.  “For me and my country, China has been a friend. China has been a partner in progress, and it will continue to be a partner in progress in the future,” Sabry said.

This suggestion was made in an editorial on “Child welfare in troubled Sri Lanka: Quo vadis?” which was authored by W.M.M. Arambepola (former Consultant Paediatrician attached to the National Hospital in Kandy) and Prof. A. Jayasinghe (formerly attached to the Peradeniya University's Medical Faculty's Community Medicine Department) and published in the   Sri Lanka Journal of Medicine (31)2   in December, 2022.   Sri Lanka is currently facing its worst social and economic crisis. International rating agencies have been downgrading the country’s creditworthiness, i.e. sovereign rating in the recent past, culminating in the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) defaulting on its foreign loans last year (2022). This poor state of affairs is a result of disastrous economic decisions taken by successive governments and a situation compounded by large scale corruption, the Covid-19 pandemic, the unfavourable global financial situation, and the looming global recession. The sequelae of the current economic crisis are far reaching and affect many spheres of the social life of the people. Acute inflation rose to its highest level by more than 70%, over the last several months, per the CBSL, particularly in the domain of food, which has been detrimental to the most vulnerable people. This has resulted in a severe shortage of foreign reserves in the country, thereby affecting the importation of essential items including food, fuel and medicine. Many have warned that it is the children who bear the brunt of this crisis. As the Covid-19 pandemic is receding, we are now confronted with a fresh challenge in the form of a health catastrophe stemming from the ongoing economic and socio-political crisis.   According to the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), over 5.7 million people including 2.3 million children require humanitarian assistance in Sri Lanka, making it among the top 10 countries with the highest number of malnourished children, and UNICEF expects the numbers to rise further. It was also revealed that children under five are increasingly at risk of severe forms of malnutrition. UNICEF further reported that commodities such as food and fuel are at extremely high prices, and that many staples are beyond the reach of many ordinary Sri Lankans. On 12 September, 2022, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation and UN World Food Programme reported that Sri Lankan children are acutely vulnerable to the worsening situation.   Food inflation continues to rise, leading to a record 94.9% in September, 2022, per the Colombo Consumer Price Index. Many parents have been unable to afford even basic items such as rice, dhal, and vegetables while meat, eggs, and fish have become unaffordable luxuries for many households as per a report in   The Guardian   on “Parents can’t afford meat, eggs, and milk: Children bear the brunt of Sri Lanka’s economic crisis” published on 28 October, 2022.   The Guardian   news report authored by A. Wipulasena and H. Ellis-Petersen further explained instances of children fainting in the middle of class at State schools including those in the heart of the commercial capital of the country, Colombo, after arriving at school starving as their parents can barely afford a meal a day let alone the meat, eggs, and milk that children need, and quoted a teacher as saying that many were missing school owing to the financial hardships which also meant that they could not afford transport, uniforms and shoes, who also added that the teachers who attempt to provide a meal to their students too face difficulties owing to the prices of food. Further, the news report quoted UNICEF's Regional Director for South Asia, George Laryea-Adjei as noting that children are going to bed hungry, unsure of where their next meal will come from. A 43-year-old single mother to a 15-year-old boy, based in the village of Mahavita in Yakkala, the Gampaha District in the Western Province, who earns a small income from a shop operated out of her house, had told   The Guardian   that recently, when she did not have enough money even for dhal, she had foraged kohila (spiny lasia) leaves from the roadside to give her son lunch (“It broke my heart to watch my son eat just kohila and rice. He is a good boy. He eats whatever we have at home without complaining.”). She further added that sometimes, her daughter feels faint and has bad stomach aches. Also, as they could no longer afford milk for tea, she regularly went without breakfast. “I have to live by the day.” Moreover, she could also not afford another much needed school uniform (“As soon as he comes back, we wash it so that he can wear it the next day. Last week, he didn’t go to school because his shoes were torn. I had to take a loan [Rs. 4,000 – more than double the cost of buying him shoes in 2021] from a villager to buy him a new pair of shoes.”) In the same report, another mother, 34, from the same area, with two children (five-year-old boy and nine-year-old girl), explained that she can no longer afford the school fees and that her children were also forced to regularly miss school when they could not afford the bus fare or food (the family live off rice, lentils, and sambol, and on one occasion, she had to rely on a donation of rice) as her husband who was a daily wage earner has found that all the work has dried up. The same news report further elaborates that in poverty stricken regions in the North, parents have started leaving their children in care homes as they can no longer feed them. A child protection official in the Northern Province had confirmed that more and more parents are leaving their children in children’s homes due to financial issues.    “I have personally met parents who say that they can’t provide for their children any more (246 in the Northern region in the first half of 2022, which is, per the Department of Probation and Child Care, almost double the number of children placed in State care during the previous year of 2021, which amounted to 146).” Meanwhile, the report observes a 45-year-old former fruit stall vendor who has no money to restart the stall saying that biscuits and a cup of tea are the only food he has for the day.    According to the Save the Children Fund, two thirds of the families are unable to feed their children. It is predicted that the long term implication on child development could be severe, thus damaging Sri Lanka’s much lauded literacy rate of 92%, which is the best in the region.   Staple foods have become unaffordable and severe malnutrition is already among the highest in the region.   Meanwhile, reports are already emerging of the increase in the prevalence of child abuse, exploitation and violence against children due to the mounting economic pressure.   Another important area for children is the education sector. The Ministry of Education is facing a painful experience due to the lack of funds, thus affecting schoolchildren’s mid day meal/lunch programme while children of vulnerable families are increasingly at risk of dropping out of school.   Policy makers, school authorities, and healthcare professionals should be made aware of these issues, and measures should be taken to minimise the impact of this dire situation on our children. At the macro level, healthcare professionals should take an active role in pushing the administration and political hierarchy to acknowledge that we are facing the worst health care crisis in the country and that its impact on children could be devastating and could result in both physical and psychological harm.   Healthcare professionals are already advocating social justice, prioritising health-related needs and transparent decision making that will help us meet the challenges of the present crisis.   The reallocation of scarce Government funds for the essential needs of the healthcare of women and children plays a vital part in this respect.   Clinicians too, at all times, need to be mindful of cost effective health interventions and developing appropriate protocols for the management and prescribing of generic medicines.   The Government must also ensure that social benefit programmes such as the Samurdhi reach the most needy strata of our population.

Discussing this matter, Public Security Minister Tiran Alles further revealed that these consultations are aimed at addressing the sentiment expressed by certain NGOs that the bill the Government is planning to introduce is too adverse.    In the recent past, both when the Government urged NGOs to register with the National Secretariat for NGOs and when rumours about new laws to monitor NGOs surfaced, many NGOs were concerned. While some of their concerns, such as the one that the Government would use the information that it gathers about NGOs’ activities against those NGOs in the future, are considerably subjective, some concerns pertained to confidentiality in information in funding, funders, stakeholders and project activities and objectives. In this context, NGOs should actively take part in these discussions and make them an opportunity to prevent the passage of any harmful legal provisions as they fear, if they want to see the proposed Bill to be a NGO friendly law.   However, to participate in these endeavours productively, NGOs should identify what their needs and issues are and the necessity of having regulations for NGOs. More importantly, now that the Government has expressed willingness to provide NGOs a platform to express the latter’s concerns, NGOs should also be receptive to the Government’s concerns. While NGOs have a right to seek confidentiality with regard to the above mentioned aspects of their activities, the extent to which such confidentiality is justifiable in terms of safety, confidentiality and autonomy is a matter that requires attention. In fact, in a context where the majority of the NGOs seek some form of transparency, accountability, lawfulness and fairness, especially on the part of the Government in the country, the proposed consultations between the Government and the NGOs are a situation where NGOs could demonstrate those qualities by supporting the positive elements of the proposed Bill. Instead of seeing this proposed Bill in its entirety as an anti-NGO plot hatched by the Government to control NGOs in an unfair manner, this opportunity should be used to direct the Government onto the right path.   The fact that the Government is willing to look into the concerns of NGOs is admirable, and is largely in favour of NGOs, provided that the NGOs use this as an opportunity to raise their concerns. However, the Government’s responsibility does not stop there. The Government needs to be open about its intentions and the necessity of such a legal introduction. While it is unlikely that the two parties would be able to agree on each and every element of the proposed Bill, in order for both the parties to find common ground, the Government should ensure that the proposed Bill has powers only to address the concerns pertaining to transparency and accountability on the part of NGOs, and that it cannot be misused to suppress NGOs activities, especially those against the Government. Most importantly, the Government should allow the relevant stakeholders to follow up on the formation of the said proposed Bill.   At the end of the day, for the above mentioned efforts to bear fruit, both the parties need to be receptive to each other’s concerns. The Government has a right and responsibility to take measures to prevent black money from entering the country and foreign funds from financing terrorism or other forms of illegal activities and also to monitor what sort of programmes are being implemented to change the country’s legal, political, economic and social climates and with what intentions. NGOs have a right to seek laws and regulations that do not interfere with their activities through excessive scrutiny, affect their funding, and jeopardise the safety of those working with NGOs. It is both parties’ willingness to genuinely take into account each others’ concerns, not to further label each other as a threat, that will make the proposed discussions a success.

In the third quarter of 2022, the percentage change of the current price GDP was reported as 45.2% and the Year-on-Year (YoY) GDP growth rate was reported as negative 11.8%. Overall agriculture, industry, and services activities declined by 8.7%, 21.2%, and 2.6% respectively, in the third quarter of 2022.   Issuing a communiqué on releasing National Accounts Estimates, the DCS stated that the YoY GDP growth rate for the third quarter of 2022 had been estimated as an 11.8% of negative growth rate.    Accordingly, the GDP for Sri Lanka for the third quarter of 2022 at the constant (2015) price has declined to Rs. 2,884,018 million from Rs. 3,269,510 million recorded in the third quarter of 2021.    In addition, the GDP for Sri Lanka for the third quarter of 2022 at its current price has increased up to Rs. 6,417,031 million from Rs. 4,418,108 million which was recorded in the same quarter in 2021, registering 45.2% of positive change in the current price GDP.    This expansion of the GDP at current prices clearly indicates the influence of the high inflation that prevailed throughout this quarter. The three major economic activities of the economy – agriculture, industry, and services – have contributed their share to the GDP at current prices by 8.7%, 34.5%, and 54.1% respectively.

On Monday (20), Chief Opposition Whip and Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Lakshman Kiriella accused the Government of intentionally violating the relevant Standing Order, which specifies that the COPF chairman should be a member of the Opposition. Kiriella argued that the appointment of United National Party (UNP) MP Vajira Abeywardena as Acting Chairperson was therefore invalid.   “The relevant Standing Order is being intentionally violated. How can a Government MP become the Acting Chairperson? The spirit of the section of the relevant Standing Order is that it should always be a member of the Opposition. This is an action ruining the good reputation of the Parliament. Please change this.    “We saw in newspapers and websites, but we have not been informed that the COPF had been convened and had appointed Abeywardena as Acting Chairman. According to Standing Order 121/1, an Opposition MP should be appointed, even if it is a temporary appointment. At first, the COPF chairpersonship was not given to us but to a Government nominee. However, after that, for a brief period, it was given to us,” Kiriella stated.    Responding to Kiriella’s claims, Abeywardena stated that he had been appointed according to the provisions of the Standing Order and the Constitution. He explained that he had been nominated and confirmed as Acting Chairman after Opposition MP Patali Champika Ranawaka had refused to take up the duties and responsibilities of the post.   “We came to know about the resignation of the Chairman through a media report. The Chairman should inform the Speaker in writing regarding the resignation. However, as it was fixed by Dissanayake, the COPF was convened. When a chairperson has not arrived or is unavailable, another MP who is a member of the COPF should take up the chair, according to which Opposition MP Patali Champika Ranawaka’s name was nominated.    “However, he refused to take up the duties and responsibilities. Since Dissanayake resigned, my name was nominated and confirmed. According to the Constitution and the Standing Orders, the committee proceedings were concluded,” Abeywardena stated.   Thereafter, the Speaker announced in Parliament that the parliamentary Committee of Selection would meet on 4 April and appoint a chair to the COPF.   The COPF met for the first time on 23 February under the patronage of newly-appointed Chairman Mayantha Dissanayake. Dissanayake was nominated by the ruling party MPs of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP).      Opposition calls for a better political culture   However, SJB MP Eran Wickramaratne, speaking to   The Sunday Morning   on Friday (24), rejected Abeywardena’s explanation, insisting that the Government had to appoint an MP from the Opposition in accordance with the Standing Orders. He argued that Sri Lanka must create a better political culture and criticised the Government for not supporting this.   “There is no change in the situation. The Government must appoint someone from the Opposition as per Standing Orders. As per the new culture we were trying to create when we were in office, generally the leadership of the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) and Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) is also given to the Opposition, although there is no requirement to do so. Everything can’t be worked only through law – Sri Lanka must also create a better culture of political accountability. But clearly there is no appreciation of that.”   Wickramaratne also accused the Government of trying to create dissent in his party by nominating Mayantha Dissanayake’s name for the COPF chairmanship, which attempt he said had failed. He argued that if the President had wanted an Opposition that would blindly support his agenda, it was an oversight on his part.   “They just wanted to create some dissension by nominating Dissanayake’s name, but it didn’t work. After Dissanayake understood that Dr. Harsha de Silva’s name had been nominated and that it was the decision of the Leader of the Opposition, MP Dissanayake immediately withdrew his name.    “Ranil Wickremesinghe asked for the assistance of the Opposition with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme. If the President cannot prevail on basic things like the role of the Opposition in Parliament and the Opposition becoming a check and balance and if he wants an Opposition that will blindly support him, then that just won’t happen,” Wickramaratne stated.      New appointment on 4 April   Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) MP and COPF member Dr. Suren Raghavan said that he expected a new appointment to be made on 4 April as per the Speaker’s announcement.    “The Speaker has already given a directive and I believe that this matter will be settled on 4 April. If there is more than one name nominated, a vote will have to be taken to decide the chair.”   The COPF is a critical parliamentary committee that oversees public spending and ensures transparency and accountability in Government finances. Its chairmanship has traditionally been given to a member of the Opposition, even though there is no legal requirement to do so.   The controversy surrounding the appointment of the chairman is therefore significant as it raises concerns about the Government’s commitment to upholding parliamentary rules and promoting transparency and accountability within the Government. It also highlights the need for Sri Lanka to create a better political culture that values the role of the Opposition in holding the Government accountable.

Speaking to   The Daily Morning   yesterday, the Speaker noted that the members of all independent commissions will be appointed by the CC by the end of this week. “Appointing members to all the independent Commissions will be concluded by the end of this week. Almost all the appointments have received the approval of the CC. So, this process is almost done. Therefore, the new members will be able to start their duties of the independent commissions as soon as possible,” he said.   In February, the CC called for applications from members of the public who possess the requisite qualifications to be appointed as members of independent commissions. Later, the CC went through the applications that they received, shortlisted them and tabled them at CC meetings for the final approval.   The Commissions in question are the Election Commission, the Public Service Commission, the National Police Commission, the Audit Service Commission, the Human Rights Commission, the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, the Finance Commission, the Delimitation Commission, and the National Procurement Commission.

The deceased was identified as a notorious drug dealer named Prasad Priyankara alias “Chanthu” from Andiambalama, who was recently granted bail in a drug-related case.  The 30-year-old, an accused in multiple crimes, is reportedly an accomplice of “Heenatiyana Mahesh” who operates his drug syndicate from Dubai, UAE.  According to reports, “Chanthu” had previously injured a police officer in a gunfire that ensued during a raid.     The gunmen had opened fire at “Chanthu” who was travelling on a motorcycle at around 10.20 p.m. yesterday. He had fled the scene following the shooting incident.  Meanwhile, a magisterial inquest and a post-mortem on the deceased’s body are expected to be conducted today.

Appearing on behalf of the AG, an officer of the Department informed this to the Court of this when the writ petition filed by Fernando, requesting the issuance of an order to prevent his arrest, was taken up for consideration. The writ petition was taken up before the bench consisting of Justices Sobitha Rajakaruna and A. Marikkar.    The officer raised these preliminary objections and requested that the relevant petition be dismissed without being taken up for hearing. He charged that through this petition, the petitioner has concealed facts from the Court as well as presented facts that mislead the Court. He said that the petitioner has stated in the petition that there are preparations to arrest him based on media reports and also that his accusation is entirely based on media reports. The counsel informed the Court that the petitioner had filed a Fundamental Rights petition with this request before the Supreme Court, but that this fact has been concealed in this petition. Providing further information, he said that an investigation will be conducted regarding this petitioner under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. He alleged that the malicious actions of the petitioner are revealed through this petition and therefore requested the Court to dismiss it without issuing a notice for hearing.    However, the further consideration of the petition was adjourned until 19 June while attorney Jagath Wickramanayake is scheduled to present facts on behalf of the petitioner on that day.    Fernando, in his petition filed through his attorneys, alleges that the CID is preparing to arrest him, accusing him of having committed an offence under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Act through a statement he made during a religious sermon.

However, the Minister was further confused by what seemed like support extended to Kaviratne by the President. This in turn has given way for the rumour that Kaviratne received the support of the President since she plans to defect from the SJB to join the Government.  The clash was recently witnessed in Parliament when Kaviratne and Ranasinghe had exchanged words over an issue pertaining to the allocation of Mahaweli lands. Kaviratne at the time had claimed that the President had cancelled the land distribution list that was allegedly prepared in an unfair manner following objections raised by her.

I am Sumaiya Nasrudeen, a 23-year-old software undergraduate who has completed a Pearson BTEC HND in software engineering with a distinction. I’m currently working full-time for an IPG solution firm as a system support engineer. Additionally, I’m a freelance model. I had different aspirations as a kid about what I wanted to achieve and who I wanted to become but I think I was mostly driven by curiosity and different interests as I grew older.      Tell us a little about your career apart from modelling.       I’m a software undergraduate. And I was a high achiever of the Pearson BTEC HND I hold. I’m a full-time system support engineer who deals with payment solution support. Since I was 17, on a day-to-day life basis, I have dealt with a lot of numbers, coding, and queries more than anything else, I’d say.      Did you jump into the modelling world as a freelancer from day one, or were you modelling full-time initially?       I started off as a freelance model a year and a half ago. Although I always wanted to become a fashion model, I had to go slow and was only able to commit part-time as I always had a full-time career that required my commitment. And to be honest, I have had a very slow and smooth run as a model. I believe in the idea that the right opportunities will find me rather than trying to grab just any opportunity.      What do you believe is the most undervalued aspect of freelance modelling?       In general, freelance modelling is undervalued as people assume it’s easy and nothing much. Just like full-time models working with agencies, I believe freelancers play a significant role too, especially with all the barriers to access to the industry and lack of opportunities. As a freelancer, you have to do every bit of work all alone – from the initial conversations, planning, negotiations, etc. Even when it comes to building your portfolio and planning on concept shoots, there’s a lot of work behind the scenes that people fail to see.      How do you balance freelance modelling gigs with your full-time career?       I’m actually so thankful and happy about having a very supportive work environment. They understand and support my side hustle. And I always believe you need to choose your career path based on how you’d want things to be in the long run. As much as I’m passionate and very much interested in the idea of being recognised as a successful fashion model in the future, I also give prominence to my full-time job and the tech field as I’ve always wanted to pursue my career in data science.      Tell us a little about the brands you’ve worked with in the past. Which one is your top favourite pick, and why?       As a freelance model, the opportunities available are very limited with high barriers to access to the fashion industry. I have worked with a very limited number of clients and brands. So far, I have worked with ethnic/Indian wear brands, emerging designers, and on catalogue shoots. I love desi looks on me so I’d say those shoots have been my favourites.      What is one piece of advice you’d give to people who are looking to get into freelance modelling?        It’s not as easy as it seems and not as hard as you think if you really want to succeed in it. Be creative and passionate, build a good portfolio, always try to stay connected to the industry, and more than anything, be patient. It’s okay to have a very slow and smooth run; you don’t have to compare yourself or be successful like someone else, just make sure you’re doing better than you did yesterday. Believe in yourself and trust the process. Also, be ready to face the negative/hate comments and criticism; trust me, that will always make you do better the next time, particularly when you take them in the right way to build you rather than to break you.

Speaking during a seminar held in the southern town of Weligama, Peiris said that the legal fraternity should now allow the executives to put the judges under stress.      “We have seen that the executive is unwilling to obey court orders and attempts are being made to systematically ignore court rulings,” Peiris said.     “We must not allow the executive to put the judges under stress,” Peiris further stressed in a reference to the ongoing spat over the non holding of the local council elections.     The Supreme Court earlier this month issued an interim order asking the state officials not to hinder the election by not releasing the funds.     At least two government parliamentarians had raised a privileges issue in parliament over the interim order which they claimed was an abuse of parliamentary privileges.     Peiris said that the executive meaning the President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s decision to not conduct the election was unacceptable and the use of parliament to bring pressure on the judiciary was an unhealthy development.     “All of us must fight against it,” Peiris was quoted as saying by PTI.

Speaking to the media, the Petroleum General Employees’ Union President Ashoka Ranwala said: “All trade unions within the CPC joined together and started a satyagraha campaign on Monday (27). We did not launch a strike as we did not want to cause inconvenience to the public. Instead, we wanted to solve this with Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera, but he did not listen to us and arbitrarily made the decision to hand over petroleum related operations to multinational companies with the support of the Cabinet of Ministers. Considering this, we had a meeting at 12 noon today (28). During the meeting, all the trade union members said that this cannot be solved by only launching a ‘satyagraha’ and said that we should go on a strike. That's why everyone said that we should stop the filling and distribution of petroleum from 12 noon. Accordingly, we have completely moved away from filling and distributing fuel. By now, fuel distribution is completely disrupted. The satyagraha has stopped and we have launched a continuous strike now.”   Meanwhile, Wijesekera said yesterday evening that he had instructed the CPC and the Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Limited (CPTSL) Chairmen to take action against trade union activists and employees who disrupt the distribution of fuel.    “I have instructed the Chairmen of the CPC and the CPSTL to take necessary disciplinary steps to consider the termination of employment and any legal steps necessary against trade union activists or employees that are disrupting the distribution of fuel, disrupting the work of other employees or are acting in violation of the essential services orders,"" he Tweeted.   The Cabinet on Monday approved the proposal presented by Wijesekera to enter into a contract with the Sinopec Fuel Oil Lanka Limited, the United Petroleum Company of Australia and the R.M. Parks Inc. of the United States of America for the importation, storage, distribution and sale of petroleum in Sri Lanka on long-term contracts in collaboration with Shell PLC.   Several trade unions within the CPC, which is currently the largest petroleum company in Sri Lanka, including the Petroleum Trade Unions’ Collective had launched a satyagraha campaign against the Government's decision, which continued for the second day yesterday.   Speaking to the media, the President of the Sri Lanka Podujana Progressive Employees' Collective – Petroleum, Bandula Saman Kumara said that the prepared privatisation of the petroleum sector is not an issue which will only affect the trade unions and CPC employees, but the entire country. He also said that there is no possibility to reduce fuel prices just by allowing private companies to carry out petroleum related operations.    “If the multinational companies are allowed to come in with investments as there is a possibility of reducing fuel prices by doing so, Wijesekera should make an explanation as to how it will be done. We challenge him to come forward and explain to the people about it. He cannot do it. We all know that fuel prices cannot be reduced just because multinational companies are allowed to carry out operations. They (fuel prices) are always determined based on factors such as the foreign exchange rate and petroleum prices in the world market,” he said.   Speaking further, Saman Kumara, who represents a trade union affiliated to the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), said that the SLPP-led Government has no right to privatise State owned enterprises (SOEs) as the policies presented by the SLPP when it was coming to power were totally for preserving national resources.    “Although the President and Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policies Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is known to be a leader who is into selling national resources, the SLPP, according to its policies, cannot do it.”   Another trade union activist, who spoke to the media during the “satyagraha” campaign, said: “The petroleum consumers had to face various hardships due to multinational companies which were carrying out petroleum related operations in the country before 1961. It was in such a situation that then Prime Minister Sirima Bandaranaike and then Minister of Commerce, Trade, Food, and Shipping T.B. Ilangaratne took steps in 1961 to establish the CPC. Reversing their brave decision in this way is a national crime. The people will suffer the consequences of this decision not today, but in some time. Even if the price of a litre of diesel goes up to Rs. 1,000, neither the Government nor the consumers will have anything to do as this decision will take the petroleum duopoly of the Government away.”   Established in 1962 and wholly owned by the Government of Sri Lanka, the CPC is the largest oil company in Sri Lanka. It was formed under the programme to nationalise and expropriate all private oil companies in the country which was initiated by the Bandaranaike-led Government.

The federal agency also arrested another suspect, identified as Sanofar Ali, for allegedly taking part in plans to carry out terror attacks in the country.   NIA officers familiar with the developments said IS member Sheikh Hidayatullah was allegedly in touch with Maulvi Zahran bin Hashim, the ringleader of the deadly Easter Sunday bombings in Sri Lanka on 21 April 2019 that claimed over 250 lives.   Both Hidayatullah and Sanofar Ali were arrested in Tamil Nadu, an NIA officer said.   “Investigations have revealed that the accused persons had entered into a criminal conspiracy in the interior of the forested regions of Asanoor and Kadambur areas of Sathyamangalam forest, Erode district, in February 2022,” NIA said in a statement. “The meetings were led by previously arrested accused Umar Farooq and participated by deceased accused Jameesha Mubeen (who died in the Coimbatore blast), along with Mohammed Azharuddin, Sheikh Hidayatullah, and Sanofar Ali, where they conspired to prepare for and execute terror acts.”   Jameesha Mubeen, who was questioned by NIA in 2019 for alleged terror links, was charred to death under suspicious circumstances after the LPG cylinder inside a Maruti 800 he was driving exploded near Kottai Eswaran temple in Coimbatore’s Ukkadam on the morning of 23 October. The incident took place around 200 metres from a police patrol.   The deceased was registered as the prime accused in the blast case. The state police had invoked the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in the case, which was later handed over to NIA.   According to NIA officers cited above, Hidayatullah, who has been propagating IS ideology since 2017, was earlier arrested along with Azharuddin in June 2019. He was released on bail in 2020. Azharuddin from Ukkadam and leader of the Kerala-Tamil Nadu IS module is currently in jail for the Sri Lanka bombings.   All the above accused were inspired by Hashim, who masterminded and executed the Sri Lanka bombings – in which 252 people were killed – and planned to carry out similar attacks in two South Indian states at that time.   Prior to the Sri Lanka bombings, Hidayatullah and Hashim were in touch through a Facebook page “KhilafahGFX”, according to NIA’s charge sheet filed against Hidayatullah in 2019.

Speaking to the media at the commencement of the programme to distribute rice to low income families in the Weeraketiya and Angunakolapelessa areas yesterday (27), Amaraweera said that the Government has decided to increase the previously allocated sum of Rs. 10 billion to purchase paddy during the Maha season to Rs. 20 billion. ""As of now, the Government is to distribute 10 kilos of rice to low income families for two months. However, President Wickremesinghe has paid attention to continuing this programme for several more months if a need arises. If this programme cannot be continued, the Government is ready to provide such families with an allowance,” he added.   He further said that the programme to provide low income families with rice was commenced in the Districts of Hambantota, Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Galle, Matara, Ratnapura and Kegalle with effect from yesterday. Although there are allegations that the Government is implementing this programme in view of the upcoming Elections, Amaraweera said that the Government is not working targeting elections.

Security SOC stands firm on ‘threat’,news," Chair Dr. Sarath Weerasekera claims foreign experts consulted on tech. aspects of cyber security     The Sectoral Oversight Committee (SOC) on National Security stated that there would be no change in their observation that the proposed privatisation of the Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) poses a threat to national security, but that the Government is free to make any decision on the matter.   In a recent report, the SOC on National Security had informed the Parliament that they would not recommend the privatisation of the SLT as it poses a threat to national security. It was later reported that the SOC had not made any inquiry from the relevant authorities responsible for national security before preparing the report.   When queried by   The Daily Morning   regarding the allegation, SOC Chairman Dr. Sarath Weerasekera said that the report had been prepared after making the necessary inquiries from all the relevant parties including foreign experts on national security. ""Some say that we should have inquired from the Tri-Forces Commanders, but there is no need for them to be queried about cyber security. They should be reached out to only if it is a matter pertaining to physical security. This is something related to the technical aspect, and we have therefore consulted experts in the field of cyber security, including those from other countries, before preparing the report.""   In response to a query as to whether there will be any change to the SOC's observation with regard to the matter, he said that they would continue to stand by their observations. ""In the report, we have pointed out how data could be leaked to outsiders, what the possibilities are for adverse effects, and many other issues that may arise. So, there will be no change to our observations. We will stand by our report. The Government can take whatever decision that they want. We have pointed out that there will be a detrimental effect to national security if the SLT is privatised.""  Against the backdrop of the SOC on National Security stating that it would not recommend privatising the SLT as matters sensitive to national security could be exposed, the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilisation, and National Policies, that is under President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is also the Minister of Defence, recently stated that they were not ready to reverse its reform agenda for any reason. Speaking to  The Daily Morning  , the State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe said that the Government could assure that nothing harmful to the country’s national security would take place during and after the SLT privatisation process.   Meanwhile, the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna recently stated that it is best to appoint an expert committee to look into the matter, and to take further steps according to its recommendations.

It is reliably learnt that the CPC is owed the colossal amount of Rs. 234 billion in arrears for the sale of fuel by nearly 20 State and private institutions. Among them are several Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and large-scale State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) like SriLankan Airlines and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).    It is in the backdrop of the CPC holding billions in arrears that the Government recently increased the fuel tariff, citing international market fluctuations.     When contacted, Ministry of Power and Energy Secretary M.P.D.U.K. Mapa Pathirana would not confirm or deny the figure, but stressed that all efforts were being made by the CPC and the ministry to recover arrears, with consultations ongoing with the Treasury on how to claim the arrears from the many State institutions.     Pathirana would not comment on a timeline for the arrears to be collected.

According to the IMF staff’s baseline scenario, $ 16.9 billion in debt reduction is required during the 2023-27 period, including the arrears accumulated amounting to $ 2.8 billion in 2022, for Sri Lanka to close the external financing gap of $ 25.1 billion.   Sri Lanka has been in arrears to external private creditors since the April 2022 moratorium, including $ 1,633 million to International Sovereign Bond (ISB) holders, $ 338 million to China Development Bank (CDB), and $ 7 million to other foreign commercial creditors as of December 2022.   Meanwhile, the Exim Bank of China’s financing assurances also include a moratorium on debt service payments due through 2023.    Based on the IMF calculations, Sri Lanka is expecting a $ 3.37 billion debt reduction in 2023 and $ 3.32 billion in 2024.   During the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme (2023-27), the official programme financing will include about $ 3 billion from the IMF over four years, and $ 3.75 billion from other multilateral institutions.    Moreover, the IMF statement said that China has consented to fund financing notwithstanding arrears to the Chinese Government and the China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation (the guarantor for several Chinese commercial loans that are in default). Sri Lanka also owes official arrears to Iran, Kuwait, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia. All four need more time to consider consenting to Fund financing notwithstanding these arrears.   Also, it said that the monetary financing ceiling set by the IMF on the Central Bank until June 2023, is set at the level recorded at the end of January 2023, and that ceiling will be reduced further by another Rs 150 billion in H2 2023.

,,Hoteliers choose fines over liquor licenses,news,"  Strap 1:  Paying fines on multiple occasions is cheaper than buying a license  Strap 2:  Policies to tackle unmonitored sales are at early stages  By Ranshitha Kularatne     The Sunday Morning Business  learns that small-scale hotels are choosing to refrain from buying expensive liquor licenses as being penalised in raids, even multiple times a year, is a cheaper option for them. Speaking to  The Sunday Morning Business , The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) Chairman Sanath Ukwatte said that a liquor license issued by the Department of Excise costs approximately Rs. 1.5 million for star class hotels, whereas hoteliers who wilfully skip the license have to pay only Rs. 500,000-600,000 per year, in fines. He suggested increasing penalty charges as a means of encouragement for hoteliers to acquire their liquor license. Several factors are taken into account in determining the cost of the liquor license. The grades of the hotels they are being sold at, types of liquor, liquor ingredients, and category of the establishment they are being sold from are some such dimensions. The Department of Excise agreed that the lengthy process of acquiring a liquor license discourages small-scale hoteliers. Once a liquor license is applied for, an assessment is conducted pertaining to the establishment’s eligibility to sell liquor.  In order to qualify, the seller needs to meet requirements laid out by the Sri Lankan Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA), and has to adhere to guidelines set by the Department of Excise. The Department of Excise Deputy Commissioner Kapila Kumarasinghe told  The Sunday Morning Business  that reluctance among small-scale hoteliers to attain liquor licenses takes place because of their fear of being unable to cover the license charges through sales. Discouraged by the excessive prices, and in cases where hotels don’t meet the SLTDA criteria, small-scale hotels and restaurants tend to sell alcohol without a license. Further, Kumarasinghe stated that he was unable to estimate a figure pertaining to the loss in revenue to the Government caused by this malpractice, as a formal investigation was not carried out so far. When  The Sunday Morning Business  questioned him about monitoring measures in place to track illicit liquor sales, Kumarasinghe said: “Such sales are called unmonitored sales. Unregulated production of alcohol, illegal alcohol imports, and selling alcohol without a license come under unmonitored sales. These are being overlooked by the Excise Department, while plans to improve this process are now being drafted. “The Excise Department plans to introduce a sticker system from 1 January, 2019 to identify legally imported and manufactured alcoholic beverages. From January, 2019 a sticker will be on every legally manufactured or imported liquor bottle.  “Groundwork for that project is being laid these days. The usual raids are also taking place through excise officers in divisional areas. Apart from that, a plan to completely computerise and maintain updates on Excise Department records is set to take place by 2020.” Meanwhile, the suggestion to open more nightclubs and build more attractions to retain tourists in Colombo was brought forward by Tourism Development Minister John Amaratunga during a media briefing on Tuesday (23).  During the celebratory occasion on Sri Lanka being nominated as the No. 1 destination for tourists in 2019 by the prominent travel website Lonely Planet, Amaratunga highlighted the need to open more nightclubs in Colombo.  He claimed that although there are regulations on selling liquor and opening nightclubs, they can be negotiated, and that all the hotels currently hold licenses to sell liquor. On being asked if the Government currently places restrictions on the opening of nightclubs, he stated that since they are considered private businesses, there are no such restrictions in place, apart from the usual regulations.

,,National Electronic Waste Collection Programme from today (05),news,"The inauguration ceremony of the National Electronic Waste Collection Programme 2020, in commemoration of the National Electronic Waste Management Week will be held today (05) at the Cinnamon Gardens Post Office premises.

The inaugural ceremony will be held under the patronage of Minister of Mass Media Keheliya Rambukwella and State Minister S. Viyalendiran.

The National Electronic Waste Management Week - 2020, will be held on October 05 with the theme “Sri Lanka is a Breathtaking Country, Electronic Waste Free Sri Lanka”. This initiative was done in collaboration with the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) and the Department of Posts of Sri Lanka on the occasion of the World Postal Day which falls on October 09.

“Even the management of perishable waste has become a major problem in the existing waste management structure in the country and non-perishable waste management should be considered as another issue identified there,” said the Chairman of the Central Environmental Authority S. Amarasinghe.

“Electronic and electronic waste is currently being disposed of only through 14 agencies licensed under the Central Environmental Authority for the proper collection and disposal of electrical and electronic waste. There are factories in Italy, Germany and France that recycled e-waste on a large scale and plans should be made to move towards such projects as a country in the future,” he stated.

He further said that SLT and Mobitel will provide financial assistance for this e-waste collection program.

In today's technological world, the use of electronic devices is increasing day by day and at the same time the lifespan of electronic devices is decreasing. PB Hemantha Jayasinghe, Director General of the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) said, ""These electronic devices contain a variety of toxic chemicals, which can have a significant impact on the environment as well as groundwater.""

He further said that although the collection of non-perishable waste is active to some extent within the urban limits, it does not take place within the rural limits and there is a high risk of this waste being released into the environment on a large scale.

,,We should be consulted more: Chartered surveyors,news," By Heshan De Silva  Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) highlighted the importance of consulting certified Chartered surveyors for constructions as well as land and property developments to enhance quality and durability. RICS, Secretary D. Prathapasinghe said the real estate sector in Sri Lanka is extremely disorganized and that the construction and property development sectors have a large number of unqualified personnel.  “The time has come to regulate the real estate industry. There’s no proper regulatory mechanism to monitor it. This is now an industry that anybody who has money can enter, which is not appropriate comparing with developed countries and their standards. These unqualified people do evaluations, marketing and various tasks, but finally as a result of unprofessional practices investors risk losing large amounts of money. We request all the policymakers, professionals and responsible authorities to be aware of the importance of seeking professional advice.” He made these comments at a press conference held last week, which was attended by the board members of the RICS in both government and private sectors. Prathapasinghe stated there were number of unsuccessful constructions projects both in the government sector and the private sector, and that most of these projects had stopped because the cost evaluations were wrong and consulting unqualified people had increased the cost of the projects.  “There were lots of projects just stopped at the initial state because investors failed to consult professional advice. They neglect the project viability, finance viability, economic viability and market viability which could only be evaluated by Chartered qualified individuals because they are the only members who have the scope.” According to Prathapasinghe, most people do not know about value estimation of lands and properties, cost of constructions and taking approvals for building constructions. “As professionals we must improve real estate literacy levels. Rarely a person takes professional advices before purchasing a land or constructing a house. There is no professional culture being developed in our country comparing with developed countries,” said Prathapasinghe. RICS Executive Board Member Prof. Chitra Weddikkara said: “Nowadays there are constructions projects carried against municipal council provisions, so as a result those types of projects have been suspended by Court orders. These unskilled people come without knowledge related to field. People have this belief that Chartered qualified members charge high consultation fees which is not correct. Our qualified members will charge according to the project.” “There are some construction projects without Certification of Council (COC), so these property owners never able to get a bank loan,” she added.  According to Weddikkara, there are 16 institutions that provide approvals for a building project to start which generally takes up to a year. To fast-track the approval procedure Urban Development Authority (UDA) has introduced an online approval system.  “UDA introduced an online system to work with approval procedure, but that is at the initial state still. It will be more developed in the long run. For example, in Colombo, the approval procedure should conduct traffic surveys, environmental impact assessment, checking correct deeds and so many other surveys, but in our country people don’t have any knowledge about this,” said Weddikkara.  UDA Director General Eng. S.S.P. Rathnayaka told  The Sunday Morning Business :“We consult professional advice, especially when it comes to construction and development projects. Among them, some projects are halted mostly because funds that were allocated for the original project is later allocated to an urgent projects.”  Rathnayaka said: “In February, 2017 UDA was assigned to authorise building construction projects. Since then Rs. 100 billion worth government and private sector projects have been approved. Generally every building project should obtain the approvals from 13 institutions and 16 for larger projects. Usually it takes a month for 40% of building projects to be approved and 2 months for 60% of projects.” “We always promote professionally qualified advice. We have Chartered architectures and civil engineers to authorise approvals for building construction. Also there are seminars in collaboration with The Institution of Engineers and Chartered architecture,” said Rathnayaka.  Chamber of Construction Industry President Eng. Ranjith Gunathilake told  The Sunday Morning Business  that: “Chartered qualified professionals should be consulted considering the size of the project.” “I agree there were unsuccessful projects in every sector. Especially the government projects, where dealing with public funds the officials must consult skilled professionals to minimise wasting funds, material and labour.”  Gunathilake said: “Sri Lanka maintains cheapest charges for professional consulting. Chartered qualifications always come in international standards, so comparing to other countries one could consult professional advice for a reasonable rate.”  RICS is a globally recognised institution which established in United Kingdom in the year 1868 with 49 members. Present day there are over 125,000 members across 150 countries. Chartered surveyors profession introduced to Sri Lanka in 1948 at the time of independence. Back in the time the institution was called as Survey Generals Department which becomes the first professional qualification institute in Sri Lanka. RICS officially registered in 2003.

,,Supreme Court concludes hearing 20A petitions,news," The Supreme Court (SC) concluded the consideration of petitions filed challenging the draft bill of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution yesterday (5). 

 It was announced that the decision of the court will be sent to the President and Speaker of Parliament in due course. Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya stated in open court that the secret decision of the SC regarding the constitutionality of the draft 20th Amendment will be referred to the President and Speaker of Parliament. 

 During the hearing, Attorney General (AG) Dappula de Livera stated that all the provisions contained in the draft 20th Amendment were in accordance with the Constitution. 

 Pointing out that the President is bound to ensure free and fair elections in accordance with the Constitution, the AG stated that the proposed 20th Amendment Bill had expanded that responsibility while providing the Election Commission (EC) with a strong legal basis for free and fair elections. 

 The AG pointed out that the 20th Amendment proposes to reinstate the President’s immunity lost under the 19th Amendment, which will enable the President to exercise his executive powers vested in him by the Constitution without hindrance. 

 He further emphasised that there was no need for a referendum to approve any of the provisions contained in the draft. In conclusion, AG de Livera stressed in court that the draft could easily be passed by a two-thirds majority in Parliament without a referendum. 

 In addition, AG de Livera refused to give a copy of his written submissions to counsel for the petitioners, when said counsel made an application for it to enable them to respond. 

 Chief Justice Jayasuriya asked the AG whether he could make it available for them even as a soft copy, to which the AG declined to do so. The AG informed Chief Justice Jayasuriya that he would be giving the soft copy to the court today (6). 

 Ultimately, the court made one of its copies available for the petitioners' counsel. 

 Subsequently, the court directed the parties involved in the case to submit their written submissions, if any, before 3 p.m. today (6). 

 Consideration of the petitions commenced for the fourth day last morning before the five-member judge bench chaired by Chief Justice Jayasuriya. The bench consists of SC Justices Buwaneka Aluwihare, Sisira de Abrew, Priyantha Jayawardena, and Vijith Malalgoda. 

 Thirty-nine petitions in total were filed against the draft bill of the 20th Amendment, citing the AG as the respondent. 

 The petitions were put forward by EC member Prof. Ratnajeevan Hoole, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), United National Party (UNP) General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, UNP Deputy Leader Ruwan Wijewardene, SJB Youth Wing Chairman Mayantha Dissanayake, Attorney-at-Law P.

,,Covid-19 disrupting mental health services: WHO,news,"By Sarah Hannan  

 The World Health Organisation (WHO), in its latest survey, records that the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted or halted critical mental health services in 93% of countries worldwide while the demand for mental health is increasing. 

 The survey of 130 countries provides the first global data showing the devastating impact of Covid-19 on access to mental health services, and underscores the urgent need for increased funding. 

 The survey was published ahead of WHO’s global online advocacy event on 10 October that will bring together world leaders, celebrities, and advocates to call for increased mental health investments in the wake of Covid-19. 

 The WHO previously highlighted the chronic underfunding of mental health, stating that prior to the pandemic, countries were spending less than 2% of their national health budgets on mental health and struggling to meet their populations’ needs. It also stated that the pandemic is increasing demand for mental health services.  

 Bereavement, isolation, loss of income, and fear are triggering mental health conditions or exacerbating existing ones. Many people may be facing increased levels of alcohol and drug use, insomnia, and anxiety.  

 Meanwhile, Covid-19 itself can lead to neurological and mental complications, such as delirium, agitation, and stroke. People with pre-existing mental, neurological, or substance use disorders are also more vulnerable to the SARS-CoV-2 infection – they may face a higher risk of severe outcomes and even death.  ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Covid-19 disrupting mental health services: WHO,news,0,1601933416,0,100074,,

 He went on to say that the Government was confident that the importation of beef would take place after the ban.

 Ambassador Shanika Dissanayake introduced the fitness products of Textrip (Pvt.) Ltd. and the Elasto Group to a well-known Jordanian fitness and wellness studio entrepreneur so as to secure a foothold for value-added sports products made out of 100% Sri Lankan natural latex rubber. 

 The introduction was made over a virtual meeting  which was conducted by the Embassy and Elasto Group’s Textrip (Pvt.) Ltd. Manager – International Sales Thakshila Gamage.   

 Gamage, introducing the products via Zoom, showcased how a total mobile workout could be done in the safety of one’s home, navigating a post-Covid scenario without having to visit a physical gym. 

 ""The products were very well received by the Jordanian side, which expressed interest in using the fitness products and resistance bands for their Pilates, barre dance, and aqua fitness activities,"" Dissanayake stated. 

 The Embassy is looking to conduct online meetings with Sri Lankan exporters to support them to connect and build productive relationships with reputed Jordanian importers.  

 The Embassy also conducted a virtual B2B (business-to-business) meeting between a reputed Jordanian health and wellness beverage company and Ranfers (Pvt.) Ltd. in order to introduce their organic branded range of Ceylon Ayurveda teas into the Jordanian market.

,,Environment Act to be amended,news,"By Sarah Hannan  

 The Environment Act of Sri Lanka is to undergo amendments to increase fines and terms of imprisonment against those who violate the Act, Minister of Environment Mahinda Amaraweera revealed. 

 “The fines and terms of imprisonment will be increased by 10 times so as to curb the destruction that is caused to wildlife, forests, and the biodiversity of the country. We are looking to draft amendments to the existing Environment Act and hopefully, we will be able to propose it to the Cabinet of Ministers for approval, after which it would be sent to the Attorney General for approval and enactment,” Amaraweera stated. 

 He further reiterated that speculation on social media about the amount of deforestation around the country within forest reserves was unfounded, and only about four such protected areas were subject to encroachment-related destruction. 

 “Some social media outlets are spreading false propaganda that large-scale environmental damage is being done with the connivance of the Government, which is unfounded. In the past, politicians and powerful people were wronged and freed, but now the common people are being caught and punished for a small mistake. There is no room for that,” Amaraweera elaborated. 

 He added that the law is to be enforced against the perpetrators regardless of their political affiliation or social position, similar to when a politician’s brother was arrested over the destruction that took place in the Anawilundawa Wetland Sanctuary  .

,,No proof of Covid-19 social transmission: Dr. Samaraweera ,news," 
           Still in early stages of recognition   
           Yet to identify how virus got to factory  
 
 By Maheesha Mudugamuwa 

 Despite the source of the new Covid-19 cluster reported from Minuwangoda not being identified yet by the health authorities, Ministry of Health Chief Epidemiologist Dr. Sudath Samaraweera yesterday (5) said there was no proof that there was social transmission of the coronavirus in Sri Lanka. 

 Speaking to the media, Dr. Samaraweera said: “We still don’t know the prevalence of this disease. We are still in the early stages of recognition. People in the Gampaha District in particular are requested to restrict travel and stay in their homes. We have already imposed quarantine and curfew in three police areas. 

 “Another question is whether Covid-19 has been socialised. The socialisation of the disease means that patients are reported from each location whilst connections are not identified and they are spreading it unknowingly. According to the available evidence, there is no reason to say so,” he added. 

 “We identified a group of 71 persons. We still don't know how the virus got to this factory. We are still investigating this. Here, the risk of spread among society is high. So we have to be alert,” he stressed. 

 Furthermore, Dr. Samaraweera said the newly identified positive cases are from a cluster associated with the Brandix factory, and clarified that whether we can say it is socialised will depend on the evidence obtained from future PCR tests and the contribution made by the public towards preventing the spread of the virus. 

 “On average, of 100 people tested at this factory, 69 were confirmed to be infected,” he continued, adding that including the first patient and her daughter, there were 71 patients. 

 Elaborating further, the Chief Epidemiologist noted that the identification of the 69 new positive patients will lead to their associates also being identified. 

 “They also have to be quarantined and undergo PCR tests. It is with that in mind that we have to decide how to expand (testing) in the future,” he added. 

 More Covid-19 cases 

 Two more employees of the apparel factory in Minuwangoda, where the Covid-19 patient from Divulapitiya worked, tested positive for Covid-19. 

 They were treated at the Kurunegala Hospital before being transferred to the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) in Angoda. 

 Army Commander Lt. Gen. Shavendra Silva confirmed that both patients are workers of the apparel factory. 

 In addition, another female apparel factory worker in Minuwangoda tested positive for Covid-19 at the Monaragala Hospital and is being transferred to IDH, Army Commander Silva said. 

 Subsequently, 10 more Minuwangoda apparel factory workers tested positive for Covid-19 late last night, brining the total number of workers to test positive so far to 88, said Army Commander Silva.  

 A 39-year-old woman, employed at a leading apparel factory in Minuwangoda, tested positive for Covid-19 over the weekend and was transferred from the Gampaha Hospital to IDH. 

 Subsequently, 400 of the apparel factory worker’s contacts at the factory were directed for self-quarantine. 

 Meanwhile, the process of conducting PCR tests for over 1,400 employees of the apparel factory commenced last morning (5) at the factory premises. ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,No proof of Covid-19 social transmission: Dr. Samaraweera ,news,0,1601935247,0,100090,,

,,Commemorating Sri Lanka’s animal welfare activists on World Animal Day,brunch," By Naveed Rozais 

 A small gathering was held on 4 October to recognise and facilitate some of Sri Lanka’s tireless animal activists who work towards the betterment and upliftment of community, farm, and wild animals. 

 Held at Park Street Mews, the ceremony was jointly hosted by a group of animal welfare activists, Harpo’s Hotels, Cafes, and Restaurants Founder/CEO Harpo Gooneratne, and the team at Park Street Mews. 

 The gathering was held to honour various animal welfare activists and the people who support them at the ground level to look after and uplift animals in their communities, sometimes at risk of their jobs and personal safety. These kind animal lovers and carers come from all walks of life and all parts of the country, going above and beyond to support other animal welfare activists and community animals. 

 Construction sites tend to be places where dogs congregate, and the staff working at these sites like having these dogs around as the dogs are great companions for them, in addition to providing an element of security by sounding out intruders at night. However, the owners of these sites consider these dogs a nuisance, sometimes going so far as to threaten staff with the loss of their jobs if they’re caught feeding the dogs that congregate at these sites. Despite this, many of the staff at these sites help local animal welfare activists to feed these animals and help treat them when they fall sick, often forming genuine attachments with them. 

 This kind of support from ground staff proves invaluable to animal welfare activists looking to uplift the lives of animals in their communities. The initiative to honour these ground staff and other animals welfare activists was the brainchild of animal welfare activist Visakha Tillekeratne in order to recognise and celebrate not only animal welfare activists, but also those without whom animal welfare activists would be unable to do their work, from street cleaners, security guards, and building site supervisors to three-wheel drivers and domestic helpers. Activists were presented with certificates of appreciation, mugs, and gift vouchers. 

 Activists honoured at the event included Pichchmuththu Paramanathan, Lechuman Jegatheeswaran, Suppiah Dayanidi, R.A. Swarnalatha Weerasekere, Austin Peiris, Desmond Kumara Peiris, Ravi de Silva, Hettiarachchige Seneviratne, Deepika Wanniarachchi, D.D. Chandrani, Chandrika, Hema Kate Lily, N.K. Ruwan Pathirana, Wipulasena Wijenayake, Duniyasha Perera, Anjana Selvanayagam, Nadeeka Dharmaratne, Jonathan Solamon, Manoja Weerakkody, Madri Jayasekera, Manel Jayasekera, Renuka Nagodavithana, Debra Macan Markar, Otara Gunewardene, Anusha David, Abeeth Dangalle, Kumudini Saravanamuttu, Marie Perera, Sahana Ravishankar, Shilpa Samaratunga, Christine Perera, Grero, Rosy Senn, Unee Pathirage, Mahesh Narandas, Shiona Weerasekera, Dominic Perera, Roshan Chitty, Nilmini Welivita, Panchali Panapitiya, Dinesh Gamage, Dr. Ishika Madushani, Dr. Nalinika Obeysekera, Hector and Krishanthi Rondon Fuentes, Surangani de Silva, Ira de Silva, and Lalani Perera. 

 “We have dedicated our lives every day of the year to improve (the lives of) a lot of our four-legged friends. This year we thought it was only fitting that people islandwide who despite straightened circumstances and other impediments continue to do their best for animals and all creatures great and small,” Tillekeratne said. 

 A highlight of the proceedings was the tribute paid to two renowned animal welfare legends, Sagarika Rajakarunanayake and Deepal Wijeweera. 

 Rajakarunanyake has been instrumental in uplifting animal welfare in Sri Lanka, both through her animal welfare organisation Sathva Mithra Group, which she has worked on tirelessly since 1993, and through her personal lobbying to then President Mahinda Rajapakse on instituting the “No Kill Policy” regarding stray dogs in Sri Lanka. Rajakarunanayake brought to the President’s attention the World Health Organisation (WHO) protocol of controlling rabies through catch, neuter, vaccinate, and release, inspiring the President to order the No Kill Policy into effect. 

 Rajakarunanayake addressed the gathering, sharing how satisfying it has been for her to devote her life to working towards animal welfare, and how encouraging it was for her to see how the strength of animal welfare activists and the power of their voice have grown from her initial days working in the field. Rajakaruananayake also shared that as animal welfare activists, we have a duty to lend our voice to the environmentalists and ask what big changes are being made and when. 

 Wijeweera, another tireless animal welfare activist, was also honoured at the ceremony. Wijeweera has become a familiar sight around Colombo over the years, feeding community dogs every day without fail, despite ill health and personal difficulties. Wijeweera was, unfortunately, unable to attend the ceremony due to ill health. 

 Sri Lankan Brand Ambassador for World Animal Day and Embark Founder Otara Gunewardene also spoke on the occasion, speaking on Rajakarunanyake’s invaluable contribution to local animal welfare. 

 The ceremony concluded with a performance by animal welfare activist Nilmini Welivita. ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Commemorating Sri Lanka’s animal welfare activists on World Animal Day,brunch,0,1601935244,0,100094,,
,,National LankaQR initiative launched by Central Bank,business," The National LankaQR Initiative “Rata Puraama LankaQR” was launched yesterday (5)   at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to popularise LankaQR, which was introduced by the CBSL together with licensed financial institutions and LankaClear (Pvt.) Ltd. with the aim of moving towards a “less-cash” society while increasing financial inclusion in Sri Lanka. 

 Minister of Trade Dr. Bandula Gunawardana launched the initiative as the Chief Guest in the presence of State Minister of Money and Capital Market and State Enterprise Reforms Ajith Nivard Cabraal; State Minister of Co-operative Services, Marketing Development, and Consumer Protection Lasantha Alagiyawanna; State Minister of Samurdhi, Household Economy, Microfinance, Self-Employment, Business Development, and Underutilised State Resources Development Shehan Semasinghe; CBSL Governor Prof. W.D. Lakshman; and members of the Monetary Board including Treasury Secretary S.R. Attygalle. Heads of several government departments, financial institutions, as well as leaders of the retail, health, and media industries and representatives from chambers of commerce were also present.  

 LankaQR enables customers to make payments directly from their bank accounts to accounts of merchants or service providers, using payment apps of LankaQR-certified financial institutions. LankaQR is a low-cost digital payment solution which targets small and medium enterprises especially. Customers will not be charged for using LankaQR-based payments. Merchants are provided with the LankaQR-printed sticker free of charge by the member institutions of LankaQR to be displayed at their places of business. The maximum Merchant Discount Rate (MDR – fees paid by merchants to the bank that issues the LankaQR code) will be 0.5% during 2020. In addition, all payments for government services through LankaQR have been mandated to be free of charge during 2020. Given the numerous benefits to the economy and the public, the CBSL and financial institutions aim to increase the availability of LankaQR in Sri Lanka to one million merchants by the end of 2020.  

 CBSL Deputy Governor K.M.M. Siriwardana, welcoming the audience, stated that this initiative would increase financial inclusion in the country, strengthen trade, and lead the economy on the path to prosperity. 

 Dharmasri Kumaratunge highlighted the benefits of LankaQR and noted that it was the result of teamwork of Sri Lankans without any foreign assistance, saving the country millions of rupees. 

 CBSL Governor Prof. Lakshman stated that this is a historic moment where all financial institutions came together energetically to promote a payment system that has immense benefits to the public. State Minister Nivard Cabraal emphasised the importance of adopting new technologies for trade and economic development. Furthermore, recognising the importance of efficient and secure payments and settlement systems for a country, he noted that the CBSL has been modernising Sri Lanka’s payments and settlements systems since the early 2000s and praised the continued adoption of new technologies that provided Sri Lankans with more opportunities for trade and commerce.  

 Chief Guest Minister of Trade Dr. Gunawardana congratulated the CBSL and financial institutions for introducing LankaQR and encouraged all businesses and government services to adopt LankaQR so that the general public can enjoy the benefits of digital payments at a very low cost. The Minister also requested financial institutions to waive off charges for LankaQR transactions below Rs. 100, and requested state media and other media organisations, as well as all businesses to extend their fullest support to this national initiative. To mark the launch of the “රට පුරාම LankaQR” initiative, the Minister made a donation to the “Itukama” Covid fund using a LankaQR-based mobile app.  

 The national campaign of “රට පුරාම LankaQR” will be held on Saturday, 10 October 2020, where all LankaQR-certified banks, finance companies, and e-money service providers will open branches islandwide to onboard new merchants. The public and merchants are invited to participate in the islandwide campaign and begin using LankaQR to make payments. 

 LankaQR-compliant QR codes are currently issued by the Bank of Ceylon, Cargills Bank Ltd., Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC, DFCC Bank PLC, Hatton National Bank PLC, National Development Bank PLC, National Savings Bank, Nations Trust Bank PLC, People’s Bank, Sampath Bank PLC, Sanasa Development Bank PLC, LB Finance PLC, LOLC Finance PLC, People’s Leasing and Finance PLC, Dialog Axiata PLC, and Mobitel (Pvt.)

,,There won’t be a lockdown: Army Commander,news,"While lockdown is an easy strategy, it can be oppressive for the people in the country to carry on their daily struggle for survival, says Commander of the Army Lieutenant General Shavendra Silva.

The Head of the National Operation Centre for Prevention of COVID-19 Outbreak (NOCPCO) mentioned this joining the TV Derana Breakfast Show ‘Derana Aruna’.

With reports of COVID-19 infections, what needs to be done is to identify possible contacts and contain the spread of the virus and not going for a country-wide lockdown, he said.

Three areas – Minuwangoda, Divulapitiya, and Veyangoda – were placed under police curfew as they were identified to be areas where the majority of apparel factory employees resided in, Lieutenant General Silva pointed out.

Following a discussion with the President on several points, it has been decided to maintain the situation as is, he added.

“Nearly 1,400 persons are employed in this company [Minuwangoda apparel factory]. Another 400 are engaged in sanitation services in the company. Apart from 495 among them, the rest reside in the areas where the police curfew is implemented.

The remaining 495 are with addresses from various parts of the country. As their services have been temporarily suspended due to the situation, measures were taken to identify them yesterday (05). Over 125 of them are currently being escorted to quarantine centers operated by the Sri Lanka Army.

The remaining majority are within the police curfew areas. That is why we didn’t go for a lockdown. Although it is easier, we have decided to move the country forward while controlling the situation.”

The Army Commander said that the currently identified COVID-10 patients from the Minuwangoda cluster, they are mainly from addresses in Ampara, Anuradhapura, Badulla, Gampaha, Hambantota, Jaffna, Kegalle, Kurunegala, Matale, Matara, Monaragala, Nuwara Eliya, Polonnaruwa, Puttalam, and Vavuniya.

“Considering the 101 identified [by 9.40 pm last night], nearly 150 including family members have been directed for quarantine. If there are any more remaining they will be directed this morning.

However, the most important point is that, while their families are from other areas, these employees have not returned home within the past 3 weeks or one month. Family members of all those who had visited their homes have been quarantined. Nearly 150 are quarantined in this manner. If others have visited their families they will be taken for quarantine before 12 noon today.”",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,There won’t be a lockdown: Army Commander,news,0,1601963740,0,100119,,

However, the turnover started picking up after the mid-week holiday; thus, the broader market concluded the week on a positive note.

,,Parliament nod to raise Rs. 310 b to manage debt,business," Parliament on Friday (26) passed a resolution to raise Rs. 310 billion by way of loans in or outside Sri Lanka for Active Liability Management by the Government. The Parliament resolved under the Active Liability Management Act of 2018 (ALMA) section 3 that “a sum not exceeding Rs. 310 billion may be raised by the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) by way of loans, in or outside Sri Lanka, for such purposes as specified in the provisions of the Active Liability Management Act No. 8 of 2018”. The Active Liability Management framework is focused on acting in advance, to refinance and/or pre-finance debt repayable beyond the financial year covered under the Annual Appropriation Act. The Liability Management Strategy of GOSL is planned to be implemented to ease the repayment of debt in the future, and ensure that such repayments are done at the lowest possible cost in line with the Government’s cash flow, prevailing and expected interest rates, and the future maturities of public debt. In a statement, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) said that the Active Liability Management Framework and the resolution passed by the Parliament provides much needed legal framework for the Government and the Central Bank to adopt strategies depending on the market conditions. These strategies include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) buy-back or early repayment of identified loans, (b) issue of new loans at low interest rates in place of outstanding loans obtained at higher interest rates, (c) lengthening of the maturity or repayment period of identified loans on new terms by way of switches and/or exchanges,  (d) consolidation or conversion of identified loans into new loans on new terms, (e) raising of new loans outside the given financial year’s borrowing limit approved by the Parliament under the Annual Appropriation Act to benefit from prevailing favourable market conditions and to use such proceeds for early repayment of existing loans obtained at unfavourable terms, (f) maintenance of dedicated bank accounts, i.e. in rupee and foreign currency, to ringfence the money so raised under the resolution passed by the Parliament under section 3 of ALMA, and (g) invest surplus funds in above mentioned bank accounts in appropriate liquid assets. The statement added that the Government and CBSL have already initiated the necessary action within the Active Liability Management Strategy formulated within the legal framework, which is set out under ALMA to diversify market-based foreign funding sources to jurisdictions such as the Chinese Panda market, Japanese Samurai market, and the very liquid Sukuk market. The Government and the CBSL are confident that the Liability Management Strategy being adapted would enable the debt management authorities to proactively address refinancing requirements in coming years, and to extend maturity duration of both domestic and foreign debt in a cost-effective manner. The CBSL also said that the Government is fully cognisant of its outstanding debt liabilities denominated in foreign and local currencies. “In view of the necessity for institutionalising a legal framework for managing the country’s public debt profile in a prudent manner that brings debt sustainability and macroeconomic stability amidst potential impact of exogenous and endogenous shocks, the Parliament enacted the ALMA in March, 2018. The ALMA provides the legal framework for GOSL to raise loans in or outside Sri Lanka for management of public debt in terms of relevant laws, including the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949, the Local Treasury Bills Ordinance (Chapter 417), Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance (Chapter 420), and the Foreign Loan Act No. 29 of 1957.” ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Parliament nod to raise Rs. 310 b to manage debt,business,0,1540569821,0,10013,,

,,Selection perplexity imminent!,sports,"Sports Minister Namal Rajapaksa (on left) and Arjun Fernando (right) look on as Lt. Gen. Shavendra Silva elaborates a point at the meeting where the National Sports Selection Committee was appointed by the new Minister on Friday (2) in Colombo

Can the new sports selection procedure work smoothly? The newly appointed five-member National Sports Selection Committee (NSSC) will have a monumental task. The all-important sports selections in the country, with regard to both the selection panels of the respective sports associations as well as the sports squads and teams, are left for the NSSC which Youth and Sports Minister Namal Rajapaksa appointed on Friday (2). Will it hamper the already existing system of national sports selection? – So asked some of the persons whom  ‘The Morning Sports’  talked to, yesterday.

The new NSSC is headed by Commander of the Army / Chief of Defence Staff / Head of the National Operational Centre for Prevention of Covid-19 / member of the National Sports Council, Lieutenant General Shavendra Silva.

Its other members are President of the National Olympic Committee (NOC) Suresh Subramaniam, General Secretary of the NOC Maxwell de Silva, former Sri Lanka tennis champion and Davis Cup stalwart Arjun Fernando, and former rugby stalwart / former Acting Director of the State Intelligence Service, Deputy Inspector General of Police Hafeez Marso.

 Gazette Extraordinary of 23 September 

The new NSSC has central powers with regard to national sports selection as it was mentioned in the extraordinary gazette No. 2194/54 issued on 23 September.

Such powers include making recommendations in respect of appointing the selection committees of all national sports associations / federations, making recommendations on the particulars about dates, venues, and selection criteria of the selection trials to the athletes, and approving selection criteria of all national sports associations / federations.

The NSSC is vested with the power to conduct inquiries and investigations and to make recommendations with reference to all appeals or complaints received by the national selection committee at the end of the selection trials of all national sports associations.

 Other powers vested with NSSC 

Also, a database on the details of the athletes of all national pools should be prepared, updated, and maintained by the NSSC. In that regard, the above gazette says, the particulars of the talents and bio-data of all athletes in the pools of national sports associations should be referred to the NSSC. Information on the inclusion / removal of athletes after naming the national pools should be provided to the NSSC.

The above gazette also adds that nomination should not be given for any international tournament prior to obtain the approval of the NSSC and an appropriate method should be followed in recommending coaches, managers, trainers, masseur for such international tournaments and the agreement of the NSSC should be obtained thereto.

 Unrealistically long process 

In addition to the above, the Sports Minster has earlier explained that all national sports selection should have final ratification of his National Sports Council (NSC), appointed on 20 August and is headed by Mahela Jayawardene.

Now sports associations / federations will have to send the names of their selection committees much earlier for ministry approval because it has to go through the NSSC and then the NSC. They might have to send in the names before at least a month earlier to get the final ratification. Will that be practical in a sport like cricket and athletics? Within weeks situations changes in sports so that selections will have to adapt to those changes of situations rapidly.

“I don’t think it is practical in cricket. The selectors might have to send the names of the final squad about one month before a series. It won’t be practical,” one of the former cricket selectors who is privy to the ongoing changes told us yesterday.

 Lack of any cricketing rep 

The workload for the NSSC will be too heavy that such busy professionals like the Army Commander will have their work cut out. The item 6 (1) of the 23 September gazette (“A database on the details of the athletes of all national pools should be prepared, updated and maintained by the National Sport Selection Committee”) alone is a complex task which the NSSC will have to do a lot of delegation for.

“The three out of five gentlemen of NSSC are from a tennis background. What we have in Sri Lanka is more a strong cricket and athletic culture. Therefore how they are taking quick decisions on both those key sports will be an interesting prospect. You cannot have reps from all sports there (in NSSC) but someone who knew cricket would have been a must,” another sports veteran said.",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Selection perplexity imminent!,sports,0,1601999323,0,100170,,

,,CAA to note available paddy stocks,news,"By Sarah Hannan 

 The Small and Medium Scale Rice Mill Owners’ Association has raised concerns over large-scale rice mill owners attempting to set larger profit margins in the upcoming inter-cultivation season and has called for streamlining the process of paddy stock purchasing and storing,    The Morning    learnt. 

 Association President B.K. Ranjith, speaking to    The Morning   , said that large-scale rice mill owners are once again getting ready to set a big profit margin during the upcoming inter-cultivation season using their old paddy stocks that they would be milling and releasing as rice to the market. 

 “We do not have the necessary tools or the capacity to stockpile paddy from the previous season’s yields and therefore always use the fresh paddy stocks for milling. That gives the large-scale mill owners an unfair advantage this time around as we will have to purchase paddy stocks at the new price that is stipulated by the Government, whereas they will use old paddy stocks they bought at a cheaper rate and make larger profits,” Ranjith elaborated. 

 Furthermore, the Association had given the information to the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) to conduct a proper investigation to determine the amount of paddy stocks that are available with large-scale rice mill owners. 

 When contacted, CAA Director of Consumer Affairs and Information Asela Bandara said: “We are conducting investigations based on the information supplied by them and taking into consideration the concerns that have been raised by them. Our district CAA officers are now taking stock of the availability of paddy and would then look at taking appropriate action, should we find that the said parties are making large profit margins given the price revisions.” 

 Members of the Association have only one request they have been continuously making to the authorities, which is to streamline the mechanism of paddy purchasing and stocking, and to monitor as to how much of stocks remain with large-scale rice mill owners at the end of one harvesting season in order to determine the price points that are set during the inter-cultivation season milling process.

,,Sanju Samson heroics at IPL - ‘Possible’: the single-word lesson,news,"Sanju Samson during his amazing match-winnning knock for Rajasthan Royal in the 9th match of the current IPL, played against Kings XI Punjab

There is a song released on January 13, 1964. The lyrics obviously were composed before that. Sanju Samson was born 30 year later. And 26 years after that, he played an innings which was akin to offering proof of a prediction embedded in the song.

The song: ‘The times they are a-changing.’ The lyricist and singer: Bob Dylan. The line: ‘the slow one now will later be fast.’

Well, times have changed since 1964 as far as cricket is concerned. No ODIs, no World Cups, no T-20s, no Dilscoops or switch-hits, no third umpires or match referees.

Now we’ve seen amazing performances with bat and ball over the past 56 years. Standout performances. All time ‘greats’ if you will. Amazing turnarounds such as Kusal Janith Perera’s innings-of-a-century 153* against South Africa in the Durban test, January 2019. We have seen one-gem wonders too. Nevertheless, the gems do shine and their luster fades slowly.

And so we have Samson. The 9th match of the current IPL. Kings XI Punjab had amassed 226/6 on the back of a 183 run opening stand between K.L. Rahul (69) and M.A. Agarwal (106). A stiff target for the Rajasthan Royals, but gettable given the short boundaries. They were 100/2 after 9 overs. Skipper Steve Smith had just got out for 50 but Samson was on 43 off 22 balls.

Then came the slump. Between overs 9 and 15, Samson facing 21 of the 36 balls just manages a paltry 15 runs. The required run rate had soared from 11.27/over to 16.80/over!

Samson then carted Glenn Maxwell for 21 runs inclusive of three sixers. Over No 16 turned everything upside down, or it seemed that way, but he’s out the first ball of the next over and it is heartbreaking, obviously, for the Rajasthan Royals. Despite two boundaries by Robin Uthappa in the last two deliveries, the asking rate had climbed back to 17.00/over.

At this time, Rahul Tewatia had scored just 17 off 23. A slow one  a la Bob Dylan.

Over No 18. Tewatia clobbers Sheldon Cottrell for 30 inclusive of five sixers! The ‘slow one’ had gotten ‘fast.’ The asking rate was now a highly manageable 10.53/over. The Rajasthan Royals made it with three balls to spare, Tewatia finishing with 53 off 31.

The ‘how’ of it is of course a question that lends itself to multiple answers. Maybe they were ‘slowly’ getting a measure of the bowlers and the wicket. Maybe they were pinned down by good bowling one over and allowed to vent by wayward stuff in the next. Maybe Samson (and later Tewatia) went mad or, put another way, Maxwell (and later Cottrell) lost their minds.

Whatever it is, this much can be said: Tewatia and Samson put up quite a show. Not one that deserves the tag ‘one for the ages,’ for these kinds of fireworks can be seen at least a couple of times in any IPL tournament.

What’s important, perhaps, is the ‘it is possible’ element in all this. The ‘never give up,’ and, as far as the other side is concerned, ‘never be complacent,’ viz the old adage ‘it’s never over until it is over.’

At some level there has to be self-belief. At some level there has to be something in the team at the receiving end that makes it possible to stem the tide. There are resources that players themselves are unaware they are endowed with. Until they ‘go mad.’

Crazy. Crazy cricket. Crazy sports. Unbelievable. For all the downs of commercialization, the sourness of performance enhancing drugs and match-fixing, we have the occasional Samson and Tewatia. We feel good. As spectators. For aspiring cricketers and indeed aspiring sportsmen and sportswomen, there’s a lesson here.

It’s a single-word lesson. Possible.

 Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Education said that they expect the contribution of the Government of France to enhance vocational education opportunities and training programmes for Sri Lankan students. 

 During a recent meeting held between Minister of Education Prof. G.L. Peiris and Ambassador of France to Sri Lanka Eric Lavertu, the future programmes that could be planned to develop educational relations between Sri Lanka and France as well as to further strengthen co-operation between the two countries, with a special emphasis on the importance of foreign language learning to students, were discussed at length. 

 Ambassador Lavertu commended the contribution made by Prof. Peiris as the Minister of Education in proposing several progressive changes that would be made in the education system of Sri Lanka in the near future. 

 French Embassy Deputy Head of Mission Aurélien Maillet said: “Once the existing Covid-19 situation is brought under control, steps can be taken to provide such opportunities and expand the existing ones in the future.” 

 The possibility of providing undergraduate and postgraduate opportunities to students in Sri Lanka and France as well as plans for the promotion of the French language in university and school education in Sri Lanka were discussed as well. 

 Prof. Peiris further said that the implementation of future educational plans would be facilitated with a wider scope under the four state ministries in charge of the subject.

,,Existing school admission procedures to be revised,news," By Maheesha Mudugamuwa 

 The Government has decided to revise the existing procedure of admission of pupils and introduce a more transparent procedure that enables to increase the number of pupils that could be admitted per classroom. 

 Accordingly, Cabinet approval has been granted to the proposal tabled by Minister of Education Prof G.L. Peiris. The revision has been proposed taking into account the high demand that prevails to admit pupils in this manner. 

 Co-Cabinet Spokesman Minister Keheliya Rambukwella said principals can follow the guidelines in the circulars issued by the Ministry of Education on the admission of pupils to Grade One. 

 Addressing the weekly cabinet media briefing yesterday (6) at the Department of Government Information, Rambukwella said that admitting pupils to Grade Six of national and provincial schools based on cut-off marks of the Grade Five Scholarship examination and admitting pupils to Advanced Level classes based on qualifications of Ordinary Level examinations are conducted by the relevant principals. 

 Additionally, according to the Circulars 37/2008 and 33/2019, pupils enroll in intermediate classes with the agreement of school principals. 

 As per the groups that change the residence due to transfers; arriving from abroad; being elected to Parliament; are judges in service, government specialist doctors, or government medical officers; are employees of the Ministry of Education, schools and allied departments, university lecturers; and executive officers of Sri Lanka Education Administration Service and Sri Lanka Teacher Educators Service are eligible to enroll students to intermediate classes.

           Contact tracing and increasing PCR tests key  
 
 By Maheesha Mudugamuwa 

 Concerns have been raised over the current strain of Covid-19, as doubts have emerged whether the country is hit by a new strain or the same strain of the virus like in the previous situation a few months ago,    The Morning    learnt. 

 According to the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA), the clear picture of the ongoing situation could only be assessed after another 48 hours as the tests and investigations are still ongoing. 

 GMOA Secretary Dr. Senal Fernando told    The Morning    that in the current situation, even asymptomatic persons seem to be spreading the virus more than the earlier situation. 

 “We still don’t know whether we have got a new strain or whether it’s the same strain. Even in other countries, there were discussions that there are different types of Covid-19 strains,” he said, adding that depending on the place from where the virus got into the country, the strain could be different, and sometimes better than the previous situation or worse. 

 “But as of now, the current situation is worse than earlier as it seems that even asymptomatic patients are spreading the virus. The clear situation can be seen after 48 hours,” Dr. Fernando stressed. 

 According to the GMOA, contact tracing, maintaining social distance, and increasing the number of PCR tests should be done immediately to avoid social transmission of the disease. 

 “It’s still too early to say whether there is a social transmission. Also, contact tracing of the infected persons will be difficult, unlike in the previous situation,” he stressed. 

 Meanwhile, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has instructed the relevant parties to take immediate measures to contain the spread of Covid-19, following the identification of close associates of the affected, and to increase the number of PCR tests. 

 Instructions have been issued to carry out random PCR tests in every district in the country as well in institutes. Organisations where a large number of people are employed have been especially asked to conduct tests. However, it does appear that the factories with large work forces have neglected this responsibility.

,,20A Bill Govt. yet to see danger: Wijeyadasa,news," By Maheesha Mudugamuwa 

 Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) MP Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe yesterday (6) said the responsible authorities of the Government had not yet realised the danger of the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution (20A). 

 Addressing the media at his residence in Nawala, Dr. Rajapakshe stressed that they promised the public during the previous election campaign that the provisions which were bad for the country would be removed from the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, for which purpose 20A was to be brought in. 

 Criticising the proposed 20A, the law veteran noted that the presidents who will be elected in the future after incumbent President Gotabaya Rajapaksa would take the maximum benefits of 20A, adding that it would also be a boomerang to President Rajapaksa. 

 “We have identified the loopholes in 19A, but if 19A was not there, President Rajapaksa would never be the president in the country. 19A became a silk route to the President to get into the chair, but now he himself is amending it,” he stressed. 

 Commenting further, Dr. Rajapakshe noted that the executive presidency was essential for the country since the 13th Amendment was introduced and therefore, the executive presidency should be in the Constitution. 

 Meanwhile, Dr. Rajapakshe has also written to President Rajapaksa, raising concerns over 20A and expressing doubts about voting in its favour. 

 The letter, addressed to President Rajapaksa and copied to Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, said that Dr. Rajapakshe was concerned about violating the pledge he has taken as a Member of Parliament to protect the Constitution of Sri Lanka. He had also opined that the Government could have opted to simply remove the negative aspects of 19A and retain its positive points rather than remove it completely. 

 In the letter, Dr. Rajapakshe has called for the power to appoint ministers to be given exclusively to the President, rather than to be done in conjunction with the views of the Prime Minister. He also proposed that instead of the Parliamentary Council, the Constitutional Council be expanded to include the President’s nominee and a nominee from minor parties to expand it to seven members.

,,SL will see worst capitalisation drop in Asia Pacific: Moody’s,business,"Among 14 national banking systems in Asia Pacific (APAC), Sri Lanka will see the worst core capital decline due to the severity of economic shocks to the country, its banks’ weaker starting solvency metrics, and historically weak underwriting, Moody’s Investors Service said in a report released yesterday (6). 

 TCE (tangible common equity) ratios at the majority of rated banks in Sri Lanka will plunge by more than 200 basis points by 2022, while in other economies, except India and Thailand, the proportion of such weak performers will range from 10-30% of rated banks, Moody’s said. In Malaysia, no bank will lose more than 100 basis points of TCE. 

 Core capital, which is measured by TCE as a percentage of risk-weighted assets (RWAs), will decline at 78% of the 218 banks in APAC by the end of 2022 from the end of 2019, Moody’s said. However, declines in capital at most of these banks will not be significant enough to prompt Moody’s to change its views on their fundamental creditworthiness, which also take into account other factors of solvency and liquidity. 

 Indonesia, as a result of its banks' strong profitability, is the only national banking system which is forecast to see capitalisation strengthen in this period. 

 TCE ratios will fall by up to 100 basis points at 31% of banks in the APAC sample and by 100 basis points to 200 basis points at 25%. A further 22% of banks will see drops of more than 200 basis points, moderately higher than 18% in Europe, the US, the UK, Mexico, and Brazil.

,,Eraeliya Villas and Gardens: A work of art,brunch," By Dimithri Wijesinghe 

Situated in Walliwala, Weligama, Eraeliya Villas and Gardens occupies a special little corner in the now-famous tourist spot in the southern coast.

Our stay at the property was certainly a unique one, with its location being unlike anywhere else we’ve visited before; situated at a slightly elevated landing, the property stands almost looming above the seabed while allowing easy access to it, complete with a perfect view of the ocean.

Eraeliya Villas and Gardens is also particularly special in what it offers to its guests as a concept; while most boutique hotels often offer increasingly elaborate amenities, which, frankly, one hardly uses during their one or two-night stay, as one would often use the hotel to simply rest, spend the night, and enjoy a meal, at Eraeliya, your holiday is exclusively “your stay” as the property itself is an experience.

Eraeliya Villas and Gardens Owner Anna Egorkina, a Russian interior designer, expressed her love story with Eraeliya Villas and Gardens, sharing that she came across this most picturesque little bay all the way back in 2008 in Weligama, and after the war ended, she decided to make something of it. Having discovered the location, she said that she wished to do something that justified the beauty of the place.

She shared that back then Weligama was not so popular among tourists. However, unsurprisingly, things have definitely changed since then. “I think the Weligama Beach is the most beautiful beach in Sri Lanka as it is swimmable all year round. We have a beautiful sunset settled around palm trees, and it is the best place for beginner-level surfers to get their start,” she said.

Having run an interior textile company for over two decades with her sister, Anna’s background is in interior design and she shared that back when she studied colonial architecture, she was always most impressed by the different types of it that were scattered around the island, and was thus inspired by those designs. She further added that contemporary tropical architecture courtesy of Geoffrey Bawa also played a huge role in her inspiration for the design of the Eraeliya property.

She said that going into it, what she set out to do was create something that looked like it was always there; to make something equally beautiful to honour and suit the beauty of the place. She said she believes she succeeded as many of her clients ask if the house had always been there and whether they added only the pool.

Eraeliya Villas and Gardens has a total of nine luxurious en suite bedrooms spread over five unique buildings, each inspired by various elements representative of our island, and there are two more to be completed in two months’ time, shared Anna, adding that they hope to conduct a giveaway on their Instagram where they would decide who gets to stay at the new rooms for the first time.

They also offer daily yoga and fitness classes, and they also have their own in-house massage therapist who combines health science and traditional practices from around the world. Anna shared that they favour clean and sustainable living and encourage healthy eating as well, and while they can cater to any palate, they do offer a wide variety of vegan dishes as well.

Speaking about the difficulties they faced during the curfew period, Anna shared that while things were undoubtedly tough, it allowed them to focus on the local market experience and learn from the experiences of the Sri Lankan people who stayed with them. She said that they introduced multiple promotions to encourage visitors, including loyalty programmes where they send special membership cards to their guests and special offers to locals.

Anna also shared that she is constantly looking to collaborate with Sri Lankan artists, stating that they even have an artists’ residency programme, where they invite the artist to stay at the property, at the moment between Monday to Friday, where they provide meals and even materials for the artist, who is encouraged to get inspired and create art. In exchange, Eraeliya Villas and Gardens will keep one piece of their art and the rest is theirs to have. Anna encouraged any local artists to please reach out, as she wishes for her property to be ever changing and would like to include a wide variety of styles of art.",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Eraeliya Villas and Gardens: A work of art,brunch,0,1602021342,0,100220,,

 The Ministry of Education yesterday (7) announced that the 2020 Advanced Level (A/L) examination and the 2020 Grade Five Scholarship examination will be held on the previously communicated dates, despite the recent outbreak of Covid-19 reported following the detection of the Minuwangoda cluster. 

 Accordingly, the Grade Five Scholarship examination will be held on Sunday, 11 October, while the G.C.E. A/L examination will be held between Monday, 12 October and Friday, 6 November islandwide. 

 A total of 132,000 students have registered to sit for this year’s Grade Five Scholarship examination, while 162,000 students have registered to sit for the G.C.E. A/L examination. 

 Given the dynamic situation due to the nature of the virus, Minister of Education Prof. G.L. Peiris noted: “We are closely working with the health authorities and the tri-forces to ensure that the ideal environment is created for the children to sit for the exams in the coming weeks. The necessary protocols will be followed accordingly to hold the examinations for the two grades.” 

 Meanwhile, National Operation Centre for Prevention of Covid-19 Outbreak Head and Army Commander Lt. Gen. Shavendra Silva urged that parents should ensure the child follows all the necessary health precautions at the time of leaving the house en route to the examination hall and when entering the examination hall. 

 “Make sure they are given a surgical mask or a reusable mask they could comfortably wear, and remind them the health habits they need to adhere to. Once they come to the examination centre, our officers along with school and health authorities will ensure their safety,” he said. 

 Secretary to the Ministry of Education Prof. Kapila Perera assured that the Minister, along with the four State Ministers and Department of Education heads, has decided not to postpone the examinations any further.

,,MT New Diamond enters Maldivian territorial waters,news,"By Sarah Hannan 

 The Sri Lanka Navy Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre safely transferred the MT New Diamond oil tanker into Maldivian territorial waters on Tuesday evening (6),    The Morning    learnt. 

 “The MT New Diamond crude oil tanker tow operation was successfully carried out; it was transferred into Maldivian territorial waters and the towing operation monitoring process was handed over to the Indian Coast Guard,” the Sri Lanka Navy revealed. 

 It’s been just over a month since the crude oil tanker sounded a distress call on 3 September when one of the boilers in the ship’s engine room exploded and caught on fire, endangering the crew and causing considerable marine pollution off the eastern coast of Sri Lanka just 38 nautical miles away from Sangamankanda Point. 

 The Sri Lanka Air Force, Sri Lanka Navy, Sri Lanka Ports Authority, Indian Navy, and Indian Coast Guard responded promptly to the distress call and assisted in dousing the fire on two occasions. 

 Although Sri Lanka’s litigation process followed after a few hiccups, the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) stepped in to take the necessary legal action against the ship’s Captain and the owners of the ship in order to claim the rescue and fire mitigation operation costs that Sri Lanka incurred. 

 It was only after the ship’s owner paid the rescue and fire mitigation claim of Rs. 442 million that the ship’s towing process was allowed to commence. 

 As stated by the MEPA, separate legal action will be taken for pollution caused due to the bunker oil spill which is showing a visible impact to the marine ecosystem. 

 On 28 September, National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) oceanographers observed that the turtle habitat in the eastern seas was impacted in the region where the bunker oil spill had taken place. 

 At the request of Attorney General (AG) Dappula de Livera, following an observation made by Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris on 17 September, the Captain was taken into custody on charges of abandoning the ship when the fire broke out while it was transporting crude oil from Kuwait to India, adding that their irresponsible actions resulted in a disastrous situation. 

 The Additional Magistrate then issued summons noting that the Captain of MT New Diamond, who was named as a suspect, had failed to co-operate with the ongoing investigations.  

 The MEPA, with the assistance of the NARA, launched further observations and studies into the bunker oil spill that was caused by the MT New Diamond. 

 The sea route the crude oil tanker was originally set to take was from Kuwait’s Port Mina Al Ahmadi on 23 August to reach India’s Port Paradip on 5 September. 

 However, following the accident, the owners decided to tow the ship back to the port of origin. ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,MT New Diamond enters Maldivian territorial waters,news,0,1602106844,0,100316,,

 The Government has taken steps to amend the Workmen's Compensation Ordinance No. 19 of 1934. Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved the proposed amendments to the draft bill to amend the Workmen’s Compensation Ordinance No. 19 of 1934 and thereby, to take measures to escalate the amount of compensation eligible to be paid to the employees during an accident.  

 Minister of Mass Media Keheliya Rambukwella said the Legal Draftsman has drafted a bill to amend the applicable provisions of the Workmen’s Compensation Ordinance to increase the amount of compensation paid to the employees who encounter accidents and experience damages.  

 It has been observed that the said bill should be further amended due to reasons including the increment of the fine of Rs. 1,000 that can be imposed in terms of the provisions prevailing to the date of the instance in which an employer does not furnish a compensation statement to the Commissioner of Compensation with regard to a particular accident caused to an employee as per Section 42 of the Workmen’s Compensation Ordinance.  

 The reasons also include the amendment of Schedule 4 of the Workmen’s Compensation Ordinance which emphasises the compensation amount to suit the current circumstances, assigning the compensation recovery process of confiscating the property to the fiscal/registrar attached to the office of the Commissioner of Compensation, in order to accelerate the compensation process and introduce a new labour compensation insurance scheme.

We have identified that the primary female party is the owner of a hostel, while the two members occupying her hostel and the supervisor being referred to are employed by a third-party cleaning service provider contracted by the Brandix Minuwangoda facility. We confirm that none of these individuals are employees of Brandix. 

 As an organisation, we rally together to care for the affected employees and their families, whilst endeavouring to minimise the impact on our communities and our nation in a collective effort to emerge from this crisis.

,,The challenges teachers are facing during this pandemic ,brunch," By Dimithri Wijesinghe 

 5 October was International Teachers’ Day. However, considering the state of the world, being preoccupied with curbing the spread of the pandemic, the celebration of the services rendered by some of society’s most invaluable contributors was lackluster at best. Especially in Sri Lanka, with the discovery of a new Covid-19 cluster and the subsequent panic, the much-deserved recognition and celebration of our teachers who have continued to give their best, was pushed aside.  

 This year’s theme for the international day is “Teachers: Leading in crisis, reimagining the future”, highlighting the work done by educators when both schools and higher education institutes were closed due to the coronavirus pandemic. 

 Considering the role of teachers in building resilience and shaping the future of education, we see that they have an imperative role to play. In this crisis, teachers have shown great leadership and innovation in ensuring that no learner is left behind, by finding solutions and creating new learning environments for their students to allow education to continue and embracing this time as an opportunity to reimagine education and the importance of providing equal access to quality learning for every student.  

 In recognising the roles that teachers have had in helping to ensure that a generation of students can reach their full potential by taking online classes despite not being familiar with the new technologies, they’ve ensured that the pandemic doesn’t put a pause on the education of their pupils. 

 We reached out to a number of teachers who shared their experience on engaging in distance teaching and how they see the next few months panning out for their students, especially their exam-focused students, who had to not only prepare to face a defining moment in their life in terms of their school careers, but also process the unknown and constant uncertainty that has come with a global pandemic.  

  Great pressure on the teachers  

 Chamila Wasanthi Gamage, Principal at Lanka Sabha Junior School, Battaramulla  

 The truth of the matter is that for the younger children and really the majority of the children in schools, Covid feels like an adult problem, and for the past few months, while many children have grasped the importance of wearing protective gear, they tend to have short attention spans and most children wish to be free without any restriction. Especially when they are made to do something, they often opt not to follow through and so we have been dealing with situations where children have been lax in wearing protective face masks and taking other precautions.  

 Now, with this most recent situation, as it is on “top-of-mind recall” and all the adults around them would stress, they would wear it (protective gear), but once again, if the heat soon runs out and people begin to take it easy once again, children too will act in accordance. Students are very attune to their surroundings and they feel the nature of the environment around them.  

 Therefore, if this starts to happen, it creates a great pressure on us as teachers. In addition to making sure they remain safe, we too must maintain our safety and by extension, our families. As such, it is really important that awareness is created and that it remains a current topic of discussion.  

 As for examinations and such, we have adopted an approach where we do not worry about covering the syllabus. What we have decided on now is to have exam-focused learning for the students. We carry out lessons that involve past papers and revision, which means that instead of teaching a whole lesson inclusive of understanding a topic in a broader sense, we make use of learning that is exam based and focused on certain popular areas that are questioned, which to be honest, has been effective. 

  The students just wish to get it over with  

 Augusta Anthonymuththu, teacher at St. Bridget’s Convent, Colombo 7  

 If you consider the online sessions conducted initially, it was a challenge, because we had never done it before and we were asked not to switch on the video as it was distracting; that was even more of a barrier, because it created an impersonal layer. 

 I teach Grades 9, 10, and 11, students preparing for Ordinary Levels, and while we had no choice but to carry out online classes, when we got back to school, many students shared with us that they were not listening to some of the lessons, and they asked me to repeat certain lessons. While I was very happy that they came and requested the repetition of lessons, there were difficulties like that.  

 As for the older students, the ones facing their Advanced Levels especially, they have become exceedingly de-motivated by these constant extensions. You would think that they would be happy about the more time they get to study, but their mentality is different. They are finding it difficult to stay engaged for so long and at this point, they just wish to get it over with.  

 As for covering syllabuses and things like that, we truly made use of the online lessons. We were able to cover the lessons and when they came back to school in August, we started with revision straight away.  

 Sri Lanka is nowhere near being able to (move to an online grading system) effectively. Many of the senior teachers faced a lot of difficulty when it came to handling online tools and if we were to move to an online grading system and online test-taking, then we would have to really streamline and carry out workshops and establish an infrastructure where the teachers are well trained to modulate such activities. 

  The very fabric of the right to free education is tested  

 Gulzar Ahmed, teacher and coach 

 Ever since 12 March, teaching in Sri Lanka took an unexpected and much-needed turn, at a pace one would have never expected. The much-criticised internet was the lifeline of the education sector in Sri Lanka. Despite the sudden embrace, it was not an easy pill to swallow for the mass majority of the stakeholders in the field. As a teacher, teaching via Zoom or any other platforms our schools adopted wasn’t as simple as walking into a classroom and teaching a class full of students in person.  

 The greatest difficulty was that teachers weren’t familiar with the online mode of teaching and hence, it was a learning curve for teachers. Students islandwide don’t have stable internet connections and, in some cases, even the teacher doesn’t and as such, it acted as a hindrance to us and the student.  

 Also, when eight million people in this country barely make Rs. 1,000 per day, you can’t expect their children to be able to attend a virtual class on a daily basis. Virtual learning might look feasible in Colombo and some other districts, but how about the kids in districts like Monaragala or Kilinochchi? The very fabric of the right to free education is tested. 

 Therefore, as teachers, we can do nothing but hope for this pandemic to pass and prepare ourselves in the coming years to adapt to new modes of teaching and train our students to adapt to new modes of learning, for we have to embrace technology which is an integral part of life on this planet. 

  Parents have an imperative role to play in their children’s lives  

 Rizka Ismath, teacher at Zahira College Colombo  

 When the pandemic was at its height, almost overnight, we as teachers had to suddenly figure out alternative ways to teach our students. While taking into consideration the varying degrees of access to the internet that our students had, some of them found it very difficult to find a decent internet connection.  

 We used WhatsApp to share most lessons and had a weekly Zoom session, which would be utilised to discuss what was shared via WhatsApp. We had to use WhatsApp because that is what most people had access to most widely, and Zoom was very rarely accessed. About 50% of the students had access to it; not just an internet connection, but also devices. Some had to either share with siblings or they straight up did not have them.  

 As for the perspective from a teacher, I would say that personally, I did enjoy it to an extent. It was certainly a learning experience. We were made to attempt something we otherwise would never have tried to learn. I learnt a lot; we learnt how to search online and utilise online teaching and learning materials that were readily available.  

 However, when we went back to school, what we found was that despite all of the online lessons, students hadn’t gasped all that much by way of those lessons, with many of them needing to brush up on all those lessons before we moved forward. Perhaps since it was a new experience this was so, but from what we have seen, distance learning was not very effective.  

 As for examinations and online tests, I do not believe that Sri Lanka is ready for such a thing yet, as there are a few resources.  Finally, for us to move forward and if the most recent incidents indicate an extended period of living with the pandemic, bringing the promise of a much longer time living in this uncertainty, I think that parents have an imperative role to play in their children’s lives. With children spending their learning time at home, parents must take charge and familiarise themselves with these online learning tools too, so that they can better support their children. 

  Education is no longer a ‘filling of the cup’ but is rather a ‘lighting of a spark’  

 Asanka S. Perera, Sub-Warden at S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia  

 Moving our entire education system to an online platform was something no one predicted, but due to the new experience that came with it, there was much interest shown by parents, teachers, and students alike. For the teachers, it was a very useful tool as we were able to continue the lessons without the lockdown being a hindrance. For the students, it was a very useful tool to meet their friends again from various parts of the country, and provided them the ability to learn at their own pace and not be restricted to a classroom lesson, which may at times speed past them due to the lack of time.  

 We were able to continue their education, and in a big way, we were able to continue keeping them physically active during the lockdown, with all our sports activities being done online and having regular PE (physical education) sessions for all the students of the school. Headed by our Sports Department, this was done while keeping in mind the ""Healthy Mind in a Healthy Body"" concept.  

 However, the sad reality is that the facility was not something easily accessible to all. We had students who were not able to come online due to the lack of data or even a device for the same. With the help of the Old Boys’ Association and friends of the school, we were able to provide the necessary devices and data for as many as possible as per their need, very successfully.  

 As time went, and as parents resumed their work life, we found that the interest of the students started to drop ever so slightly, due to the lack of monitoring at home, through no fault of the parents. This was a challenge, but the teachers did what they could in order to maintain their interest. Although the tool is useful, if there is no supervision at home, the exercise is found to be less fruitful. This creates a need for responsible independence, which may not always be forthcoming.   

 The future functioning of the country may look bleak at present. However, having established a working ""online"" platform, we will simply switch to the same to carry on teaching – learning we would have otherwise missed. The onus lies with the student, and for the younger students, with the parents. Education, especially through online means, is no longer a ""filling of the cup"" but is rather a ""lighting of a spark"" as the present Warden always says. Resources are many, and the teacher needs to only facilitate the students in accessing the resources responsibly, as required, in order to further their knowledge and learning.

,,Sri Guitar Jam – Volume I: OM (Emanate),brunch," By Dimithri Wijesinghe 

 An idea brought to life courtesy of Stigmata Co-Founder and guitarist Tennyson Napoleon during lockdown, as a means to unite guitarists and bassists of all genres and styles to “partake and collaborate on an epic musical journey unlike anything heard or seen before”, the Sri Guitar Jam is a diverse project that is quintessentially unique and absolutely one of a kind. 

 Uniting the foremost Sri Lankan guitarists from around the world as a collective, Sri Guitar Jam, released on 27 September 2020 at 5 p.m. via Island Pulse, was borne of   Tenny’s wish to spread a positive message and breathe new life into the musicians of Lanka who have faced great difficulty during the pandemic. 
He shared that while during the lockdown there were various collaborations and jam sessions happening for vocalists and singers, there wasn’t a lot happening with regard to instrumentals in Sri Lanka and therefore he developed this idea of collaborating with a number of guitarists he knew personally. As he reached out to more and more people, the project grew from five artists to 10 to the 50-plus mammoth collaboration it is at today. 

 Sri Guitar Jam is special for a myriad of reasons, with one being that it is bringing together guitarists of Sri Lankan origin from around the world, comprising a star-studded lineup of musicians from Australia, Norway, Bahrain, and South Africa. 

 “...Veterans and household sensations intertwined with new blood and young rising talent, all of Lankan origin from around the globe,” he said, adding that their youngest collaborator is 17 years old while the oldest is around 72, which really adds to the diversity of the project. 

 Tenny spoke of how he went about putting together the collaboration, sharing the musicians were given just one brief – to tell their story, their experience through these difficult times – and beyond a few technical guidelines (tempo and key), they were allowed complete creative freedom. He shared that by allowing this open-ended brief, they saw what can really be created when you give people the platform. Even those who would not have otherwise composed originals were finally given the opportunity to take a few minutes and create, which produced some beautiful results, he added. 

 Having collected the influx of creative works flowing his way, Tenny shared that he chose to compile the works into four categories and create a cohesive story: The first chapter is titled “Lemuria”, inspired by a long-lost continent fabled to have been an advanced civilization   also known as “Kumari Kandam”, which is believed to have been located South of India in present day Sri Lanka. The first chapter is broken down into four   expansive and elaborate volumes: 

 Volume I – OM: Emanate 

 Volume II – Lemuria: The Cradle of Civilization 

 Volume III – Kumari Kandam: The Aftermath 

 Volume IV – Rebirth: Utopia 

“It is the first time something of such scope and magnitude has been conceptualised and brought to life. Each music piece is original and a marvel of its own. It is a masterpiece of each and every creator who has joined the Sri Guitar Jam and is a part of it. The way it has grown and the sheer scope of it is truly overwhelming. I am blessed to have so many talented musicians to work with me to make this project a reality. This is truly for the love of guitar-based music, but also to unite people through the power of music in these hard times to overcome and endure the pandemic and global crisis that has affected everyone from all walks of life,” Tenny said. 

The 50-plus lineup   features guitarists and bassists from multiple genres and musical styles, including Allan, Amaranath, Amesh, Angelo, Anton, Ashen, Ashane, Avon, Chanaka, Derek, Delaine, Dennis, Dihan, Duleep, Dylan, Gayan, Gihan, Hiruni, Izzy, Jaaga, Kamal, Kavin, Khazim, Sarani and Uvindu, Lakshika, Madara, Mikhail, Mirshad,   Misha, Nathan, Neuvi, Nisha, Prabudda, Prasad, Praveen, Primal, Rakitha, Ravin, Revon, Rewan, Riyal, Rohan and Rohitha, Sangeeth, Savindu, Shalinda, Shanaka, Shane, Sharman, Shashika, Shobi, Tenny, Tilak, and Thisara. 

The four volumes of “Chapter One: Lemuria”   will be released free online as a Single and video across digital formats so that each featured guitarist could push and promote themselves and improve their livelihoods in this difficult time. 

 Tenny also stressed the importance of their partners, without whom Sri Guitar Jam would not have been possible, including official strategic partner Sandbox; official online media partner Island Pulse and Pulse; promotions and online partner Decibel.lk; podcast partner ChannaChannaChanna; promotions partners Sh3hara Sri Lankan Music, SL Bruh, Third Ear Productions, and SL Metal Freak; music video partner Evil Cat Lab; venue partner WildchildLabz; and content writer Wordsmith.

,,Use US GSP better: Ambassador Teplitz,business," Ambassador of the US to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Alaina B. Teplitz

 Ambassador of the US to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Alaina B. Teplitz has called on Sri Lanka to utilise more fully the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) offered by the US Government. 

 “Trade can still grow and one way Sri Lankan companies can maximise trade with the US is to take better advantage of existing trade preferences. For example, did you know that exports under the Generalised System of Preferences or GSP accounted for 5.32% of the total exports to the US in 2019? That seems like a very small percentage. A total of $ 196 million in exports were eligible for cost savings under GSP,” she said. 

 Teplitz was addressing the 4th Annual General Meeting of Sri Lanka – USA Business Council (SLUSABC), which functions under the aegis of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, as the Chief Guest on 17 September. 

 She also encouraged local businesses to market these benefits to attract more buyers. 

Seated from left: Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Manager Business Council Dinithi Dias; SLUSABC Vice President Sanji De Silva; Ambassador of the US to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Alaina B. Teplitz; SLUSABC President Dr. Asanka Ratnayake; SLUSABC Treasurer Mohan Mendis; and SLUSABC Immediate Past President Samantha Rajapaksha.

Ltd.; Sanjaya Samararatne of Global Rubber Industries (Pvt.) Ltd.; Shane Perera of Regency Teas (Pvt.) Ltd.; Indika Kulathunga of Dipped Products PLC; and Farhath Armith of Fanam International (Pvt.) Ltd.

 “This is a marketing advantage that Sri Lankan firms should be broadcasting to prospective buyers as a reason to buy from these companies.  It’s an advantage that, in fact, we do not want to be kept a secret.  We want Sri Lankan businesses to know about these opportunities, which is why the embassy facilitated discussions as recently as last week explaining how GSP exporters can take better advantage of GSP benefits and we’ll continue to discuss that topic if there is further interest.” 

 Hayleys Advantis Ltd. Director Dr. Asanka Ratnayake was re-elected as the President of the SLUSABC for 2020/2021 at the AGM, and in his address he said that Sri Lanka should capitalise on its geopolitical positioning to reap long-term economic benefits. 

 “The pandemic gives us reasons to be optimistic. In recent years, Sri Lanka has been increasingly featured in discussions on the Asian geopolitical environment. Undoubtedly our strategic location across the Indian Ocean sea lanes has been attracting the interest of major powers such as India, China, and more recently, Japan and the US. Whilst this has its own merits and demerits, I hope Sri Lanka will be able to withstand, to play a new role on Asia’s rapidly changing geopolitical stage and convert it to the country’s own long-term economic benefit,” Dr. Ratnayake said. 

 Sanji De Silva of Bileeta (Pvt.) Ltd. was elected as the Vice President and Mohan Mendis of Heritage Teas (Pvt.) Ltd. was elected as the Treasurer for the period 2020/2021. CBL Natural Foods (Pvt.)

,,Fate of LPL to be known this week,sports," The start of the LPL was postponed on many occasions. Its 23 November start is now in severe doubt with the ongoing spike of Covid-19 cases in the country 
 There is a sudden, unexpected spike in the Covid-19 cases in Sri Lanka following the emergence of the ‘Brandix’ apparel factory cluster in Minuwangoda, a town in Gampaha District, 35 km north east of Colombo. As a result, the sports activities that were slowly picking up in the country have been hit by a severe blow. The Lanka Premier League (LPL), the only major cricket tournament in the country following the outbreak of the coronavirus in March, will be the most significant of them all. 
 It was only last month (20 September) that Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) announced that the LPL will be held from 21 November to 13 December. 
 “We are going to assess the situation within the next couple of days. Then only we will have to decide whether we can move forward or not. But for the moment, we have scheduled to start it on the 21st (of November) as we have announced recently,” said SLC CEO Ashley de Silva yesterday (7). 
 On 20 September, SLC pushed back the LPL’s start from 14 to 21 November (by one week) to allow longer passage for the players who are now taking part in the Indian Premier League (IPL) in the United Arab Emirates to come to Sri Lanka to participate in the LPL. 
 The LPL is scheduled to be held at Kandy, Dambulla, and Hambantota. The five-team tournament will consist of 23 matches. ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Fate of LPL to be known this week,sports,0,1602174937,0,100410,,
,,Want to reach your goals? Then begin developing systems today!,tabloids," By Sakuni Weerasinghe 

 Most of us approach life by devising unsystematic goals – read the entire AP Psychology text over the weekend, lose 10 kg, get rich by 30. This reflects the mindset that is the result of what has been drilled into us from the moment we begin to read, write, and converse. It was long believed that goal setting is a means to success and happiness in life; happiness is believed to be the result of achieving those goals. This explains the rat race, doesn’t it? And how people take pride in productivity at the expense of their psychosocial health? This competitiveness begins in school, with children being pitted against each other to achieve the best score. 

 The way we keep score of our successes and failures and berate ourselves for lagging behind, in the midst of it all, results in a moment of horror as you look in the mirror and fail to recognise yourself – the sadness, weariness, and fatigue hanging on you like a robe of misery. Why does reaching goals have to look like this? News flash – it doesn’t. Not if you build effective systems to reach your goals. 

 Goals are indeed necessary. It is what propels us forward in life and gives us something to look forward to. It is fairly easy to identify as it often reflects our desires and needs. After all, we almost always know what we want. It’s just a matter of getting there. Yet, the truth remains that identifying and setting a goal, and having it written down neatly at the top of a blank sheet of paper is not the way to achieve it. 

 The task at hand is rather simple however. We must set in place a system that helps us achieve our goals. The system I’m referring to here is what James Clear, in his book    Atomic Habits   , refers to as habit formation. Thus, looking beyond goal setting, we must look into developing effective systems of habits as a means of achieving our goals. 

 But why must we go beyond goal setting? 

 As Clear explains, achieving a goal can bring about a momentary change in your life. Once you hit the 10 kg weight loss or finish reading the textbook, there pops a question of “what next?” Unless you have habits in place to continue to work on your improvements, you will be stuck in the same cycle of unhealthy eating or cramming the night before your exam. 

 You may also be led to falsely believe that you will be happy only once you reach your goal. In a sense, this implies that happiness is something to be reached at the end rather than during the process. For one, this interferes with your day-to-day wellbeing as you tolerate distress and discomfort and make sacrifices at the expense of your health, and secondly, this can make you question if the goal is really worth it, increasing your chances of abandoning the goal altogether. 

 Furthermore, you may even label yourself as a success or failure depending on whether you achieved your goals, and often in relation to the time you took to reach them. Hence, the only means of bringing about lasting change is to look beyond goal setting and focus on setting up systems. 

 Let’s take a look at how we can establish habit systems. 

 

 Step one: Take a look at your existing habits 

 

 A good place to start is by taking a look at your existing habits. For one, it builds more awareness of how we have been living thus far and allows us to see where the changes are necessary. It is important, however, that we remain compassionate towards ourselves and adopt a non-judgmental approach when going through our list. After all, there may be many habits that we engage in throughout the day that leave us scratching our heads in embarrassment. 

 

 Step two: Establish micro habits 

 

 Our natural tendency is to want to leap forward. However, try to take small steps instead. After all, it is the little things you do each day that form an aggregate that gets you closer to your goals. These are small changes that you would be able to incorporate into your life with relative ease. Clear proposes that we engage in habit stacking. 

 That is to say that we can engage in a new behaviour by tying it to something we do every day anyway. Suppose your goal is to clean your room on Sundays. At the start of the week, you build a habit of making your bed after having your morning cup of tea. Making your bed could be the smallest step you take in cleaning your room, yet doing this every day for the week can have a lasting impact. Take little steps like this and you would have already met your goal by Sunday without much exhaustion. Besides, you would then have the day to spend with your family or to relax. 

 

 Step three: Replace old, ineffective habits with habits that align with your identity 

 

 Any action that is not congruent with your identity will not last. You would either have to change your habits and goals, or you would have to change your identity. Question your intentions behind any goal, and then you can determine what habits need to be in place to help you get there. If your intention behind exercising to lose 10 kg is to become healthier, then you may need to adopt other habits besides exercise, such as looking into your dietary practices, seeking professional help from a nutritionist and fitness instructor, and going to a general practitioner for check-ups. This ensures that you remain health conscious even after reaching your goal of “losing 10 kg”. 

 Evaluate your self-talk as well. It wouldn’t help your cause to continuously refer to yourself as a “junk food lover”. Your actions will most likely be synonymous with the labels you’re assigning to yourself. It helps to constantly review your habits by asking yourself: “Does this behaviour help me become the type of person I want to be?"" 

 

 Step four: Create a reward system 

 

 Rewarding yourself after displaying desirable behaviour reinforces that behaviour. A lot of the time we give ourselves rewards upon meeting our final goals based on this principle. It is also equally important to give yourself rewards throughout the process. This could be anything from a pat on the back for completing your homework assignments in the evening, a compliment to yourself in having established a habit of making your bed every day, or a healthy snack after a 30-minute exercise routine. The surefire way to wreck yourself in the process of reaching your goals is to expect to feel happiness only upon reaching your goal. If you can ensure that the goals and the systems you have put in place align with who you are, then the process of engaging in your habit systems to get you to your goals will bring you as much joy as reaching it. Thus, engaging in habits themselves can be a rewarding experience.

,,This is Local Suddha (aka Rafael Wijesekera),tabloids," By Mahika Panditha  

 Happy Sunday y’all! This man needs no introduction but I do want to give you a little bit of information about him before we dive right into the conversation. You may know him as Local Suddha on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. His name is Rafael Wijesekera, and he is a computer software engineer with a passion for game development. 

 He is not actually Sri Lankan, no matter how much he may seem like it, but we’ll get into that later, haha! So, I suggest you guys check out the conversation we were lucky to have with the Local Suddha himself!  

   

 Tell us a little about yourself. 

 I’m Rafael Wijesekera. I was born in Russia but I grew up in Sri Lanka. You may have come across some videos where you saw my parents and wondered how they are Sri Lankan – that’s because they are my step parents. Yes, I have two Sri Lankan step parents and that’s kind of the reason why I’m here. 

 I work two jobs at the moment, one related to computer software engineering and the other, which I really enjoy, is game development at Motion Miracles. Many people wonder how I know Sinhala; I learnt it during my time at boarding school here in Sri Lanka. I went to S. Thomas’ College for about three years. During my time there, I had to learn the language as even though I was studying in English medium, half of the subjects were in Sinhala. Even though I can speak/understand Sinhala, I still struggle to read and write, which means I was failing all my Sinhala subjects during my time there.  

 How did you get into comedy?  

 I always enjoyed comedy and I loved doing small skits and such whenever I was free. In school I remember some friends and I used to make some really cool, funny short videos using Dubsmash (an app like TikTok which was famous during that time). Sadly, we didn’t properly save the videos so we have no idea where they are. From there on, I realised I’ve always liked to make people laugh, even if the jokes are bad. Seeing people laugh and enjoy whatever dumb joke I might make brings me joy. 

 What motivated you to start posting on various platforms and how has that experience been?  

 So during quarantine, my friend was pushing me to download TikTok and post some content on it. I was quite hesitant but ended up doing it because it’s also a good way to grow my YouTube channel. So I decided to do something different for once and use my Sinhala knowledge to post a funny video. After posting it on TikTok and Instagram, it basically blew up, and at that point I knew this was something I should definitely continue doing. And so whenever I’m free, I work on funny videos as a hobby. 

 Which platform would you say has the best engagement and why?  

 TikTok, I think, has the best engagement, but it’s very unpredictable. One moment a video of yours can do very well and at other times it won’t do as well as you hoped it would. As for Instagram and YouTube, these tend to be more consistent. But overall, the best potential is in YouTube in my opinion. Even though my YouTube channel doesn’t have as much followers as my TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook pages, I’m looking forward to trying to grow on that platform more than the others. 

 What advice do you have for budding comedians and content creators?  

 Just be yourself and go for it. The biggest mistake you can make is never starting. Plus, put yourself out there more, don’t let your shyness hold you back, and don’t worry about what other people would think. Especially for comedians, to be funny, you need to be a bit silly, so don’t be shy to be silly and look stupid. 

 What’s the biggest lesson you learnt in your career so far?  

 Honestly, I would say staying humble. I never would’ve been able to get to where I am without the help of all the amazing people who decided to check out my videos and follow me for more. Some people tend to lose track of how they got to where they are and don’t really acknowledge the fact that those people they may look down on are the reason they are even up there in the first place. 

 Where do you hope you and your platform will be in the next five years? 

 I am looking forward to trying to grow mainly on YouTube so I hope I’ll have a good following in five years. At the moment, the content I work on is catered to a Sri Lankan audience, but I am also open to making more content for international audiences. And that is also my plan once I start living with some friends; we plan on starting up our own YouTube channel and putting up the crazy stuff we do.

,,Simple and easy methods to keep your anger and stress in check,tabloids," 

 By Patrick de Kretser 

 Anger issues are a natural problem a lot of people face. Many face it without realising just how much their aggression affects their daily lives. It is important for you to identify whether or not you may be suffering from anger issues. If you feel like you are constantly overwhelmed with emotions or work, or that you have trouble organising yourself and your thoughts, or if you’re easily irritated by things that others do, you might be suffering from anger issues. And if you are, the first thing you need to remember is that this is a completely normal issue to face. 

 Many people don’t seek help because they cannot understand why they get overwhelmed with all these emotions and they do not know where to look for help or who to talk to. I would personally like to point out that you should first and foremost see a doctor for a diagnosis if you feel like this applies to you, but I can understand if you are hesitant. Therefore, I would like to present an alternative – simple home remedies and reminders that you can use to try and keep yourself in check. These will vary in effectiveness depending on the person, but the idea is to actively practise a few methods every day in order to reduce the amount of stress you experience which contributes directly to your anger. 

 

 Express your anger in a nonconfrontational way 

 When you get frustrated over something, whether it is over studies, work, your friends, or otherwise, it is important to take a few minutes to calm yourself down and collect your thoughts. The idea is to bite your tongue and not speak impulsively immediately after you get frustrated, so that you can calm yourself down as much as possible before speaking. Once you do, express your anger verbally in a manner which is assertive but also nonconfrontational. That way, you can get your frustrations out of your system and also help others understand where you are coming from. 

 Exercise 

 Channelling your frustrations through routine exercise is a popular remedy for stress and anger, especially for those who have problems finding out what they should direct their emotions towards. Those of you who have watched “Mean Girls” would remember that there is a rather popular scene in the end where Regina George directs her anger and frustration towards field hockey, which rather effectively helped her mental wellbeing. The same concept applies here. 

 Practise breathing exercises and relaxation techniques 

 Many people who have gotten into yoga would recommend this as an important step for anger management. Emotional stress takes a great toll on us and we often forget to prioritise our own self-care because of this. Learning relaxation techniques and practising deep breathing exercises is an important routine that makes you put yourself first, which is something you need to do to control your emotions and collect your thoughts. 

 Aromatherapy 

 This is a tip I picked up rather recently from a friend who suggested it for controlling anxiety, which I can imagine also works rather well with anger and stress-related issues. Scented candles create a fragrant atmosphere that will calm you down when you are doing tasks, greatly reducing your stress levels and your likelihood to break out in frustration over something. Spa Ceylon is a popular place to get these candles and they are available in multiple aromas depending on what you prefer. 

 When in doubt, laugh it out 

 Humour is another interesting avenue that you can venture down if you want to control your anger. The idea is to make light of a bad situation and find ways to look back on your misfortunes and laugh about it in a positive way. Aim to give yourself a reason to stay positive and lively so that you do not focus on your aggression as much. Picking up a comedy series to watch on TV is also a good way to keep your anger in check. As they say, laughter is the best medicine. 

 Know when to seek help 

 Ultimately, you have to make sure you know when to turn to someone for help if you cannot control your emotions any longer. It does not necessarily have to be a doctor; you can always confide in someone you trust so that you have the emotional support you need. 

 

 If the above tips do not appear useful to you and you feel like you might pose an immediate threat to either yourself or others, seek help as soon as possible. And like I said before, there is nothing wrong with seeking help if you need it.

             Special bus and train service to be arranged  
 
 By Sarah Hannan 

 The state-owned public transport institutions, Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) and Sri Lanka Railways (SLR), said that they are ready to arrange special bus and train services to facilitate student and teacher travel for examinations starting on Sunday (11). 

 The Ministry of Education on Wednesday (7) said that special transportation facilities will be made available for the transportation of students sitting for the Grade Five Scholarship and G.C.E. Advanced Level (A/L) examinations this month along with the teachers who are going for exam duties. 

 Given that the entirety of the Gampaha District and a section of the Colombo District are currently under police curfew and cordoned off as isolated areas to prevent the spread of Covid-19, the Ministry of Education said it will arrange transport facilities for students to get to their examination centres on time and to go safely back to their homes after the examinations. 

  The Morning    contacted SLTB Deputy General Manager H.A. Pandula to inquire as to how they plan to arrange bus services under the given guidelines. 

 “We are yet to receive an official request from the Ministry of Education and as to what procedures we will have to follow when we are providing transport for children and teachers in the areas that are now isolated. More than that, we will have to call in our staff members from the respective areas to work to operate the buses.” 

 Pandula added that the SLTB is prepared to provide the necessary buses to transport the students. However, they will have to follow a strict time schedule to ensure the bus service does not get misused by any others. 

 “We will have to give them a time as to when the bus leaves from their hometown in the morning and then at what time it would leave the school premises/the town the school is located at back to their homes,” Pandula elaborated. 

 Meanwhile, SLR General Manager M.J.D. Fernando, speaking to    The Morning   , said that a special train service will operate within the Gampaha District for the purpose of transporting students and teachers commuting for exams. 

 “We are yet to decide the train departure and arrival times and will be able to publish the same latest by Saturday (10). Our staff at the station and the trains will be given all the necessary guidelines they should follow when students and teachers use our train service during this time.” 

 Both institutions noted that they will follow the instructions given to them by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health when transporting the students and teachers for examinations from Sunday onwards.

,,Consumer Affairs Authority confiscates 150 MTs of Rice,news,"By Sarah Hannan 

 The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) on Tuesday (6) confiscated a consignment of 150 metric tonnes (MT) of rice stocks that was transported to an animal feed production processing factory in Ekala, Ja-Ela. 

 “Our team in the area was deployed following a tip-off we received over our hotline. Upon reaching the factory and following our team’s inspection of the 10 lorries that transported the rice stocks, it was revealed that the rice stocks had arrived from Polonnaruwa,” CAA Director of Consumer Affairs and Information Asela Bandara noted. 

 The rice stocks were found to be still suitable for human consumption, which is why the CAA had swiftly acted to confiscate the stocks of rice that were to be processed for animal feed. 

 CAA Maj. Gen. (Retd.) Shantha Dissanayake on 23 July 2020 issued an extraordinary gazette notification under gazette number 2185/67, prohibiting the purchase of rice or paddy suitable for human consumption to repurpose for animal feed or as an ingredient for the manufacture of animal feed.

,,Covid-19 Minuwangoda Cluster | Virus in factory weeks before detection,news,"By Maheesha Mudugamuwa 

 Ministry of Health Chief Epidemiologist Dr. Sudath Samaraweera noted that the apparel worker who was first diagnosed with the coronavirus last week was not the origin of the Covid-19 cluster at the Minuwangoda Brandix garment factory, and the virus may have been in the factory for several weeks. 

 According to Dr. Samaraweera, the employees of the Minuwangoda garment factory were suffering from respiratory ailments since 20 September. 

 He said that the Minuwangoda garment factory worker who was first diagnosed with the coronavirus had shown symptoms on 28 September and was admitted to the hospital on 30 September. 

 Therefore, the first patient identified was an intermediate patient who had previously been infected with the virus at the garment factory, and it is possible that the first patient may have recovered by now, he said. 

 He said that since the first patients to be reported were from the factory, and if symptoms had first appeared on 20 September, the virus would have entered the factory two weeks or more prior. 

 Commenting on the number of tests conducted at present, he said the authorities were currently conducting the maximum number of tests possible. “This is a big cluster and therefore, it takes some time to conduct the tests,” he said. 

 Dr. Samaraweera denied allegations levelled against the management of Brandix that they had ignored symptoms displayed by their employees and instead instructed them to continue their routine work. 

 When contacted by    The Morning   , Dr. Samaraweera said it was unfair to point fingers at the management at present when the whole country was ignoring the health guidelines and behaved like there was no Covid-19 threat at all.

,,COPE meeting uncovered irregularities in coal tender ,news," By Maheesha Mudugamuwa  

 The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) uncovered irregularities in coal tenders called by Lanka Coal Company (Pvt.) Ltd. (LCC) that caused the Government a loss of around Rs. 1.1 billion. 

 The losses were said to be incurred due to the non-specification of the quantity of coal required when calling for tenders for the purchase of raw material by the LCC, and it was also revealed that the company had purchased coal on a short-term basis without following the proper procurement process. 

 This was revealed at the recent COPE meeting presided by its Chairman Prof. Charitha Herath held at the Parliamentary Complex. A group of senior officials of the LCC who had been summoned to the COPE told the Committee that they had expected to take advantage of the fluctuations in market prices by purchasing coal on a short-term basis. 

 During the meeting, COPE Chairman Prof. Herath pointed out the need to handle tenders with the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers in accordance with the prescribed procurement process. 

 The Committee, however, directed the Secretary to the Ministry to submit an immediate report on the procedure followed in handing over the barges and the reasons for its inability to maintain them, and instructed officials to submit all reports on these matters within one month.

,,Rumour of Parliament staff member contracting virus,news," There is no truth in the rumours circulating on social media that a family member of a staff member of Parliament has tested positive for Covid-19, the Department of Communication of Parliament clarified. 

 Issuing a press release, the Department pointed out that the circulation of this news was based on a statement made by Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena in response to a concern raised by parliamentarian Shan Wijayalal De Silva at Parliament yesterday (8). 

 Accordingly, the Speaker had only stated that access for MPs and other individuals to the office of the Parliament Service Unit under the Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils in Pelawatta was not permitted on Wednesday (7) due to a suspicion that a relative of an employee has contracted the Covid-19.

,,Altair shareholders file legal action against PwC Sri Lanka,business,"The major shareholders of the Altair project have filed legal action in the District Court of Colombo against PricewaterhouseCoopers Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd. (PwC Sri Lanka), a leading professional body, for its alleged contribution to facilitate a hostile takeover of the Altair project in November 2019 through what the shareholders term a “fabricated and unauthorised” report.  

 “AA Infraproperties (Pvt.) Ltd., 100% owner of the Altair project together with its parent company South City Projects (Kolkata) Ltd. (plaintiffs) have filed legal action in the District Court of Colombo against PwC Sri Lanka along with Jaideep Halwasiya and Pradeep Moraes, who are alleged to be the main conspirators who perpetrated the hostile takeover,” the major shareholders said in a press statement. 

 The plaintiff in the District Court of Colombo appealed that the purported report was a “concerted act of conspiracy” of the three co-defendants, to create an environment to facilitate the said “fraudulent and hostile” takeover of Indocean Developers (Pvt.) Ltd. (IDPL), the Altair project company. 

 They said the Board of Directors of IDPL had never requested nor approved to commence or procced with any such investigative procedure with PwC Sri Lanka in early 2019. PwC has been acting as the internal auditor of IDPL since 2015. 

 As per the documents submitted with the Court by the plaintiffs’ counsel, the purported report was signed and published on 15   November last year by PwC Sri Lanka, although one of the directors representing the plaintiffs had supposedly raised their objections to the move.  

 “In fact, on the strength of the purported report, the director concerned along with (the) other director representing the plaintiff were removed from the Board of the Altair company as part of hostile takeover,” the statement read.  

 The District Court also issued an enjoining order preventing PwC Sri Lanka and other co-defendants from destroying the evidence of the alleged conspiracy. The material evidence ranges from emails to any other communication exchanged between the defendants that could be pertinent to prove there was a conspiracy between the defendants. 

 The plaintiffs allege that some parts of the report were drafted by Halwasiya and Moraes and not by PwC, which they say could be evident from the material evidence filed in the Court. Furthermore, it has been alleged that PwC has sought information privately and most of the data filed in the report were as per the direction of the conspirator co-defendants, thereby, failing to conduct a fair audit or verification. 

 It claimed that the directors of PwC Sri Lanka have used the corporate name of PwC in order to avoid personal liability for their fraud. Thus, it contended that all directors of PwC who are all public accountants practicing under the name and style of PwC are liable in person and hence plaintiffs argued that these individuals should incur unlimited personal liability in respect of assignments done under cover of PwC’s corporate name. 

 In addition, the plaintiffs already filed an oppression and mismanagement action under the Company’s Act, inter alia against Jaideep Halwasiya and Pradeep Moraes to take back the control of the project before the Commercial High Court, Colombo. 

 Halwasiya, who has   12.5% stake in   AA Infraproperties (Pvt.) Ltd., wherein South City Projects have 87.5% in AA Infraproperties, is accused of   seizing control of IDPL through issue of preferential shares to a Dubai-based company owned by his son and two of his business associates  . 

 In the process, AA Infraproperties’   shareholding was reduced to approximately 13% from 100%. 

 In 2018, t  he Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) barred Price Waterhouse from auditing any listed company in India for two years, saying that the firm was complicit with the main perpetrators of the Satyam fraud and did not comply with auditing standards.   SEBI also ordered disgorgement of over $ 1.75 million wrongful gains from the firm and two partners, referred to as “India’s Enron”. This action might perhaps be the first instance when the integrity of a professional accounting body was called into question by way of legal action in Sri Lanka, the statement said.

,,Feeling hopeless in the time of Covid-19,brunch," By Dimithri Wijesinghe 

 With the resurgence of the pandemic in the form of a second wave and the effects getting progressively more severe, the looming uncertainty has instilled a feeling of hopelessness amongst the general public. 
 SMKYA Co-Founder/Head Coach Samaakhya Gajanayake

 Once again, there has come a time where we must remind ourselves to not only take care of our physical wellbeing but also our mental health. 

 While everyone and anyone is understandably affected by the new developments – i.e. the spike in Covid-19 patients – there are those whom are especially vulnerable to the stresses that come with it. 

 Speaking to National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) senior consultant psychiatrist Dr. Pushpa Ranasinghe about the mental stresses likely to affect those of us during these turbulent times, she shared: “There are negatives and positives to this new wave we are experiencing. The negatives being that because we have experienced this once before and many have seen that there were only 13 deaths – persons who were having previous complications to begin with – it is likely that the public may take things lightly this time around, but what they may not realise is that the virus has the potential to change and become a different beast.” 

 However, she said, on a positive note: “The fact that we have already once lived through it brings forth a number of positives, the major one being that we have lived through it – we have seen what we must do and that when we do it, we can overcome it.” 

 Talking about the importance of mental health at these times, Dr. Ranasinghe shared: “There are many parties whom are under extreme stress right now; if you consider those in the tourism and export-import industries, they are under a lot of strain not being able to rely on their trade and livelihood. And since the lockdown, due to its effects on the economy, there have been many budget cuts and employees have been let go, which puts a lot of strain on the remaining employees as well; whereas a job that took 20 people to do would now be done by five people, thus putting them under a lot of pressure.” 

 She especially pointed out that young adults are particularly susceptible to stress, especially students preparing for Advanced Level (A/L) examinations and such other exams that are important milestones in their lives. 

 “Students sitting exams are especially vulnerable considering they have had to play the waiting game; the uncertainty can be extremely stressful and the World Health Organisation (WHO) predicted that there will be a 20% spike in suicide rates globally, primarily due to those who need mental health services not having access to it and also because early detection is compromised. 

“This is because loved ones and family, who often detect the mental state of a suicidal person and thereby aid in preventing it, are less likely to be attuned to the needs of those in distress due to being preoccupied with maintaining their physical health and also securing daily meals and getting by.” 

 However, she did point out that there are things to look forward to if you are at all concerned about walking into an exam hall whilst fearing that there is really no escape form this pandemic’s effects. 

 “There are some positives for students taking exams as they are expected to show up for the exams. Sri Lanka recently had an election and while it was predicted that following the election there would be a spike in cases, there were no such reports and so we have a great case study proving that if you are to follow what the health authorities say and follow the guidelines, then you can avoid being at risk,” she said. 

 Considering that students sitting exams are likely to be under a lot of stress during this time, we reached out to SMKYA Co-Founder/Head Coach Samaakhya Gajanayake, known for her motivation routines online and her fitness brand SMKYA, for some advice for the youths, especially those preparing for the A/L examinations. 

 Here’s what Samaakhya had to say: “Preparing for exams during a pandemic sounds like a proper nightmare! But why not make these strange times work for you? Here are my top tips on how to make the best of this unusual situation.” 

A method to your madness  

 Of course, it’s easy and tempting to lie in bed all day, but a bit of planning is important. Working to a schedule does not mean overworking. It simply means you balance out your work and leisure time. Some options like writing a to-do list, using Google Calendar, making a timetable, sharing your schedule with a friend, etc. will help you divide your time equally between your studies/chores and your hobbies and fun activities. 

Easier to work when working out!  

 Working out is not only about getting fit and strong. Did you know that exercise promotes brain development, concentration, and your mood?! Sounds like everything you need to get some studies done. Make it simple and fun. Go for a walk or a jog, try some home workouts or a bit of yoga. There's plenty of experts who have exciting options online. 

Life happens offline!  

 At this stage, social media might seem like the only thing keeping you in touch with the world and helping your sanity, but time away from the screen is a must. Most apps help you keep track of how long you spend online. Use that to see if you're living more online than in the real world. This can help you focus and concentrate. 

Work on your best version  

 Finally, spend as much time as you can on yourself, because it’s unlikely we will get another break from reality like this one! Reflect and look back and always ask yourself: What can I do to be a better version of myself?

,,Dwayne Bravo retires from international cricket,sports,"West Indies all-rounder Dwayne Bravo has called time on his international career. He will however continue to play franchise T20 cricket across the world.
Today I want to confirm to the cricket world that I have officially retired from international cricket in all formats of the game.

The 35-year-old made his debut in 2004, and played 40 Tests, 164 ODIs and 66 T20Is, although his last international appearance was more than two years ago, in a T20I against Pakistan in September 2016.

In a statement released to the media, Bravo said, ""Today I want to confirm to the cricket world that I have officially retired from international cricket in all formats of the game. After 14 years when I made my debut for the West Indies, I still remember that moment I received the maroon cap before walking onto the Lords Cricket Ground against England in July 2004. The enthusiasm and passion I felt then, I have kept with me throughout my career.

""However, I must accept that for me to preserve my longevity as a professional cricketer, I must do as others before have done, leave the international arena for the next generation of players.""

Bravo played his last Test in 2010, and had gradually transformed into a T20 specialist in the past few years. The combination of his big-hitting ability, athletic fielding, and canny bowling with an assortment of slower balls and change-ups made him a much sough-after figure in T20 cricket the world over.

His last ODI was in 2014, the fourth match of the dramatic series against India in Dharamsala, after which the West Indies flew home in protest against their board, cutting the tour short. Bravo was the captain of the ODI side then, and at the toss, the full squad stood behind him, symbolically backing his decision.

With his announcement, Bravo has drawn a line under any potential international comeback. As recently as before West Indies' ongoing tour of India, there had been talk of Bravo, among others, possibly making it to the national team.

He ends with 2200 runs at an average of 31.42 in Tests, with three centuries, to go with 86 wickets at 39.83. In ODIs, he made 2968 runs at 25.36, with a strike-rate of 82.30, while taking 199 wickets at 29.51 with an economy rate of 5.41.

""I thank the countless persons who were instrumental to my success, particularly my family and QPCC where I developed my skills at an early age,"" Bravo said. ""I thank the many loyal fans who continue to support my journey and who recognize my efforts on and off the field. I am extremely fortunate to have a career that has taken me across the globe into the most prestigious dressing rooms sharing experiences with all the recent legends of this glorious game. I will continue my professional career as a cricketer and entertainer living as a true champion.""

,,World Bank forecasts major recession for SL even without new wave,business,"By The Sunday Morning Business Desk 

 A World Bank report compiled prior to the detection of the new and largest Covid-19 cluster in Sri Lanka projects the island’s economy to contract by -6.7% this year, which would point to a far more severe contraction if the ongoing situation in the country is taken into account.  

 The forecast specifies that 30 September, the end of the third quarter, was the cut-off date for the report, which is four days prior to the detection of the Minuwangoda cluster, which means the ongoing health situation and curfews have not been taken into account in this forecast. 

 The report titled “Beaten or Broken? Informality and Covid-19” was released on 8 October and highlights that Sri Lanka avoided large-scale domestic transmission and experienced only a very small number of infections per capita.  

 Despite Sri Lanka’s “success” in containing domestic transmission as mentioned in the report, the projected GDP decline of 6.7% has been attributed to a number of factors including the impact on exports, private consumption, and investment.  

 “Tax revenues fell short due to the fiscal stimulus package implemented in November 2019, which included a reduction of the Value Added Tax (VAT) rate and an increase of the registration threshold, and severe disruptions in economic activity. As a result, despite a moderation in public investment, the overall budget deficit increased,” the report adds. 

 The forecast has also been attributed to the rise of the central government debt-to-GDP ratio to over 90% as of end-April 2020 (from 86.8% at the end of last year), with more than half of the debt denominated in foreign currency. 

 Nevertheless, the report says that Sri Lanka would be able to more than recover GDP losses under the pandemic by 2025, given the mitigation of domestic transmission before 4 October.  

 Furthermore, the baseline forecast suggests that Sri Lanka’s external debt will be very high compared to exports and remittance receipts. The report also projects Sri Lankan economy to grow by 3.3% next year, which could also be revised significantly in light of recent developments.  

 Last month, First Capital Research (FCR) estimated that Sri Lanka’s GDP would see its steepest contraction in history of -5.8% in 2020 following the unexpected contraction in Q1 GDP growth of -1.6%. This forecast too came before the latest outbreak.  

 The initial growth forecast of the World Bank for Sri Lanka for 2020 was 3.3%.  ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,World Bank forecasts major recession for SL even without new wave,business,0,1602367245,0,100519,,
,,Apparel industry rallies around workers,business,"JAAFSL, exporters, MAS defend workforce  
 
 By Madhusha Thavapalakumar 

 After fingers were pointed at apparel sector workers following the detection of the new Covid-19 cluster, leading to creating social stigma, apparel associations and leading apparel companies have come to their defence. 

 Joint Apparel Association Forum Sri Lanka (JAAFSL) Secretary General Tuli Cooray told    The Sunday Morning Business    that it is concerning to see the stigma surrounding apparel workers following the detection of the cluster, conveniently disregarding the fact that these workers contribute significantly to the gross domestic product (GDP) of Sri Lanka. 

 “Why can’t people understand that apparel workers are a part of society too? This could have happened to anyone from any sector. Do not attack them, do not criminalise them, and certainly do not disrespect them,” Cooray stated. 

 Sri Lanka Apparel Exporters’ Association (SLAEA) Chairman Rehan Lakhany too vehemently condemned the allegations, labelling them as mere “personal opinions”. 

 “I have seen negative reports accusing the entire apparel sector and its workers circulating since last Sunday (4). What I can say is they are not true in any way. Stigmatising the apparel industry and its workers has always been the culture. What we should do now is get together and emerge from this situation as one,” Lakhany told us. 

 Health authorities last Sunday detected a Covid-19 case in the community for the first time in about two months – an apparel factory worker from the Gampaha District attached to Brandix Apparel Solutions Ltd. in Minuwangoda. Subsequent PCR tests conducted on the patient’s close contacts detected the largest cluster found in Sri Lanka, and the cluster mainly consisted of the workers who worked in the same apparel factory. 

 Brandix Apparel Ltd. and MAS Holdings (Pvt.) Ltd. are the two largest apparel companies in Sri Lanka. When contacted by us, an official spokesperson for MAS stated that MAS is hopeful that no lasting negative perceptions have been created regarding apparel workers or the industry. 

 “We are optimistic that no lasting negative perceptions have been created by this latest outbreak on the 300,000-plus associates employed by our industry directly, or indeed to the larger community to whom it provides indirect livelihood,” he added. 

 Social media posts and several news reports were quick to point the finger at Brandix, accusing them of not adhering to health guidelines and of forcing workers to report to work despite increased body temperature. In addition to this, Brandix was also accused of bringing down Indian nationals to their facility without requiring them to be quarantined upon arrival in Sri Lanka. 

 Meanwhile, clarifying concerns pertaining to their facility in Minuwangoda on Wednesday (7), Brandix stated that they have identified the primary female party is the owner of a hostel, while the two members occupying her hostel and the supervisor being referred to are employed by a third-party cleaning service provider contracted by the Brandix Minuwangoda facility. 

 The company also denied providing access to any party from India or any other country to the facility during this period. 

 “We operated three chartered flights from Visakhapatnam, India for our Sri Lankan employees working in India and their families, who returned to Sri Lanka. We confirm that they, including their families, followed the Sri Lanka Government protocol for the prevention and control of Covid-19, which includes PCR testing and a 14-day mandatory quarantine at a government-regulated quarantine facility, as well as the 14-day self-quarantine process done under the supervision of the respective PHIs. Further to this, it must also be noted that none of these Sri Lankans nor their family members visited the Minuwangoda manufacturing facility,” the statement from Brandix added. 

 Commenting on these allegations against Brandix, Cooray stated that in no way would the company have been negligent in terms of the safety of its workers, as it is one of the companies that adheres to all the health guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health. 

 “Brandix is one of the best companies in the world. I do not think these allegations are true and I cannot accept them,” he added. 

 Speaking on the accusations against Brandix, Lakhany explained that the apparel workers from this particular company were asymptomatic and, if at all, the maximum the company could do is check the temperature of the employees, mandate washing hands before entering the building, and wearing a mask. 

 When the first case of this cluster went almost undetected even by hospitals, how can we expect an apparel company to detect it merely by checking the body temperature, Lakhany questioned. 

 Both Lakhany and Cooray expect the ongoing situation to have an impact on the apparel sector, but quantifying the impact at this stage is premature, according to Lakhany. Nevertheless, both of them assured that the industry has already provided the necessary facilities in terms of safety to its workers. 

 Meanwhile, MAS confirmed to us that they continue to adhere to stringent protocols and health guidelines over and above those stipulated by local authorities across all MAS facilities. Employees are provided with protective gear, regular sanitisation, and other standard operating protocols that include social distancing on production floors, cafeterias, and production meetings, stringent temperature checks, as well as restricted interactions between external parties and team members belonging to different shifts, it said. 

 “MAS also places all raw material sourced from external suppliers in quarantine for 24 hours to eliminate any possibilities of virus transmission from material surfaces,” the company noted.

,,"Curfew or not, CSE to stay open",business,"By The Sunday Morning Business 

 The newly digitalised Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) is set to remain open for trading regardless of whether or not the Government opts for an islandwide curfew, quite unlike the lockdown period following the first Covid-19 outbreak in Sri Lanka when the country was kept closed for a staggering seven weeks. 

 Speaking on behalf of the regulator of the CSE, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Director of External Relations and Surveillance Tushara Jayaratne told    The Sunday Morning Business    that the recent digitalisation that was carried out at the CSE rules out the need for a market closure. 

 “There will certainly not be a closure of the market this time. With the digitalisation, a Central Depository System (CDS) can be opened from your mobile without having to visit the CSE. Customers will get all the required information and verification through e-mails. During the lockdown in March, we had issues as our platform was not digitalised,” Jayaratne stated. 

 According to Jayaratne, payment settlement was rendered impossible during the previous occasion, which necessitated the market closure, but digitalisation has addressed this issue too. The digitalised platform requires CDS account holders to provide their bank details to make sure that settlement would be done even during a curfew as the banking sector remained active even during the previous lockdown. 

 “We gave maximum publicity for this digitalised platform. There are about 800,000 CDS accounts. Most of the active account holders have already provided their email addresses and account numbers. They cannot trade if they have not provided these details,” he added. 

 Meanwhile, CSE Chairman Dumith Fernando too told us that the necessary infrastructure and systems are in place to ensure the market remains operational during a possible curfew. 

 “The CSE conducted business continuity exercises to ensure we are able to operate the market remotely. The CSE and the stock broker firms are satisfied with the outcome of these exercises and the robustness of the systems to continue uninterrupted stock market operations,” Fernando stated. 

 On 17 September, CSE became digitalised with the conversion of paper-based statements to electronic forms to facilitate companies listed on the CSE to pay dividends electronically to shareholders. Furthermore, the CSE launched a new CSE mobile app for end-to-end digital onboarding and online account opening that removes the barriers to entry for new investors, enabling any eligible prospective investor around the country to open a CDS account to trade in the market without the need to visit a branch office. 

 The digitalisation also featured the revamp of CSE and SEC digital touch points including new CSE, SEC, and CDS websites that were re-launched with “user-friendly” interfaces to offer users an informative browsing experience covering trading information, regulatory information, as well as investor-centric information maintained by the CDS. 

 With the new online account opening feature offered by the CSE mobile app, prospective investors can begin investing instantly with their account opening, trading, and settlement, and monitor their accounts remotely. 

 The CSE was closed from 20 March to 10 May mainly due to the inability of being physically present at the CSE to undertake usual operations as well as due to restricted mobility, according to the CSE. Nevertheless, the seven-week-long market closure created uncertainties amongst the investors, particularly among foreign investors who were unhappy that they were being prevented from pulling out their investments in a volatile market situation.

,,A killer blow for events industry,business,"By Uwin Lugoda 

 The new cluster of coronavirus infections, which has been spreading across Sri Lanka, and its ramifications may prove fatal to some companies in the local events industry, according to industry leaders. 

 According to Event Management Association (EMA) Vice President Kamesh Malwana, event management companies are back in the deep-end due to the cancellations that took place following the most recent outbreak. 

 Speaking to    The Sunday Morning Business   , he explained that most event management companies were just beginning to recover from the initial Covid-19 outbreak in March 2020, with (with each company having) five to six confirmed events and more pending. However, with the resurgence of the virus, these companies are now suffering a mass cancellation of events. 

 “The industry was just picking up after the last lockdown and we were waiting for December, during which time we usually have the most events. But now we are losing our income all over again with this situation,” he said. 

 Malwana stated that some companies have already shut down due to bankruptcy while others are mainly managing from their personal savings. He stated that the industry has been suffering consecutively for the past two years, firstly due to the Easter Sunday attack in 2019 and now due to the pandemic. 

 “We are among the first to be affected by these tragedies, so we are hoping the Government will give us a helping hand in order to restart our industry. If not, this will lead to more unemployment from the event management sector,” he added. 

 Similar to Malwana, The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) President Sanath Ukwatte also lamented the cancellation of events scheduled to be held at hotels. He explained that the new cluster of cases has had adverse effects on the industry, which was solely depending on the local market. 

 “A lot of events have been cancelled, both current ones and others that were booked for the future, like weddings. People are very reluctant to have events in the current environment. But we understand the need for restrictions since the safety of the country is our priority, so we need to take stock of the situation and then find a solution from there,” he emphasised. 

 However, Malwana stated that the association has already written to the Ministry of Health, requesting a meeting to discuss the guidelines for events. He agreed that they need to enforce strict guidelines and this should be done in consultation with the EMA. 

 He stated that the industry will also need a grace period on making payments to banks and financial institutions as the moratorium will not help due to the interest being accumulated. 

 “Business will not come up all at once; it will take some time to gradually pick up again. So the Government will have to help our industry with the current situation because it is practically impossible for us to pay salaries and (bear) other expenses without any income. Unlike other industries, ours is one of the first to be affected in situations like this,” he added. 

 Local authorities announced a ban to all public gatherings on 6 October, following the detection of a new Covid-19 cluster which brought the total number of confirmed cases to 4,252 as of 8 October. The Government then revised the timeline of public activities on 7 October. 

 The timeline stated that public activities from 4 October to 31 October will have to strictly follow the new normal procedures. It categorised public activities into four segments of “No Operations”, “Higher Restrictions”, “Restricted”, and “Normal Operations”, with primarily only weddings and funerals allowed to continue, with general measures of physical distancing, respiratory etiquette, hand washing, and wearing face masks applying to all of them.

,,"Vehicle import restrictions: Protest and we’ll consider, says Ramesh",business,"Over 60% of vehicle dealerships closed  
 
 By Madhusha Thavapalakumar 

The Government will consider a relaxation of the vehicle import ban only if the general public takes to the streets in protest against vehicle import restrictions, according to Co-Cabinet Spokesman Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana. 

 “If the general public gets on the road, protesting for new vehicles to be imported, then we might think about it. But for now, our concern is protecting our reserves,” he said on Thursday (8). 

 The Minister added that even if the vehicle importers have run out unregistered stocks, they could still keep the businesses going in terms of the second-hand vehicle market. 

 He stated this responding to a query by    The Sunday Morning Business    about the stance of the Government on the fact that over 60% of vehicle dealerships have closed down their showrooms and there are only about 1,000 vehicles at showrooms islandwide at the moment. 

 These figures were revealed to us by Vehicle Importers’ Association Lanka (VIAL) President Indika Sampath Merenchige who charged that much of the industry has already gone out of business due to the prevailing stringent restrictions on vehicle imports. He added that the rest of the dealerships too will join the exit queue soon. 

 “Even though the Government said there is enough of a vehicle stock for more than two years, at the moment there are only about 1,000 vehicles at showrooms islandwide. After selling these vehicles, all vehicle dealerships have to shut down their business,” Merenchige stated. 

 The permanent closure of vehicle dealerships has been doubled within the past month, as in early September, the VIAL noted that only 25% of the vehicle dealerships closed down as they sold out their stocks. 

 However, Dr. Pathirana maintained that the Government does not see a dire need to import vehicles at the moment, as unregistered vehicles could be seen idling at dealerships. 

 “We understand the plight of vehicle importers, but these import restrictions are not only for them, it is for all importers in the country. Moreover, there are still enough vehicles at vehicle showrooms,” Dr. Pathirana added. 

 On a further note, he stated that even if vehicle importers have run out unregistered stocks, they could still keep the businesses going in terms of the second-hand vehicle market. 

 The Minister added that the Government is yet to look at an alternative option for vehicle importers. 

 Speaking to us in September, Merenchige expressed his dissatisfaction over the way the vehicle industry is being treated by the Government, despite the colossal sum of tax revenue the Government made through vehicle imports. 

 Debt moratoriums and financial relief packages that were announced following the Easter Sunday incident last year were not made available to the vehicle industry, even though the industry has been facing a financially tough period since late 2018. 

 Exacerbating the industry’s misery, the Government restricted imports following the local spread of Covid-19 in mid-March this year in order to avoid a possible foreign exchange crisis amidst a crippled global and national economy. 

 Even though the initial ban on vehicle imports was imposed only as a short-term measure, the Government later on announced that vehicle imports would be restricted for another two years. They also ruled out a possible vehicle shortage by stating that the country has enough vehicles in stock for the next two years. 

 In 2019, Sri Lanka spent about $ 815.7 million on vehicle imports, compared to $ 1.5 billion the previous year. In August, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka stated that expenditure on motor vehicle imports declined by 80.9% due to the import restriction measures taken by the Government and the Central Bank since March 2020.

,,Rabies among jackals | Authorities struggle to vaccinate,news,"By Skandha Gunasekara 

Authorities are facing difficulties in controlling the spread of the rabies virus among jackal populations in certain parts of the country due to the impracticality of vaccinating the animal.

Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) Director of Wildlife Health Dr. Tharaka Prasad said that it was not possible to vaccinate foxes.

“We are facing several issues, foremost of which is the impracticality of vaccinating foxes. We cannot vaccinate through injection but through their food source, which in turn could pose additional risks to humans.” Rabies transmitted by jackals is believed to have claimed the lives of two people already. Dr. Prasad explained that the chewable form of the vaccine also contains a virus that could be harmful to humans, if transmitted.

“It’s a type of vaccinia. It is harmless to the foxes and helps with the vaccination process, but the vaccinia virus can harm other animals and can be deadly if transmitted to humans.”

The rabies outbreak which began in Milleniyawa has now spread to neighbouring regions. He said the Ministry of Health is carrying large-scale vaccinations of dogs in Horana, where the rabies virus is currently concentrated.

“The dogs are being vaccinated and this can stop it from transmitting to humans. Once all the dogs are vaccinated, even if an infected jackal bites one of these animals, the dogs would not get sick and pass it on to humans.” Initially, the rabies outbreak had begun in Milleniyawa and is now spreading to other areas including Horana, Pugoda, and Ingiriya.",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Rabies among jackals | Authorities struggle to vaccinate,news,0,1602365433,0,100531,,
,,PM invites more Chinese money,news," By Maheesha Mudugamuwa 

Former Minister of Foreign Affairs of China and current Communist Party Political Bureau member Yang Jiechi met Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa on 09 October 2020 at Temple Trees, Colombo.

Despite long-running concerns of a Chinese economic takeover of Sri Lanka and so-called “debt trap diplomacy”, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa on Friday (9) invited more Chinese companies to invest in Sri Lanka.

At a meeting held with a high-level Chinese delegation led by former Minister of Foreign Affairs of China and current Communist Party Political Bureau member Yang Jiechi at Temple Trees, the Prime Minister said that he expected that the Chinese Government would be able to encourage Chinese companies to come and invest in Sri Lanka, adding that it would help generate export earnings as well as create employment opportunities for Sri Lankans, especially young people.

The Government is interested in accepting investments from around the world and the priority is the Port City of Colombo, he added.

In a controversial meeting held with the Chinese delegation that did not undergo the compulsory 14-day quarantine process in Sri Lanka prior to the meeting, the Prime Minister pointed out that the tourism sector had been severely impacted globally and that Sri Lanka is committed to rebuilding its tourism industry and providing a safe haven for tourists from around the world, based on the advice of health authorities.

The Prime Minister said he hoped to work closely with the Chinese Government to find collective solutions to the common challenges posed by the pandemic, including the global fight to end it and the development of economic ties in Sri Lanka. Addressing the meeting, Jiechi said that the Chinese Government has always encouraged Chinese companies to invest in Sri Lanka.

“China has already contributed to the development process in Sri Lanka, especially relating to the Colombo Port City and other projects. The tourism sector is very important for the relationship between the two countries. We hope that those relations will continue as soon as the Covid-19 situation is brought under control. China has increased imports of local products from Sri Lanka,” Jiechi added.

,,SLTB confident of comeback,news,"Restrictions cause Rs. 20 m daily loss  
 
By Skandha Gunasekara 

The Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) is confident of bouncing back once the Covid19 outbreak has been contained, despite incurring a loss of Rs. 20 million daily.

“We were incurring heavy losses when Covid19 initially hit the country but we were able to make a good comeback and cut our losses greatly. But now again another cluster has emerged and we are facing difficulties,” SLTB Chairman Kingsley Ranawaka told  The Sunday Morning .

He said that the SLTB has no choice but to operate and the main issue is that there are hardly any commuters due to the fear of using public transport.

The Government this week called on buses to only carry passengers equivalent to the seating capacity.

Thereafter, private bus associations took a decision to reduce their operating fleet by half to reduce losses.

,,UK waste containers | SL demands Rs. 1.6 b,news,"By Sarah Hannan 

The Sri Lankan Government submitted a written demand for compensation of Rs. 1.69 billion from the UK Government for the 263 containers filled with waste that were imported to Sri Lanka in 2017,  The Sunday Morning  learnt.

The complaint letter was sent to the Basel Convention Secretariat under the United Nations (UN) Environment Programme, which oversees controlling transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal, who will in turn co-ordinate the matter with the UK.

A total of Rs. 1,694,274,751 has been demanded as compensation for holding the waste containers in Sri Lanka over the past three years. Minister of Environment Mahinda Amaraweera on Tuesday (6) stated that in the years 2017-2018, a private company had imported 263 containers that were full of waste from the UK in violation of the regulations stipulated in the Basel Convention.

“According to the Basel Convention, waste can be transhipped from one country to another if a bilateral agreement is signed. However, investigations revealed that these waste containers were brought down to Sri Lanka through a Sri Lankan living in the UK with the assistance of a sibling who was based in Sri Lanka. We have therefore forwarded a written complaint on 6 October to the Basel Convention Secretariat demanding compensation,” Minister of Environment Amaraweera noted.

130 waste containers were held at the Katunayake Free Trade Zone while the rest of the 133 waste containers were held at the Colombo Port.

On 27 September, 21 waste containers out of the 133 that were held at the Colombo Port were shipped back to the UK following investigations.

,,Dead turtles from oil spill?,news," 
           Reports due this week  
 
 By Sarah Hannan 

The Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) is trying to determine if the carcasses of turtles and porpoises that were washed ashore on the coastline were a result of the recent MT New Diamond bunker oil spill.

“We have added remarks to run tests on the porpoise carcasses to see whether there are traces of bunker oil ingestion in their respiratory tracts,” MEPA General Manager Dr. Terney Pradeep Kumara told  The Sunday Morning  on Friday (9), referring to the report from the post mortems.

Over 10 carcasses of turtles and porpoises were washed ashore on the coastal belt from the west via the southern coast to the east over a span of one week. With the beaches having a heavy footfall, it had been the visitors who had alerted Coast Conservation Department (CCD) officials, who had in return informed the MEPA, the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC), and the National Zoological Department in Dehiwala and alerted them regarding the incident to take necessary action.

“We gathered the carcasses and sent it to the Zoological Department which will conduct the post-mortem procedures to identify the cause of deaths. In the meantime, we also lodged a complaint at the Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia Police, should legal action be sought,” CCD officials said.

The toxicology reports are due this week, according to the MEPA. MEPA General Manager Dr. Kumara said: “The cause of the deaths is still unknown and we are awaiting the report from the post-mortem examinations and can only come to a conclusion after the toxicology report is submitted. The carcasses are now at the lab and we would be getting the earliest of the reports by Tuesday (13).”

 The Sunday Morning  also contacted DWC Director General Chandana Sooriyabandara to inquire as to whether it was common for turtles to succumb in such conditions. “Turtles and porpoises surface to take their breaths and especially in the case of turtles, this is a time that they come ashore to lay eggs. There is a probability that they were caught by fishing nets or were injured by the propellers of the trawler engines. However, we can only share the findings after the reports are submitted to the courts next week.”

Both the MEPA and the DWC are awaiting the reports and the court decision on pronouncing the cause of deaths of these marine creatures, and should there be a correlation to the bunker oil spill that was caused by the MT New Diamond when it was held in the Sri Lankan territorial waters after it faced an accident last month, then these turtle and porpoise deaths would be added as evidence of marine environment pollution caused by the incident.

When asked about the legal proceedings to claim the damages caused to the marine environment from the owners of the MT New Diamond and whether Sri Lanka will have to go to international courts for hearings, Dr. Kumara told  The Sunday Morning : “The MT New Diamond has appointed two local legal representative agencies that are now representing them in court. They are handling the legal proceedings for the Captain of the MT New Diamond, who is held in custody and will also handle the claims case that we are filing for marine environment pollution.”

The MEPA is currently working closely with the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) to conduct the routine sampling from the bunker oil spill site and will observe the changes in marine life behaviour for the next three years. NARA Environmental Studies Division Head K.W.S. Weerasekara, speaking to  The Sunday Morning , noted that on Friday, they had collected another batch of water samples and had logged in the behavioural observations, which they are to share with the MEPA.

“The water and bunker oil mixed water samples will be sent to the Government Analyst’s Department and to our very own laboratory for testing, for which the results will be issued in a span of about five working days,” Weerasekara explained.",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Dead turtles from oil spill?,news,0,1602365420,0,100541,,

“We can conduct more than 4,000 tests per day, and conducting tests for factory employees will not be a problem for the government laboratories,” he said, adding that the SLGMLT was not consulted by the BOI before making the request.

He went on to charge that there were issues regarding the tests conducted by the private hospitals as there was nobody to take responsibility.

When contacted, Association of Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes (APHNH) President Dr. Lakith Peiris told  The Sunday Morning  that the respective private hospitals should take responsibility over the PCR tests conducted by them.

Earlier, following the BOI request, Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP S.M. Marikkar raised concerns over the inability of the government hospitals to conduct PCR tests, stressing that the factory owners would have to bear the total cost of the PCR tests, which would be millions of rupees.

MP Marikkar further noted that taking into consideration the situation faced by the factory owners due to the Covid-19 pandemic-related financial crisis, the factory owners would be further hampered by the decision taken by the BOI.",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,No need pvt. hospitals testing factory workers: Medical Lab Technologists,news,0,1602365417,0,100543,,
,,"After JICA, Govt. removes ADB",news,"Dumped from Kelani Valley railway project  
Was involved from 2016  
 
By Maheesha Mudugamuwa 

Following the controversial removal of the Japan International Co-operation Agency (JICA) from the Colombo Light Rail Transit Project (LRT), the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) has now removed Asian Development Bank (ADB) from the Kelani Valley Railway Improvement Programme,  The Sunday Morning  learnt.

This is according to a letter sent by ADB to Institution of Engineers Sri Lanka (IESL) President Eng. (Prof.) Sarath Abayakoon dated 20 September 2020, which was seen by  The Sunday Morning .

The letter, signed by ADB Director – South Asia Regional Department Ravi Peri, reveals that ADB has been removed from the Kelani Valley project. “We write in reference to the letter dated 9 September 2020 on the review of the Kelani Valley (KV) Line feasibility study and remaining sections of the Colombo Suburban Railway Project (CSRP).

The Kelani Valley Railway Improvement Programme was earlier listed in ADB’s Country Operations Business Plan (COBP). However, ADB was advised by the Department of External Resources, Ministry of Finance, that the ADB loan for the KV Line has been removed from the COBP for Sri Lanka.

As such, there is now no railway project in ADB’s operation planning for Sri Lanka. We therefore suggest that IESL may engage with government on this matter and any implications for the Main Line, Coastal Line, and Puttalam Line under the CSRP, as well as the Kandy Suburban Railway Project,” it stated.

For the KV Line project, the prefeasibility consultants had been mobilised in 2016 after signing agreements for an ADB grant of $ 1 million. The consultation was completed and the draft final report was issued in November 2017, while the stakeholder workshop was also held in November 2017.

At present, the following reports have already been submitted: final report of the pre-feasibility consultancy, KV Line alternative study, train control centre evaluation, long-distance railway service evaluation, and ticketing system evaluation.

The detailed design consultation for the development initiatives identified by the pre-feasibility study was initiated in February 2017. The procurement was completed and the detailed design consultants were mobilised in 2018. This was initiated through an ADB loan of $ 10 million.

The scope of the consultancy was to carry out a feasibility study and detailed designs for the KV Line, the Main Line, the Coastal Line, and the Puttalam Line. The procurement for consultancy commenced in October 2017 and the expression of interest (EOI) had been called.

Twenty-one consultancy firms submitted their interest; the evaluation has now been completed and six shortlisted organisations will be issued with “request for proposal” documents.

As learnt by  The Sunday Morning , since the ADB has been removed from the project, there was no official funding partner for the project as of now and the project is at a standstill at present. Nevertheless, when contacted by  The Sunday Morning , Transport Minister Gamini Lokuge noted that the KV Line would be upgraded soon with a doubleline system. However, he did not speak about the availability of funding.",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,"After JICA, Govt. removes ADB",news,0,1602367258,0,100546,,
,,China offers financial support for Indo-Pacific security,focus," Photos by Indika Handuwala   Bullet Points:  ·        US asserts importance of stability  ·        India raises concerns over State sponsored terrorism  ·        Sri Lanka notes challenges and threats   By Easwaran Rutnam  The Galle Dialogue 2018 held in Colombo last week saw maritime powerhouses US, China and India noting the importance of the security in the Indo-Pacific region. China went a step further by offering financial support for security in the region and to jointly shoulder maritime security responsibilities. The Naval Command College (NCC) Commandant and Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Rear Admiral Han Xiaohu said, that on the basis of respecting Indian Ocean regional countries’ core interests and great concerns, China would like to join hands with regional and ex-regional countries to discuss extensively on maritime security topics, to contribute maritime security governance wisdom, to exchange counter piracy experiences, to shoulder stability maintenance obligations, to provide financial support for security and to jointly shoulder maritime security responsibilities. He asserted that the Indian Ocean regional security situation is quite complex and severe, and no single country can handle the situation, and ensure everlasting security. Meanwhile the US Navy participating at the conference said that US military presence in the Indo-Pacific region continues to be a source of stability and cooperative engagement in the region. Submarine Group 7/ and Task Force-54/74 Commander Rear Admiral James Pitts said that as a nation with global interests, the United States has a vital self interest in maritime security and enduring commitments to its allies and partners throughout the world.  “In Asia and the Indo-Pacific, these commitments have been longstanding, and encompass a broad spectrum of cooperative engagements and operations to include, collaborative activities with our five Mutual Defence Treaty allies in the Pacific, bi-lateral and multi-lateral military exercises, economic investments, information sharing, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, and sometimes decisive military action,” he said. Rear Admiral James Pitts said that US maritime strategy encourages US agencies and foreign countries to work together, to share information, to become more efficient and effective. He said that greater emphasis has been placed on building relationships with international partners, while relying less on unilateral solutions to crisis. Meanwhile, Indian Navy Deputy Chief of Naval Staff Vice Admiral G. Ashok Kumar said that global terrorism continues to acquire new dimensions by the day. He said that the reach, access to technology, organisational flexibility and financing avenues that terrorist organisations enjoy today is unprecedented. “India has been a victim of State sponsored terrorism for many years now. Unfortunately, this threat has evolved faster than many of us had anticipated and is no longer confined to a country or region. It has, in every sense, acquired a global reach and influence,” he said. Vice Admiral G. Ashok Kumar said that a worrying trend in the Indian Ocean Region has been the proliferation of violent non-state actors and networks at sea, which harbours numerous challenges and demands a recalibrated outlook to collective maritime security. “Maritime piracy and maritime terrorism are the two major ways in which non-state actors threaten to jeopardise the security of the maritime domain, with a direct influence on land affairs,” he said. Meanwhile, Defence Secretary Kapila Waidyaratne said that due to Sri Lanka’s geo-strategic position and easy access to the Indian Ocean, its role to secure and promote a peaceful environment in the Indian Ocean is clear to the entire world. But he says there are many challenges and threats. “These challenges could only be mitigated through regional and extra regional collaborative measure while expanding the information network and thereby to reinforce the capacity to contain maritime challenges to an appreciable level,” he added.

,,Nuwara Eliya Golf Club | What next?,focus,"The following response was forwarded by Dian Abeywardene as a follow-up to the article we published Sunday 20 September titled 'Nuwara Eliya Golf Club | In the rough'

 The Special General Meeting (SGM) of the Nuwara Eliya Golf Club (NEGC) proceeded as scheduled on 19 September, with the Judge at the District Court (DC) of Nuwara Eliya refusing to issue the enjoining order to stop the SGM. 

 It was on 14 September that three plaintiffs, namely  D. S. Abeyewardene (myself), Rev. L. S. Joshua, and K.M.A.Waheed Mohamed from Nuwara Eliya , filed a petition in the District Court Nuwara Eliya seeking an enjoining order to restrain the holding of the SGM on 19 September 2020 based on the fact that a rule in the Constitution via Clause 2(e) which had been violated cannot be retrospectively passed after the funds have been spent exceeding Rs. 500,000. 

 The DC Judge refused to consider the request of issuing the enjoining order to halt the SGM from taking place on 19 September, where the NEGC Committee was to convene to pass a resolution to “retrospectively” approve funds already spent on the construction of  12 new rooms that was speculated earlier which is now found to be a new 'annexe'  comprising a hall, sitting room, pantry kitchen etc.  

 The Judge issued notice of the action to the defendants to be served to hear the plaint made against the defendants and fixed a date on 15 October 2020, for the defendants to appear in Court. 

 Although Ranjan Gooneratne wrote a letter of demand to the Committee claiming that the SGM be not held as it is a violation of the Constitution – “sine die” – and the SGM is illegal and void ab initio (the SGM is dead from the beginning because the violation of Clause 2(e) is very clear; the Committee cannot spend in excess of Rs. 500,000 without calling an SGM and getting the approval of the members prior to spending club finds. And you cannot give life to what is already dead). 

 Furthermore, Priath Fernando had communicated directly with the NEGC Secretary &amp; General Committee on the issues of the SGM passing a Resolution with Retrospective effect. 

 Notwithstanding the request from Ranjan Gooneratne, the Committee proceeded to canvas proxies and arranged a coach to carry NEGC members living in Colombo (approx. 40 members) on NEGC account to attend the SGM. In addition to that, 300-plus proxies were canvassed and stuffed into the box 48 hours prior to the SGM as specified. 

 The anomaly was that the hall was full with no spare chairs available – a random head count by the first plaintiff counted over 130 persons in the hall during the meeting and the voting. The second plaintiff, a reverend member, was surrounded and stifled by unidentified persons in threatening persona, in the likes of deserters of yesteryear. The total membership is in excess of 1,500. 

 The proxies counted were not verified by the membership for transparency. The proxy bearers had vested interest to pass a resolution illegal from the beginning in violation of the Constitution, passed to justify expenditure violating the rules. 

 Many other discrepancies have surfaced; the construction of the new office premises built during 2019 has been done without prior approval of the building and the Nuwara Eliya Municipality has issued a letter dated 2 July 2020 imposing a penalty of Rs. 492,260 for constructing without the approval of the building plan. 

 The expenditure of up to Rs. 40.8 million as per the approval sought retrospectively in the SGM notice has been spent and handled in cash by an outsourced company representative identified as an outside audit firm, owned by a member of the Committee, which is another violation by a committee member benefitting and working with vested interest drawing fees of up to Rs. 150,000 per month from the NEGC. Rumours are rife that even apartments have been built for some prime members of the Committee as part of the expenditure incurred for the new rooms constructed. 

 Sadly, the CID (Criminal Investigation Department) entry made has had neither response nor investigation, with the Nuwara Eliya Police HQI (Headquarters Inspector of Police) seemingly undeterred by a complaint to investigate by a helpless NEGC member. How will justice ever prevail? 

 So, since the majority present assisted the Committee to bulldoze and illegally pass an illegal resolution at an illegal SGM, the NEGC defenders withdrew the case filed, on 22 September 2020 in the DC Nuwara Eliya, reserving the right to file a fresh application as required since the original plaint request was to restrain the SGM from being held and thus avoid the gross violation of giving life to a rule that was already dead. 

 The fact of violating the rule cannot be changed. Justifying the error or disregard of the law may have consequences beyond comprehension to the unsuspecting members of the club. 

 Observation from the SGM shared by Abeywardene 
 
           When the SGM was convened, the President called the meeting to order and requested the Secretary to read the notice of the SGM  
           First plaintiff in the case on behalf of the NEGC defenders, rose on a point of order and claimed that since the AGM held on 15 August 2020 was adjourned abruptly without a date, the life of the Committee had ended on 15 August 2020, which was allowed under special circumstances being published in the newspapers due to the Covid-19 lockdown from March to May 2020. Thus claimed that there is no President and that (Retd.) Maj. Gen. Srinath Rajapakse cannot preside and that the Trustee present Mahanama Perera should preside and take over as legally explained in the letter delivered by courier from Ranjan Gooneratne  
           The Constitution Clause 2(c) specifies that the AGM and election of new office bearers shall be held each year before 30 April of each year. Thus the Committee not elected at the AGM on 15 August 2020, determines that there is no Committee in office after the extended date beyond 30 April of 2020  
           It was also placed before the house that since a case has been filed under SPL/302/20 seeking the restraining of holding the SGM has been fixed for notice of action on 15 October 2020, it would be “sub judice” to discuss  matters before the court openly  
           The President occupying the chair despite objections from the floor, invited Mangala Niyarepola introduced as the attorney representing the NEGC and Committee to respond  
           Mangala Niyarepola cited rule 41 to be read with Clause 2(e), and misled the members present in to believing that the SGM is legal and that the majority of the members present and the proxies from members not present are enough to give the Committee the mandate to approve retrospectively cash spent prior to obtaining approval from the membership at an SGM  
           Another member from the floor responding stated that rule 41 can be visited only if the rules are silent on a matter, but in this case the rule was clear that Clause 2(e) was violated by the Committee spending nearly Rs. 40 million without holding an SGM prior to spending  
           Other member attorneys supporting the Committee spoke in favour of approving funds retrospectively, stating that the Committee has by oversight not obtained approval and now it should be resolved without going to court  
           A counter response made was that the doubts and controversy that there has been misappropriation of funds due to vastness of the sums involved without obtaining approval and as such doubts of the integrity of the transaction will always be unanswered  
           The consensus suggested amidst cross talk and arguments was that an independent audit to investigate into the construction of the new rooms and the expenditure incurred should be done independent of the committee members  
           The overwhelming atmosphere that prevailed to bulldoze the irregular resolution was passed by the house. The President continuing in the chair announced that there were 96 members present and that 76 voted for, with nine voting against and three abstaining. 316 proxies for and one proxy against was announced by the Chair

,,The little stars of Little Miss Puppet,tabloids,"Rookada Panchi (Little Miss Puppet), currently on theatres, is a musical family entertainer. It is a Sinhala movie with English subtitles. The movie is produced by veteran lyricist Kularatne Ariyawansa and directed by Kalpana Ariyawansa and Vindana Ariyawansa. Lyrics and music of the movie are by Dr. Rohana Weerasinghe. The main characters of the movie are played by Kushenya Fonseka (Rangi), Lakshika Deshan (Sasa), Jackson Anthony (Uncle Louis), Niroshan Wijesinghe (Rangi’s father), Dilhani Ekanayake (Rangi’s mother), Dhananjaya Siriwardena (Uncle), Umali Thilakarathne (Auntie), and Dayadeva Edirisinghe (Walter).

The story revolves around a young girl – Rangi – who is worried about her mother’s sudden illness. She and her brother find comfort at a beach carnival’s puppet show run by a mysterious ringmaster – Uncle Louis – while they were away from their home with their Uncle and Auntie. The two main characters played by Kushenya and Lakshitha are phenomenal, especially the excellence Kushenya portrays in handling puppets and the brotherly love extended to her by Lakshitha as Sasa. Lakshika and Kushenya shared their experiences of Little Miss Puppet with Little Stars during the premiere of the show held at Regal Cinema.

 Kushenya  

Kushenya Sayumi Fonseka is a Grade Nine student of Buddhist Ladies’ College, Colombo and is passionate about becoming a dancer. Little Miss Puppet is her second movie experience.

 Kushenya, tell us about yourself.  

I am a student of Buddhist Ladies’ College and I am currently studying in Grade Nine. I changed schools in Grade Six, from St. Paul’s Girls’ School, Kelaniya. I am an only child and I live in Kelaniya. I play badminton. My favourite subject in school is dancing and I love to learn different styles and movements in dancing.

 What is your favourite style of dancing?  

I have been studying different styles of dance under the supervision of veteran artiste Channa Wijewardena since I was seven years old. My favourite style is the Kandyan dancing.

 How did you become an actress?  

I have been in television commercials when I was very young. Then, I received an opportunity to play the daughter’s role in the movie  Dakala Purudu Kenek  (The Strange Familiar). I was invited to audition for Little Miss Puppet as one of the directors saw my photos on social media posted by my Aunt Samanalee Fonseka. Those pictures were captured by my grandfather.

 

 How did you feel when you were told about your character in Little Miss Puppet?  

I felt really happy. I’ve loved puppets from a very young age, and I loved the character when I heard about the story. Rangi is a very strong girl. I learnt a lot of new things acting in the movie.

 How was your commitment to the movie, being the main character? 

It wasn’t tiring. I loved the experience. It was fun to work with Uncle Kalpana and Uncle Vindana. They weren’t ordering us around as most adults do. They were like children, playing with us and laughing without teaching us what do to make the character look better. Uncle Jackson Anthony also helped us a lot, teaching us a lot of things on puppets.

 How did you learn to work with puppets?  

As I said, Uncle Jackson taught me a lot about puppets. We watched many videos of Darci Lynne on America’s Got Talent. Watching Darcy’s videos helped me a lot. Watching Sesame Street was also very helpful.

 Do you like to watch movies?  

Yes, a lot! My favourite movies are Frozen, Toy Story, How to Train Your Dragon, and Woody Woodpecker. My favourite character among them is Elsa of Frozen. She is the strongest girl I have come across in a story.

 How was your experience working with Sasa, your brother in the movie? 

It was super easy to work with him. He was sweet and by the end of filming, we felt like we were real brother and sister. We were even getting into small fights by the end of filming (chuckles!).

 Whom do you want to thank?  

I want to extend a very big thank you to my mother, father, and my Aunt Samanalee Fonseka. I also want to thank Uncles Kalpana and Vindana Ariyawansa for the immense support they have given me. And then to my family and friends in and outside the film set.

 

 Lakshika  

Lakshika Deshan Herath plays Sasa in Little Miss Puppet. He studies in Grade Five and attends Parakrama Primary School, Rambukkana. He is getting ready to sit for the Grade Five Scholarship exam this year.

 Tell us more about yourself, Lakshika.  

I am currently working very hard on improving myself to sit for the scholarship exam. I dream to get admission to a better school. I have a younger brother and an older brother. We live in Rambukkana. Apart from my interest in acting, I am also interested in karate, volleyball, singing, and music. During the Covid-19 break, I also wrote a book titled  Lovak Handava Loka Balavatha Vu Corona Virus.  I sent this to the “ Ratak Watina Pothak ” competition organised by the Department of Education. I have participated and won many karate competitions including district and zonal-level ones – I have two gold medals.

 How were you selected for the role of Sasa?  

Some time back, I took part in a talent competition organised by one of the largest media networks in the country and I became one of the 12 finalists. I was imitating many famous characters like  “Korale Mahaththaya”, “Jasaya”, “Ehelepola Nilame”  and a bookworm. Mr. Jackson Anthony had noticed my talent in this programme and has proposed me for auditions for Sasa. Then I got through the auditions and was selected for the character.

 Where did you learn to imitate these characters? 

I didn’t go for any classes, if that is what you mean. I learnt all these by watching television and reading about them.

 How did you feel about the character Sasa?  

I was surprised to hear from him. I felt as if Sasa is me.

 How was your experience with Rangi, your sister in the set?  

She was extremely lovable. She helped me to adapt to the character well. We became the best of friends at the end.

 Didn’t you feel scared to play one of the main characters in a movie?  

No, not at all. Director Uncles Kalapna and Vindana Ariyawansa help me a lot to adapt to the character. They didn’t impose any rules; they instructed me to be free and do as I like. I was very happy to be a part of this team.

 Do you plan to study acting further?  

I like to study drama. But now I am dreaming of studying science in a big new school.

 Who are your supporters?  

I want to thank my family. They were with me always. I want to thank Mr. Jackson Anthony. Without him, I would have never received this opportunity. I also want to thank Mr. Kalpana and Mr. Vindana Ariyawansa for the opportunity they gave me and for readily supporting me.",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,The little stars of Little Miss Puppet,tabloids,0,1602357298,0,100568,,

,,Bracing ourselves,brunch,"The newly rising Covid-19 cases and what it means for us on an emotional level  
 
 By Naveed Rozais 

 Here we are, as Sri Lankans, watching a second outbreak of Covid-19 taking place, with the first new case of community-bound Covid-19 being reported last Sunday (4), and a total of over 1,000 cases, and counting, being reported within the following 72-hour period (as of 7 October). Our sense of security, some say complacency, has been shattered. Covid-19 is here again, within our community, and only time will tell how severe this outbreak will be.  

 The economic implications of a second Covid-19 outbreak and a second lockdown are clear. It would not be good. The first lockdown saw Sri Lanka’s three biggest industries, the tourism industry, the migrant worker industry, and the apparel industry take severe hits, along with almost every other industry beginning to suffer. The tourism industry has seen things get bleaker with foreign travel to our shores being completely halted, with no hope of resuming until, at absolute earliest, early-2021, if not later.  

 But what does this mean emotionally for us as a people?   

The first lockdown and our mental state 

 The first lockdown was a mixed bag. For some, it was time to slow down and be mindful. For others, it was a time of great scarcity and strain, with loss of income, restricted movement, and mounting uncertainty.  

 Self-care became important during the first lockdown; dialogues around wellness and mental health increased, as did awareness on the importance of mental health. But what was our mental health like during the first lockdown?  

 We reached out to National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Senior Consultant Psychiatrist Dr. Pushpa Ranasinghe, for her insight on what general mental health was like during the last lockdown.  

 Dr. Ranasinghe shared that the NIMH’s mental health helpline, 1926, received approximately 15,000 calls during the lockdown, receiving more than 150 calls each day, with a drop rate of 200 calls. Dr. Ranasinghe also shared that there was an increased incidence of suicide during the lockdown.  

 “In the beginning, the majority of calls we received were about anxiety, from general anxiety about the situation to anxiety from those with pre-existing mental health conditions treating their illness during the lockdown,” Dr. Ranasinghe shared, adding that as the lockdown went on, the nature of issues reported changed. “It became about economic issues, domestic violence, alcohol problems, and then child-related issues like education. We had both men and women calling us in equal amounts for support.”  

 Dr. Ranasinghe shared that many people with pre-existing mental health conditions were unable to access mental health services and treatment, including medication, because of the lockdown. The NIMH stepped in, working with local mental health teams and post offices to be able to deliver medication to those in need.  

 From an NIMH standpoint, Dr. Ranasinghe shared that NIMH has prepared for a potential second lockdown, reviving procedures and systems they used in the first lockdown, giving accommodation to some staff so that they don’t need to travel and potentially expose themselves, as well as following all health guidelines. 

 What can we expect to feel in a (potential) second lockdown?  

 Speaking on a potential second lockdown, Dr. Ranasinghe commented that a second lockdown, while easier to manage on a practical and logistical level, would still definitely be a very difficult time. “People who are in tourism are hit the most, and so are the children in school and doing exams; not to mention those working abroad, stuck there with their relatives in Sri Lanka. Anxiety will definitely go up,” Dr. Ranasinghe said, adding: “With the previous lockdown, we had hope that we were coming out (of it). This time, with the fear of community spread, the anxiety will likely be much more. There are also people who are fed up, and those who are in very difficult situations feel it would just be better to catch it and die if that’s the case.”  

 Counselling psychologist and psychotherapist Nivendra Uduman shared his views on what to expect emotionally from a second lockdown, explaining that the most likely emotion that Sri Lankans will experience will be anxiety. For adults, financial situations and job security will be a source of anxiety, while young people will struggle because of shifts in routine. Uduman also commented that some teenagers and young people will be vulnerable to developing depression in a second lockdown, especially because this lockdown would be coming at a time when schools have just reopened, and routines are just going back to normal.  

 On coming to terms with a second lockdown, Uduman stressed that it was important for people to be mindful of what is happening. “People need to really understand what they can and can’t control in a situation like this.”  

 Furthermore, he noted: “Things that can be controlled include looking after yourself and your loved ones, as well as practising self-care and keeping active by exercise or pursuing a hobby. If there is a second lockdown, then government regulations will be released to help understand what you can and can’t control.”  

 Pressing pause on life, as many did during the first lockdown, seems very difficult, and Uduman shared that this will depend very much on the person. “Some people are very content with shutting down and stepping back,” Uduman said, adding: “But other people need to be on the move and be active. We also need to remember that not every home is safe and comfortable, so that challenge is also there. The risks and issues of intimate partner violence and being unsafe will also come up again if there is a prolonged curfew.”   

 The very real issue of stigma 

With the nature of Covid-19 and its rate of infection, it is easy to blame or ostracise those who contract it. But, it is very important to remember that crises are survived by working together and not by turning on each other. Stigmatising Covid-19 and those who get it can contribute to making the virus more likely to spread, resulting in a bigger and potentially uncontrollable outbreak. Stigma can lead those with potential symptoms to do things like hide their symptoms and not seek out healthcare immediately.  

 Particularly in the case of a second lockdown, where we will all be more stressed, it is more important than ever to be kind. Actively work against perpetuating negative stereotypes and assumptions. Be extra careful of what information you share and with whom. Don’t strengthen false associations between the disease and other factors, don’t create widespread fear, and don’t dehumanise those who have the disease. 

 A second outbreak, though discouraging, does not mean that we have failed, and those of us who have got Covid-19, have not done so wilfully. Covid-19 is at the end of the day, a disease. Now, more than any other time, is to band together and be mindful of precautions and guidelines, and for each of us to do our part, individually and collectively, to fight this outbreak.  

 Our resilience is real 

 Sri Lanka’s biggest strength is its people, and it is our people, working together and being kind that will get us through this difficult time.  

 Sri Lanka is resilient beyond belief. We have suffered through so many times of trauma and come out stronger. From our decades-long civil war to the tsunami to the Easter attacks, we have always defeated what has been thrown at us. 

 Sri Lanka has always been a collective society. We’ve always thought about ourselves as a whole, and this is what will get us through; not just Covid-19, but any other crisis that comes our way. We’ve seen our country’s spirit of togetherness rise to the occasion time and time again.  

 While this second outbreak is a setback, it is just that; a setback. We will persevere and we will recover. And we will do it as we have always done. Together. ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Bracing ourselves,brunch,0,1602367248,0,100573,,
,,Mirisata: Bringing Sri Lankan spice to Portland,brunch,"A look at the vegan Sri Lanka restaurant making waves in Portland, Oregon  
 
By Naveed Rozais 

 Last weekend saw the opening of Mirisata, a landmark restaurant in Portland, Oregon. Mirisata is a vegan Sri Lankan restaurant, the first Sri Lankan restaurant in Portland, and the first vegan restaurant in the world to serve exclusively Sri Lankan cuisine.  

A worker-owned business, Mirisata is a three-person team consisting of Alex, Simar, and Rochelle.    The Sunday Morning Brunch    sat down with Mirisata mastermind and co-owner Alex for a look at this groundbreaking restaurant and how it came to be.  

 What’s the Mirisata origin story? How did it come to be?  

 Growing up in California, my dad, who is Sri Lankan, would cook Sri Lankan food very frequently. Growing up in the US as a first-generation immigrant, I didn’t feel a connection to Sri Lankan culture in many ways, besides the food. I started cooking my dad’s recipes when I moved away from home and went to college; as well as visiting Sri Lankan restaurants in the US, and learning more about Sri Lankan cuisine in general.  

 I’ve been vegan for 17 years, and I started veganising favourite Sri Lankan recipes like my dad’s chicken curry using vegan meat substitutes. There are many types of vegan chicken in the US; for curry, you need something that will keep its shape after being cooked in the pot for a long time. I used to cook rice and curry for my friends a lot and was frequently told I should start a restaurant.  

I’m not a chef and I have no commercial cooking experience. I was a freelance journalist and then worked in communications with nonprofits. I decided to do a popup, and I found a vegan chef, Simar, who’d been working for over 10 years in commercial kitchens. We had our first popup in March before the Covid-19 outbreak where we served 65 people a formal, sit-down dinner. Simar lost his job during the pandemic, and we had extra time on our hands and decided to start another popup for takeout alone.  

 We found this little place that was willing to give us a low price and let us pay our security deposit over time, and we started the popup with $ 600, our own money, which is very low for start-ups in the US. We then had Rochelle join the team and deceived to make Mirisata more than a popup. We opened last weekend, and are now open four days week from Thursday to Sunday.  

 To design the logo, we commissioned our friend Suprabha Irugalratne, a vegan activist and illustrator from Kandy. Our logo isn't actually a chicken – it's the Sri Lankan jungle fowl, which is the national bird of Sri Lanka. Of all the amazing animals in the country, this one has special significance for a vegan restaurant. There are four jungle fowl species in the world and, while the other three were domesticated to become chickens, the Sri Lankan jungle fowl resisted attempts at domestication and is still only found living free in the wild. 

 Mirisata is a worker-owned business. What led to doing business this way?  

 In a worker-owned business, or a worker co-operative, the people who are working in the business have part ownership in the business as well. Simar, Rochelle, and I have equal ownership of Mirisata. 

 Working this way, for me, is a values thing. I don’t want to be anyone’s boss. I want to be their partner. People shouldn’t be working for just a wage or an hourly rate. If the company is doing well and eventually there are profits, I don’t see why the people who worked so hard to make those profits happen shouldn’t be able to share in those profits. Labour is what creates profit and that profit should be shared.  

Mirisata is expanding and we are growing the team. When someone comes in brand new, they won’t immediately become an owner. There will be a trial period where we see how they fit and the value they bring to the business and how they can help it grow before we make them part owners.  

 Workers co-ops are popular around the world but not in the restaurant industry. There are several worker co-op supermarkets and other companies in the US and it’s also a form of business catching on in Europe. The multibillion-dollar Spanish company Mondragon is owned by its employees.  

 Is being vegan a challenge when it comes to creating authentic Sri Lankan cuisine? 

 Sri Lankan food is actually one of the most vegan-friendly cuisines in the world. You really only need to look out for a few things like Maldive fish in your pol symbol or seeni sambol and make small adjustments like that to keep things vegan-friendly. Other than that, it’s very obvious when a Sri Lankan dish is meat-based.  

  I’ve also been vegan for over 17 years, and have tried cooking with different types of vegan meats. It’s not very limiting. The biggest limitation is seafood. For example, you can’t make a crab curry because you can’t fake a whole crab or crab body parts. There is vegan shrimp which we use in our prawn vade. There isn’t really a great substitute for fish and crab yet, but we’re trying things out.  

 We’ve made vegan egg hoppers using a mung-based egg substitute and we’re introducing these egg hoppers as a brunch item on Sundays. We’re very excited about it as it will be the first time we introduce the egg hopper to our customers.  

 What’s the food scene like in Portland and where does Mirisata fit in?  

Portland is a very vegan-friendly city in that respect; it’s like other vegan-friendly cities like London and Barcelona, except that it is a much smaller city. Being a vegan restaurant, we’re definitely in the right place.  

 Indian food is popular in Portland where there are some vegan and vegetarian Indian restaurants. We try to emphasise how different Sri Lankan food is from Indian food, although we do realise that there is some overlap, like the Sri Lankan fried rice being close to the Indian biriyani and similar. We try to stay away from that and give people a unique experience, with food like hoppers and string hoppers. Most Indian restaurants in the city offer North Indian cuisine, so you can’t get food like ours anywhere else in town.  

 The vast majority of our customers have never tried Sri Lankan food before and they love it. Mirisata also provides Sri Lankans in the area with a taste of home. There are no Sri Lankan restaurants in Portland, although we have a big Sri Lankan population in nearby Hillsboro. There is one company that does catering for events, but that’s about it.  

 I actually reached out to the Sri Lankan community in the area when starting out with Mirisata to see if any one of them would like to be involved, but it didn’t pan out. The community here have intensive jobs with bigger companies, so managing time can be difficult.  

 How has the pandemic affected Portland’s food scene? 

With Mirisata, international travel being super restricted has been driving people to try new cuisines, because the next best thing to travelling is trying out a new cuisine at home.  

 There have been a lot of restaurants that have closed down, unfortunately. There were two types of restaurants that were impacted the most – the very large restaurants with big dining spaces and high rents are suffering because people don’t feel safe eating out in large settings anymore, and the downtown places too have been suffering because everyone’s working from home and the workday lunch is what they depend on.  

 There have also been people who have done very well, especially the people who had takeout and delivery as part of their sales.  

 In Mirisata’s case, we have a small indoor dining room which is currently closed that can accommodate about 16 people and an outdoor area that can accommodate between 24 and 30 people. More people like eating outdoors than in, and we have lots of space in the front that we can use for that. There are small improvements that need to be made, and we need to build a deck as well for added seating, which we will slowly do over time.  

 What’s the long-term Mirisata vision? 

 Eventually, once Covid-19 passes, we’d like to have a nice dine-in restaurant where we serve rice and curry family style. At the moment, it’s mostly takeout, which is fine given the time and also since rice and curry is something that can easily be served takeout style. But we do love the presentation of rice and curry served family style with bowls of curries on the table and people connecting over their food.  

 We’re expanding our menu, adding the egg hopper for brunch on Sundays, as well as honey hoppers, and we’re also introducing vegan beef rolls which we’ve been working on for a while. We’re also getting a beer and wine license and hoping to get in Lion Stout and make it available at Mirisata. It isn’t available anywhere else in the US, so we’re pretty excited about it.  ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Mirisata: Bringing Sri Lankan spice to Portland,brunch,0,1602367209,0,100574,,
,,Creating a new platform to seek mental health support,brunch,"Airtel and NIMH launch text-based mental health helpline  
 
 By Naveed Rozais 

 The increasing popularity in the dialogue on mental health indicates that more people are seeking help and support than ever before. That being said, there is still so much to be done with regard to de-stigmatising mental health and mental illness in Sri Lanka. The most important of these is the creation of safe environments for people to open up about their emotions and struggles which affect their mental wellbeing. 

 A landmark achievement has been made on this front with Airtel Lanka and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) launching a new text-based helpline that will allow people to seek mental health support and intervention over SMS. 

 The “1926” chatline, launched at a private event followed by a panel discussion on raising awareness about the helpline and encouraging its usage among the youths (even those who do not have a pre-diagnosed condition), went live yesterday (10). 

The panel discussion was moderated by mental health advocate and digital content creator Shanuki De Alwis and included NIMH senior consultant psychiatrist Dr. Pushpa Ranasinghe, counselling psychologist and psychotherapist Nivendra Uduman, Airtel Lanka Head of Human Resources Kanishka Ranaweera, and Airtel Lanka Chief Executive Officer (CEO)/Managing Director (MD) Ashish Chandra. 

 Importance of text-based helpline for today’s youths 

 Dr. Ranasinghe shared that despite reduced suicide rates over the last 20 years, mental health is still a key issue in Sri Lanka. From a societal point of view, there is much to be done regarding increasing empathy as well as fixing stigma and social norms. 

 Another gap is in professional, co-ordinated services – something the NIMH is able to help with, given their reach and infrastructure across the island. The NIMH has a mental team in each district and is connected to the national emergency helpline 119 as well, giving them the capacity to launch a co-ordinated response to support anyone in need of mental health intervention. 

 The 1926 chatline is geared towards younger people. “(The use of) mobile phones and text messaging in particular have rapidly become the preferred communication tools among the youths, creating a culture connected to their phones. As healthcare professionals, our dependency on technology is now more important than ever before. As a result of its advancements, we must find improved ways of being accessible to those who need help. We are thankful to Airtel for helping us evolve 1926 from a voice-based helpline to a text-based helpline,” Dr. Ranasinghe said. 

 How the 1926 chatline works 

 Using the helpline is very simply where all someone looking for mental health support needs to do is send a text to 1926, after which the user will be connected to professional counsellors who can provide support and counselling via a text message in English, Sinhala, or Tamil. 

 The 1926 text-based helpline hopes to encourage more young people to reach out to professionals, particularly when they are experiencing times of crisis and may require guidance in mitigating their mental health concerns in a safe and anonymous environment. 

 Speaking on the launch of the 1926 chatline, Airtel Lanka CEO/MD Chandra explained that digital technologies are transforming learning, socialising, and communication among the youths. 

 “At Airtel, we are always looking at ways to create meaningful connections for our customers by blending technology with human needs, and this is one such initiative. Our brand is heavily engaged with young Sri Lankans and we are very much aware that they prefer to use digital platforms to engage and find solutions,” Chandra said. 

 Airtel Lanka has a network footprint across the island and has emerged as Sri Lanka’s fastest-expanding network, being the fastest operator to reach one million customers in the country following its establishment in 2009. 

 The 1926 chatline launched yesterday (10) to coincide with World Mental Health Day 2020, the theme of which is “Mental Health for All: Greater Investment, Greater Access…Everyone, Everywhere”. The 1926 text service is free for all Airtel users and is also accessible for users of other mobile networks. 

 During the panel discussion, Dr. Ranasinghe further shared that the chatline will be managed by a separate team of over 20 nurses as well as a team of volunteers who will be trained to work with users over text. Replies would be based on urgency, looking at the severity of the messages as well as the history of the user with various levels of responses, including working with the 119 emergency helpline services to dispatch help in the case of emergency or high-risk situations. 

 Keeping the 1926 chatline safe 

 Moreover, Dr. Ranasinghe explained that users are not compelled to share any personal or identification information on the chatline. The only thing the chatline collects is the user’s phone number. 

 “When someone gets in touch with us on the 1926 helpline and they come into the system, their number is registered; from our side, we make a profile with key information like the risks reported (if they’ve been dealing with violence or substance abuse, if they’re at risk of attempting suicide or self-harm, etc.) The next time the person gets in touch with us, the profile pops up to let the counsellor know if they are at high risk. Only the supervisor can see the details of these profiles. Text messages are not recorded; we make our own paper-based records so that we can treat people more effectively.” 

 There are very specific situations. For example, if a child is being abused, there will be a handover of information to another agency for effective action to take place. 

 Creating a safe platform to report mental health issues 

 Counselling psychologist and psychotherapist Nivendra Uduman, speaking during the panel discussion, said that while technology can contribute to mental health issues, it is also very useful as a tool to getting effective mental health support and intervention. Uduman also explained that communicating through words can have a very meaningful impact, as sometimes it is very difficult for someone to physically voice out what they are feeling, adding that this gives the text helpline an edge over phone and in-person counselling, particularly with the youths. 

 Dr. Ranasinghe also commented that the youths have a tendency to be very insular with their mental health issues, with many of our youths not opening up to anyone – even close friends or family – for fear of being vulnerable. A text-based platform makes people like this feel much more comfortable, and communicating via text also makes them feel less vulnerable, especially when they contact the 1926 helpline on separate occasions and are counselled by different people. 

 Uduman commented that the 1926 chatline also gives users the chance to come forward with non-critical mental health issues. “In many cases, symptoms of depression and other mental health issues can be treated long before it comes to (the point of) suicide and self-harm. Youths don't know how to identify it in themselves. 

 “The anonymity of text would make them more comfortable talking about day-to-day things like relationship issues, study-related stress, and family situations. It would be easier for them to discuss these things over text than on the phone or in person. Also, with over-the-phone counselling, questions are often geared towards anxiety and depression. Text would be an easier medium for youths to express themselves, especially because of the perception that call lines are for people in a crisis.” 

 Uduman also said that text-based helplines help overcome issues of privacy because users are able to get help and seek counsel from anywhere and in any situation without needing to worry about being seen or being overheard.

,,Frustrated students and teachers wait for a light at the end of the tunnel,brunch," By Dinithi Gunasekera 

 “When the Covid restrictions were in place earlier in the year, we had lectures through Zoom. Then, we started university on 24 August. We had just started exams the week before last when these new cases were detected. All our exams are postponed yet again. It seems we will be graduating in five years instead of four,” said Anudi Karunanayake, a first-year student at the University of Colombo, in conversation with    The Sunday Morning Brunch   . 

 Things seemed to be slowly but surely drifting back to normal in the island of Sri Lanka, after over a two-month period of islandwide curfew and a few months of adjusting to the “new normal”. However now, the public is yet again left in the lurch after a garment worker in an apparel factory tested positive for the coronavirus at Gampaha Hospital on 3 October, which also led to the detection of the Minuwangoda Covid cluster soon after. 

 As at 10 a.m. on Wednesday (7), the Covid-19-positive cases from the Minuwangoda cluster stood at 832 and curfew was imposed in the Divulapitiya, Minuwangoda, Veyangoda, Gampaha, and a number of other adjacent police divisions until further notice. 

 When will this end? 

 Following the recent developments, schools that were to be closed for holidays following the grade five scholarship examination and Advanced Level (A/L) examination commenced vacation five days prior to the set date. 

 Although many may state that schoolgoers have it easy as the holidays were pre-planned and so it was set to begin either way, the hourly news updates on hundreds of newly confirmed cases suggest otherwise. 

 “Right after quarantine, when we came back to school, we started off where we left off. The newly inducted batch of prefects in our school was determined to get back to work – as we all should be. We had an excellent batch of prefects last year and we noticed how, unfortunately, they were unable to go through with their planned duties to their fullest capacity because of the coronavirus. The goal of our newly inducted guild was to make sure that we covered everything the previous batch couldn't,”   said   Dulandi Gunasekera, a newly inducted prefect at Musaeus College.   

 “We stopped school when we were on the verge of distributing permission slips to start physical meetings and projects at school again. We had a ray of hope that everything will go as planned. But now, the permission slips are in my schoolbag since Friday (2). 

 “The uncertainty is the most daunting thing. The problem is we don’t know how far this would go. We don't know if we would go for another lockdown. We were really hyped up about everything we had planned and now we're not even sure if we can execute it. This whole incident hitting at the peak of everything going back to normal is possibly the worst thing,” explained the forlorn school prefect. 

 Besides the disenchanted feelings and the dashed hopes of school students, we learnt that the teaching staff of schools too are deeply concerned about the foggy path ahead.  

 Prolonged lockdowns and curfews would only mean the continuation or resumption of lessons online via popular online platforms and learning management systems (LMSs) such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Classroom, etc.   

 Did the first lockdown have its benefits? 

 However, one of the very few silver linings of the first wave of Covid-19 was undoubtedly the major developments in the information technology (IT) sector in Sri Lanka, and only a very few would disagree. It can be said that Covid-19 practically forced Sri Lanka to adapt to the functional utilisation of e-learning and work-from-home arrangements, which we’ve been stalling for a much longer time period than we’d like to admit. 

 “The Covid-19 situation changed the lives of students and teachers alike. I am part of a leading private school in Colombo where the school authorities managed to launch online teaching on a regular basis by creating an online teaching platform,” shared Sajeevanie Bandara, a senior teacher and university guidance counsellor from a reputed school in Colombo.  

 “Regardless, many of the schools in the island do not have the same facilities and resources. We as a school successfully ensured the academic progress of the students, and even held online tests for evaluation purposes. It’s true that it wasn’t smooth sailing initially, as all the teachers were not equally competent in using IT for teaching purposes. However, with time and regular training sessions, they became competent. 

 “As an A/L teacher, online teaching during the pandemic situation proved to be very successful as the students are more mature. They even felt quite confident in asking questions verbally and through the chat box. So the school I represent is ready to face any unexpected situation as we successfully handled the first lockdown. However, I understand that it won’t be the same for schools throughout the island.” 

 Sri Lanka, still classified as a developing nation on the world stage, has enough and more reasons to be anxious about the rocky months to come. Despite the plentiful praise and commendations received by reputed international organisations from all across the globe, the country is currently at a stumbling point economically. 

 Exams  

 Another looming fear is the possibility of a further postponement of the already delayed A/L examinations that were originally scheduled to be held in August. 

 The government announced on 7 October that GCE Advanced Level and Grade 5 scholarship examinations will be held as scheduled.  

 “My batch mates and I are fed up.   The constant delaying of the exam is such a burden and an added stress.   I was so fed up that I even went on a trip to Nuwara Eliya with my friends last week. If anyone hears someone from an earlier batch having gone on a trip at the brink of A/L exams, they would have asked if he or she was mad,” shared Liyara Silva, a frustrated A/L student following the local curriculum. 

 In addition to schools, a couple of government universities have also closed while many other neighbouring universities and private institutions have done so unofficially on the basis of keeping its student population safe. 

 Sri Lanka’s state-run universities, reputed for its long-drawn semesters due to reasons varying from sudden student union strikes to political interventions to mere inefficiencies of the system, could potentially inculcate more unrest within the avid young student population as a result of further obstacles to their graduation. 

 “The exams are postponed, but we have lectures, for now. They informed us, strictly, to wear masks within the university premises. The lack of time is what I’m worried about,” commented Anuki Viyathma, a second-year student at the University of Jayewardenepura. 

 The limitations to learning due to the lack of an online platform were yet again highlighted by a number of university students we spoke to. This proved to be particularly challenging for students in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields. 

 “The major problem we are facing currently is connection issues. Luckily, we had our exams in the last three weeks. We haven’t completed the practical units yet. They were planning to carry out face-to-face practical exams, like observing tissues and so on. But yesterday we were informed to prepare presentations on those subjects, which, to be honest, is ineffective,” shared a second-year medical student at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Colombo.  

 Stuck here: The plight of students studying abroad 

 University students either already attending a foreign university or even prospective students in foreign universities who are currently in Sri Lanka are facing major challenges. The visa issuing process, which was by default regulated due to the circumstances in other countries, would be further hindered, while travel restrictions imposed would now be further heightened. 

 Sadhana Ranasinghe, a prospective medical student of a university in Georgia, US, shared her thoughts with us, stating: “At the moment, I’m highly stressed because the university keeps telling us to come there as soon as possible. The Health Ministry of Georgia stresses that doing a medical degree online is not acceptable, which is true. At the moment, the university just announced that they will stop conducting online lectures by 19 October and that we should get there through a chartered flight. If we can't or we aren't willing to come, we are requested to skip this semester, or worse, repeat it all over again next year. 

 “In medicine, there is also a secondary subject called ‘communication skills’ in which we are supposed to go to clinics, visit patients, talk with them, and get the relevant patient history and diagnoses. We were supposed to start communication skills and Georgian language in the first semester.” 

 Think of this as a ‘delay’; focus on mental health 

 Despite all the evident drawbacks the student population is facing, many share the sentiment that the country’s prompt response to adversity is in fact, “the best solution according to the current situation”. 

 The hindrances to conducting lessons are, in a sense, only one side of the coin. A pandemic such as this has more deep-rooted psychological impacts on citizens, even more so in the case of students. In an exchange with senior lecturer in psychology and Open University of Sri Lanka Department of Psychology chartered health psychologist Dr. G.P. Gamage, a number of considerable pointers were unveiled.  

 Dr. Gamage shared that it’s important to have a clear picture of the situation without any misinformation. 

 “Most of the time, it is misinformation that creates a lot of distress. This is particularly important for grade five students who were about to face the exams as these children are 10-11 years old and do not have the level of cognition and emotional maturity of adults. They see their parents in distress and tend to 'mimic' them.” 

 Dr. Gamage advised parents, teachers, and children to minimise their exposure to many different types of media and curtail viewing news items at short intervals, while maintaining calm within the household. “Adults within households can encourage more ‘opportunity’-based discussions with regard to the current situation. You can prepare them for any situation just by engaging them in household chores and showing them that when things are not perfect, there are other options. The main message is to prepare them for eventualities by showing them that the world is not a perfect place, that sometimes we all have to adjust accordingly, and that the outcomes may not even be as negative as they think,” explained Dr. Gamage. 

 “We need to think of the delay as just one occurrence in the whole array of events that will happen. While it will leave a ‘mark’ in the students’ records, what’s important is that this obstacle should not stop them achieving their life goals, as there can be opportunities also hidden in this dark cloud.” 

 Sharing her expertise, Dr. Gamage recommends an activity for A/L students preparing for the upcoming exams and for parents of younger children. 

 “Take a piece of paper, divide it into two halves, and on the right side, write down the things you enjoyed doing during the lockdown period. On the left side, write the things you did not like about the lockdown period that’s now in the past. Compare both sides and try to see that all the experiences are balanced in a certain way with both positive and negative aspects. However, you need to also remember that while we should hold on to the positives and enhance those, we should either convert the negatives also into positive or discard these negative aspects as life experiences we gained.” 

 Talking about mental health amidst the pandemic, Dr. Gamage stated that circumstances in life are always changing – that it is a fact of life. 

 “Maintaining good mental health is all about adjusting to the situations in a healthy manner without resorting to harmful behaviour or negative reactions continuously.” ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Frustrated students and teachers wait for a light at the end of the tunnel,brunch,0,1602366349,0,100585,,

,,Railways to transport commodities,news,"By Sarah Hannan 

The Ministry of Agriculture has decided that it would reconsider using the railway system to transport goods between cities from January 2021 onwards.

Minister of Agriculture Mahindananda Aluthgamage on Thursday (8) called on State Ministers Mohan Priyadarshana De Silva and Jayantha Samaraweera, Agriculture Ministry Secretary, Ceylon Fertiliser Company Chairman, Railways General Manager, Ports Authority Chairman, and other officials to discuss the feasibility of using train services to transport agrarian products, fisheries crops, export crops, fuel, and fertiliser once again.

“Fifty years ago, the country’s train service was widely used to transport goods from sea ports to the areas across the country. With the increasing costs of transporting goods via the road and highway network, mounting waste, increasing traffic congestion, and pollution, we have decided to once again switch to using trains to transport goods across the country,” Aluthgamage revealed.

In order to facilitate the transportation of fisheries crops, the Ministry is discussing the possibility of setting up freezer facilities in rail carriages.

The idea to use trains for transporting commodity items came about when ministry officials were deliberating over the proposal to commence the transportation of fertiliser from the Ports of Trincomalee and Colombo to the rest of the country.

Government fertiliser companies spend Rs. 650 million a year to transport fertilisers. Once the mode of transportation switches to railways, the cost can be brought down by at least 50%, it is believed.

Meanwhile, arrangements are to be made in January 2021 to transport vegetable and fruit products as well as commodities such as tea from the northern, southern, and central regions of the country to urban areas.",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Railways to transport commodities,news,0,1602365356,0,100613,,
,,LNG power plants | Vast area for exploration,focus,"By Maheesha Mudugamuwa 

 The topics of renewable energy and LNG (liquefied natural gas) have resurfaced in the news yet again, with Minister of Power Dullas Alahapperuma recently stating that two LNG power plants will be constructed by the year 2023 as a solution to the prevailing power crisis in the country in the future. 

 He said that although discussions have been going on since 2007, not a single LNG plant has been built during the past 13 years. The proposed LNG power plants have also been mentioned in the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB)’s Long-Term Generation Expansion Plans prepared annually since 2015. 

 Nevertheless, so far, only one LNG power plant – the Kerawalapitiya LNG power plant with a capacity of 300 MW – has been awarded by the CEB, of which the construction is yet to commence. 

 In January this year, the Cabinet of Ministers approved a 300 MW LNG plant to be built in Kerawalapitiya as a joint venture between the CEB, Japan, and India, with the financial support given from Asian Development Bank (ADB). Along with this, the approved coal power plant with a capacity of 600 MW was also approved as an extension to an existing complex in the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant (Lakvijaya Power Station), partly in order to solve the looming power crisis and mainly to reduce the losses incurred by the CEB as a result of purchasing and generating high-cost diesel electricity. 

 According to the US Energy Information and Administration (EIA), LNG is natural gas that has been cooled to a liquid state (liquefied) – at about -260° Fahrenheit – for shipping and storage purposes. The volume of natural gas in its liquid state is about 600 times smaller than its volume in its gaseous state in a natural gas pipeline. This liquefaction process, developed in the 19th Century, makes it possible to transport natural gas to places natural gas pipelines do not reach, and also to use natural gas as a transportation fuel. 

 Oil and gas exploration 

 With plans underway to build more LNG power plants in the country, the CEB also sought the possibility of introducing indigenous natural gas in the Mannar Basin, although the determination of the quantity and the appropriate price are still to be validated. 

 Reportedly, oil and gas exploration was recommenced last year after three years of waiting, and the Petroleum Resources Development Secretariat (PRDS) reopened the ex-Cairn M2 block in the Mannar Basin for development and commercialisation through a limited tender offer. 

 As of last year, Sri Lanka had received three proposals from two consortiums and an operator based in the UK, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. 

 Speaking to    The Sunday Morning    in earlier September, former Minister of Petroleum Resources Development Chandima Weerakkody lamented that his successors had abandoned his project and as a result, the whole process was delayed by over two years. 

 “Earlier, the Secretariat (PRDS) had planned to have gas production by 2023 with the existing developments of the M2 block for which we have already advertised. Then we need Total (a French oil and gas company) and Equinor (a Norwegian petroleum refining company) to interpret the existing data from JS5 and JS6 blocks in eastern Sri Lanka basin and then to decide on future steps,” he said. 

 As explained by Minister of Energy Udaya Gammanpila, a decision has also been taken by the Government to recommence oil and gas exploration as well as to attract more investors to the industry.   He said the country has already prepared a natural gas policy to attract more investors to explore oil and gas in Sri Lanka. 

 Moreover, due consideration was given to the availability of natural gas in the Mannar Basin and the utilisation of natural gas as a fuel option for the power sector. The discovery of natural gas resources is still at an early stage in the Mannar Basin. However, it is learnt that high priority for local natural gas utilisation will be given when the price is competitive with foreign markets. 

 The development of natural gas power plants is linked with the development of necessary natural gas infrastructure to import LNG. However, the LNG import contracts are governed by “take or pay” restrictions. In addition, having a proper mix of long-term, spot, and short-term contracts for the varied demand according to the weather patterns and seasonal aspects related to ore projects should also be considered. The total present value of implementing the Base Case Plan 2020-2039 in the next 20 years is approximately $ 16,675 million, with a discount rate of 10%. 

 Until local gas production begins, the CEB is to call for tenders for the LNG supply next month, parallel to the construction of the power plant. Apart from the already awarded LNG tender to Lakdhanavi Ltd., the CEB is to call for tenders for the construction of the second LNG power plant in Kerawalapitiya next month. 

 Ground work yet to begin 

 When contacted by    The Sunday Morning   , a spokesman for LTL Holdings (Pvt.) Ltd. said the power purchasing agreement between Lakdhanavi and the CEB is yet to be signed, adding that once the agreements are finalised, the construction of the LNG power plant would begin. 

 The power purchasing agreement at present is at the Attorney General’s (AG) Department, he said. 

 Meanwhile, as learnt by    The Sunday Morning   , negotiations between Sri Lanka and India for the construction of a 300 MW of LNG power plant is at a standstill, as the new Government is yet to take a decision on whether or not to continue with it. 

 A well-informed source attached to the Ministry of Power said that several rounds of discussions took place between the two parties under the previous Government, but the new Government is yet to give its consent to the agreements reached between the two parties. 

 “India was keen on funding a LNG power plant of around 500 MW, but under the CEB Long-Term Energy Generation Plan, the system could accommodate only another 300 MW and therefore, several rounds of discussions were held,” the source said, adding that at present, negotiations are at a standstill as the CEB has decided to go on project tendering. 

 When contacted by    The Sunday Morning   , CEB Chairman Eng. Vijitha Herath said that negotiations had not yet begun under the new Government and the CEB is fully focused on the tendering processes. 

 However, yet, the unsolicited proposals (such as government-to-government) will be considered in the future if there is a request, he said. 

 Already delayed 

 As explained in CEB’s Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan, LNG-fired combined cycle power plants and associated LNG import infrastructure – 2 x 300 MW dual fuel combined cycle power plants – must be commissioned in the western region by 2022. The associated LNG importing infrastructure is to be developed on a fast track process with sufficient capacity to cater to both the new power plants and the conversion of other oil-fired combined cycle power plants in the western region. Furthermore, an additional 3 x 300 MW natural gas combined cycle power plants are expected to be commissioned by 2026 in either Kerawalapitiya or Hambantota. 

 Minister Alahapperuma had stated at a meeting held at the CEB last week that during the last five years, only 300 MW were added to the national grid, although the demand for electricity is growing at 6% a year. 

 He had said that to address the potential power crisis in the future, in line with the President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s “Vision for Prosperity” policy statement, the contribution of green and renewable energy to the country's power grid should be increased to 70% by 2030. 

 In this regard, CEB Chairman Eng. Herath said the construction of the already tendered LNG power plant would commence next month. 

 It is further learnt that the CEB is incurring a loss of around Rs. 250 million per day due to the higher electricity production cost while the annual loss of the CEB is at around Rs. 85 billion. 

 As explained by Eng. Herath, the CEB incurs losses as it sells a unit at around Rs. 16, while the production cost is at around Rs. 23.   To reduce these losses, the CEB should go for low-cost electricity, the Chairman added. 

 “We are finalising the LNG projects and several other low-cost electricity projects. Unless we commence such projects, the losses incurred by the CEB cannot be reduced,” he stressed. 

 Furthermore, the CEB Chairman said the reason for the delay in commencing the construction of low-cost power plants was the delay in procurement processes, adding that given the present documentation speed, it would take another year to finalise the construction of the power plants. 

 Accordingly, the incorporation of LNG-fired power plants to the Sri Lankan power system has been considered in the Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan 2015-2034. 

 In preparation of the Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan 2020-2039, the present trend of LNG fuel prices was considered with the possibility of recovering the capital cost of LNG infrastructure. The option of adopting a floating storage regasification unit (FSRU) as an immediate requirement, along with the possibility of a land-based LNG terminal as a long-term solution, is considered. 

 However, LNG infrastructure must be established at least by 2021 in order to gain the maximum benefit of avoiding high-cost fuel oil. The combined cycle plants that are operating using oil in the western region will be converted to natural gas immediately after the facility is made available. The delays in procuring LNG infrastructure will cause the power plants to operate on oil, which would result in an enormous cost overrun and increased environmental emissions, the CEB plan explains. 

 The main load centre of Sri Lanka is also located in the western region. In order to minimise the transmission losses, the development of power plants closer to the load centre is identified. Therefore, the development of natural gas-operated power plants in the western region is identified as a priority, which will comply with the environmental requirements in the western region. Meanwhile, Hambantota is identified as the second location to develop natural gas power plants with its available port facilities. 

 Meanwhile, Minister Alahapperuma said in Parliament on Thursday (8) that the CEB has incurred a loss of Rs. 181.5 billion between 2015 and 2019. Accordingly, the CEB has incurred a loss of Rs. 2.3 billion in 2015, Rs. 14.4 billion in 2016, Rs. 47.5 billion in 2017, Rs. 31.9 billion in 2018, and Rs. 85.4 billion in 2019. 

 The factors for the losses, as explained by Alahapperuma, included the inability of the previous governments to build new power plants during the past few years and also the failure to amend the electricity tariffs in line with the increased cost of generation.

,,Covid-19 infects 20A,news," 
           SC concludes hearing petitions; observation to Prez and Speaker  
           NFF and Wijeyadasa warn against 20A; MR responds  
           MS’ security and part of premises to be slashed  
           Opposition Leader seeks more security following attack  
 
 The build-up to the proposed 20th Amendment Bill, which has been gathering much attention during the past few weeks, was suddenly put on the backburner last week with the re-emergence of a Covid-19 cluster in Minuwangoda. 

 The detection of a Covid-19-positive patient from the Brandix factory in Minuwangoda opened what seems like a Pandora’s box, with a sudden increase in the number of Covid-19 individuals rising above 1,000 within a matter of three days. 

However, while the first Covid-19 detection was made last Sunday (4), the Supreme Court (SC) concluded the consideration of petitions filed challenging the draft bill of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution on Monday (5). 

 The decision of the court will be sent to the President and Speaker of Parliament in due course, once a determination has been made. Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya stated in open court that the secret decision of the SC regarding the constitutionality of the draft 20th Amendment will be referred to the President and Speaker of Parliament, in accordance with the Constitution. 

 During the hearing, Attorney General (AG) Dappula de Livera stated that all the provisions contained in the draft 20th Amendment were in accordance with the Constitution. 

 Pointing out that the President is bound to ensure free and fair elections in accordance with the Constitution, the AG stated that the proposed 20th Amendment Bill had expanded that responsibility while providing the Election Commission (EC) with a strong legal basis for free and fair elections. 

 The AG explained that the 20th Amendment proposes to reinstate the President’s immunity taken from him by the 19th Amendment, which will enable the President to exercise the executive powers vested in him by the Constitution without any hindrance. 

 He further emphasised that there was no need for a referendum to approve any of the provisions contained in the draft. In conclusion, AG de Livera stressed in court that the draft could easily be passed by a two-thirds majority in Parliament without a referendum. 

 In addition, AG de Livera refused to give a copy of his written submissions to counsel for the petitioners, when said counsel made an application for it to enable them to respond to the Government’s positions. 

 Chief Justice Jayasuriya asked the AG whether he could make it available for them even as an electronic copy. The AG refused the request of the Chief Justice. The AG informed Chief Justice Jayasuriya that he would only be giving the electronic or “soft” copy to the court on Tuesday (6). 

 Ultimately, the court dealt with the AG’s obstructions by making one of its own copies available for the petitioners’ counsel to photocopy and peruse. 

 Subsequently, the court directed the parties involved in the case to submit their written submissions, if any, before 3 p.m. on Tuesday, giving petitioners’ counsel mere hours to obtain, photocopy, read, and file objections against several hundred pages of legal arguments by the AG. 

 Consideration of the petitions commenced for the fourth and final day on Friday (9) morning before the five-member judge bench chaired by Chief Justice Jayasuriya. The bench consisted of SC Justices Buwaneka Aluwihare, Sisira de Abrew, Priyantha Jayawardena, and Vijith Malalgoda. 

 Thirty-nine petitions in total were filed against the draft bill of the 20th Amendment, citing the AG as the respondent. 

 The petitions were put forward by EC member Prof. Ratnajeevan Hoole, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), United National Party (UNP) General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, UNP Deputy Leader Ruwan Wijewardene, SJB Youth Wing Chairman Mayantha Dissanayake, Attorney-at-Law P. Liyanaarachchi of the Sirilaka Janatha Peramuna, Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL), former Governor and Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) Executive Director Ranjith Keerthi Tennakoon, human rights activist Abdul Zanoon, and many others. 

 Meanwhile, Ministers Nimal Siripala de Silva, Gamini Lokuge, and Prof. G.L. Peiris filed interlocutory petitions seeking permission to present cross-submissions pertaining to the petitions challenging the 20th Amendment draft bill. 

 In addition, MPs Sagara Kariyawasam, Ven. Omare Kassapa Thera, M. Dayaratne, W.A. Weerathilake, and P.G.B. Abeyratne also filed interlocutory petitions. 

 Wimal’s missive 

 The National Freedom Front (NFF), a key coalition partner of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), wrote publicly to Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa stating that the party is disappointed over the failure to include any of the amendments to the draft bill proposed by its Leader, Minister Wimal Weerawansa, in the proposal of amendments to the draft of 20A of the Government submitted by the AG in court. 

 The letter titled “Amendments to be made to the 20th Amendment to the Constitution during the Parliamentary Committee Stage” includes concerns of the party regarding the amendments that should be included in the draft of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution at the parliamentary committee stage. 

 On behalf of the politburo of the NFF, its General Secretary S. Wijayasiri had forwarded the letter to Prime Minister Rajapaksa, and it was thereafter released to the media. 

 The letter stressed that the NFF and the general public were strongly opposed to a number of provisions central to the proposed 20th Amendment. “Neglecting those points will negatively impact the image of the Government and the spirit of the public mandate, which the Prime Minister would also agree on,” the letter states. 

 The first point emphasised is the exemption of companies registered under the Registrar of Companies, of which the Government holds the majority of shares, from the Auditor General’s audit. 

 The second point is the passing of emergency acts without informing the general public regarding such through gazette notifications or providing adequate time for their constitutionality to be determined by the SC. 

 They also objected to the 20th Amendment’s favourable treatment of Sri Lankans who are also citizens of other countries and seek to enter Parliament, run for president, serve as diplomats, or hold other senior government positions that could bring their national loyalties into question. 

 Through the letter to the Prime Minister, the NFF had respectfully emphasised that the Government should correct those mistakes. 

 The party stated that this should be a political stance taken to protect the public mandate and in the event the Government, as a whole, chooses to ignore this political stance, the party will not be held politically responsible in this regard. The NFF holds six precious seats in Parliament, without whose support the Government would be unable to secure the 250 votes necessary to pass the 20th Amendment. 

 NFF MPs, including its Leader Weerawansa, voted in favour of the 19th Amendment when it was passed in 2015. 

 Wijeyadasa concerned 

 SLPP parliamentarian Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe had written to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, raising his own concerns about the 20th Amendment and expressing doubts about whether he would vote for the Bill. 

 The letter, addressed to President Rajapaksa and copied to Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, said that Dr. Rajapakshe was concerned about violating his pledge to defend the Constitution of Sri Lanka by voting for such an amendment. He had also opined that the Government could have opted to simply remove the negative aspects of the 19th Amendment and retain its positive features, rather than eradicate it completely. Dr. Rajapakshe voted in favour of the 19th Amendment in 2015 and served as Minister of Justice at the time. 

 In the letter, Dr. Rajapakshe called for the power to appoint ministers to be given exclusively to the President, rather than for this to be done in consultation with the Prime Minister. He also proposed that instead of the Parliamentary Council, the Constitutional Council be expanded to include the President’s nominee and a nominee from minor parties to expand it to seven members. 

 If any issues arose in the function of the independent commissions, they could be resolved through discussions between the President and the Parliamentary Council, he proposed. 

 MR responds 

 Prime Minister Rajapaksa on Sunday (4) held a public meeting and vigorously defended the proposed 20th Amendment Bill, refuting allegations that the enactment of the bill would reduce the powers of the Auditor General or remove important institutions from the department’s oversight. 

 “All the 20th Amendment seeks to do is to replace the changes made to the provisions relating to the Auditor General by the 19th Amendment with the provisions that existed before the 19th Amendment,” the Prime Minister said in a statement. 

 He said the Opposition has been trying to propagate the idea that the Auditor General’s powers would be reduced by the proposed constitutional amendment and it is easier to propagate various falsehoods in this connection, as it is seldom that the constitutional provisions regarding the Auditor General come to the attention of the public. 

 He said one such false claim being made is that the 19th Amendment set up an Audit Commission and that the 20th Amendment seeks to abolish it. 

 “What the 19th Amendment made provision for was not an Audit Commission but only an Audit Service Commission (ASC). The ASC does not carry out any auditing functions. It handles matters like the appointment, promotion, transfer, and disciplinary control of members of the State Audit Service. 

 “Usually, such matters pertaining to government servants are dealt with by the Public Service Commission. All that the creation of the ASC achieved was to set up yet another commission to do the work that was being done by the Public Service Commission,” Rajapaksa said. 

 He said another such claim being made by the Opposition is that the 20th Amendment seeks to remove the Presidential Secretariat and the Office of the Prime Minister from the purview of the Auditor General, when in fact the amendment simply removed redundant and unnecessary language. 

 The Prime Minister explained that from the very inception of the 1978 Constitution, the Presidential Secretariat and the Prime Minister’s Office have been under the purview of the Auditor General. The phrase “all departments of government” in Article 154(1) of the pre-19th Amendment Constitution brought the Presidential Secretariat and the Prime Minister’s Office under the purview of the Auditor General. 

 “These institutions were always listed as government departments in the Government Financial Regulations. Quite apart from these two institutions, even the Office of Former Presidents is listed as a separate government department and all these institutions were always audited by the Auditor General,” he said. 

 Rajapaksa said that the inclusion of the Presidential Secretariat and the Office of the Prime Minister by name in Article 154(1) by the 19th Amendment did not achieve anything new. 

 “Even though they may have not been specifically mentioned by name, from the very inception of the 1978 Constitution, the Presidential Secretariat and Prime Minister’s Office had always been under the purview of the Auditor General. 

 “Even after the 20th Amendment reinstates the old Article 154(1) which existed from the inception of the 1978 Constitution, in place of the so-called ‘changes’ made by the 19th Amendment, the Presidential Secretariat and the Prime Minister’s Office will continue to remain within the purview of the Auditor General. Over the past decades, it’s the Auditor General who audited the Presidential Secretariat and the Prime Minister’s Office and not some private audit firm.” 

 The Prime Minister said another falsehood that’s being propagated is that state-owned companies will be removed from the purview of the Auditor General by the 20th Amendment and explained that the auditing of state corporations and state-owned companies (i.e. companies in which the State owns more than 50% of the shares) comes under Article 154(2) of the Constitution. 

 He said that under the provisions of Article 154(2), the minister in charge of the subject can assign the auditing of a state corporation or a state-owned company to a qualified audit firm, but before doing so, he is mandatorily required to obtain the concurrence of the Finance Minister and also to consult the Auditor General. 

 “After the minister in charge of the subject assigns the auditing of a state corporation or a state-owned company to an audit firm in this manner, the Auditor General can issue a written notice to that audit firm, informing them that he proposes to utilise their services for the performance and discharge of the Auditor General’s duties in relation to that state corporation or state-owned company, and thereupon that audit firm is mandatorily required to act under the direction and control of the Auditor General,” he said. 

 The Prime Minister added that the contents of Article 154(2), which existed from the inception of the 1978 Constitution, were not changed by the 19th Amendment and will not change under the 20th Amendment either. 

 “Therefore, it can be said that the contents of Article 154(2) have remained the same from the inception of the 1978 Constitution and will continue to remain so in the future as well. Hence, the claim that state-owned companies are to be taken out of the purview of the Auditor General is a complete falsehood.” 

 Rajapaksa added that it’s also being claimed by Opposition propagandists that the 19th Amendment had stipulated that the Auditor General should be a “qualified auditor” and that when the 20th Amendment reinstates the old pre-19th Amendment Article 153(1), this qualification requirement will be dropped and hence, after the 20th Amendment is passed, even an unqualified person can be appointed as the Auditor General. 

 “Constitutions are written on the assumption that those reading it will have basic common sense. The Constitution does not state anywhere that the person appointed as Attorney General or as a Supreme Court judge has to be a qualified lawyer. But those appointed as Attorney General, Auditor General, or a Supreme Court judge will always have the required educational and professional qualifications without which they cannot function in those positions,” the PM said in the statement. 

 Democracy? 

 SLPP Chairman Prof. G.L. Peiris last week downplayed the growing chorus of dissenting voices within the governing ranks against the 20th Amendment, insisting that such debate was a natural part of the democratic process. 

 Prof. Peiris told a news briefing last Monday (5) that opposing views on a selection of clauses included in the 20th Amendment by Weerawansa and SLPP parliamentarian Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe were part of the democratic process of citizens having the right to express their views. 

 “There are several stages to getting key legislation of this nature passed. There have been 39 petitions filed before the Supreme Court and we are awaiting the court’s decision on whether we need to hold a referendum. This decision will be conveyed to the Speaker by 12 October, which is the end of the three-week period specified in the Constitution. Then, there will be changes at the committee stage, and already we have said that some changes will be made,” he had told the media. 

 However, Prof. Peiris has declined to elaborate on whether the points raised by Weerawansa would be addressed. On Sunday (4), Weerawansa said his party objected to dual citizens being allowed to hold any post in Parliament, including becoming executive president, as well as passing emergency legislation without prior gazette publications. The NFF also objected to certain companies the Government was a majority shareholder of being exempt from the oversight of the Auditor General. 

 Prof. Peiris defended the inclusion of dual citizenship, alleging that it was only introduced in the 19th Amendment to target specific members of the Rajapaksa family. 

 MS’ woes 

 The security provided to the governing SLPP’s coalition partner, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Leader and former President MP Maithripala Sirisena, has been reduced, much to the displeasure of the SLFPers. 

 The security provided to Sirisena has been reduced by half, it is learnt. 

 Sirisena had been assigned a contingent of 120 security personnel, offered earlier to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, which has now been reduced to 60 personnel. 

 It is also learnt that there are moves to reacquire part of the official residence premises assigned to Sirisena. The Ministry of Public Administration is in the process of making the necessary arrangements for the reacquisition of some areas of the compound. 

 It is noteworthy that the security and land allocation of the official premises of Sirisena are being reduced in the backdrop of the SLFP holding discussions on the proposed 20th Amendment Bill with SLPP Founder and theoretician Basil Rajapaksa. 

 According to unofficial reports, the discussion on the matter of the 20th Amendment between the SLFP and Basil has made progress, with both sides agreeing on several key concerns. 

 Opposition Leader’s security 

 On the topic of official security, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa has also faced a similar predicament, as he feels the number of security personnel assigned to him is insufficient. 

 The Opposition Leader’s Office had written to Defence Secretary Maj. Gen. Kamal Gunaratne on 30 September, stating that the security contingent assigned to Premadasa was insufficient. 

 The letter recalled the attack on a meeting attended by the Opposition Leader last month in the Mount Lavinia police area, stating it was evident that there was a need for more security to be assigned to Premadasa. 

 The letter signed by the Opposition Leader’s Private Secretary noted that there’s a need for an increase in security personnel since there needs to be several personnel who can provide advance security as well as accompany Premadasa when he attends scheduled public meetings. 

 Rishadgate 

 Last week also saw a growing controversy over All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) Leader MP Rishad Bathiudeen, following a photograph of him going viral on social media where he is seen shaking hands with Minister Chamal Rajapaksa at an event attended by the Defence Secretary. 

 The photograph was publicised in the backdrop of Bathiudeen’s brother, Riyaj Bathiudeen, who was in police custody over the Easter Sunday attacks probe, being suddenly released by the Police, citing a lack of evidence to prosecute him. 

 The growing public scepticism of the possibility of a political “deal” between certain senior members of the Government and Bathiudeen finally resulted in President Gotabaya Rajapaksa denying that the Government had entered into any political deal with Bathiudeen. 

 The President made this denial through a Facebook message. 

 He said that he was not prepared to hand over the power of arresting or arbitrarily releasing people to politicians. 

 President Rajapaksa said that he will take actions to rectify any omissions or mistakes made by relevant officials or authorities, if any. The President further said that he will not forsake the trust placed in him by Sri Lankan citizens. 

 The full message of President Rajapaksa is as follows: 

 “Ensuring national security is the first and foremost responsibility of my Government. I am not prepared to hand over the power of arresting or arbitrarily releasing people to politicians, as happened in the past. 

 “I will also take actions to rectify any omissions or mistakes made by the relevant authorities or officials. I emphasise that our Government has not entered into any political deal with parliamentarian Rishad Bathiudeen. 

 “I assure my citizens that I will not forsake the trust that they have placed in me and I will most certainly continue to work towards strengthening the built trust.” 

 Cardinal gets tough 

 His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith has raised concerns over the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) releasing Bathiudeen’s brother. 

 Referring to Riyaj Bathiudeen, he said that suspects whose actions were investigated over the allegations pertaining to the Easter Sunday bombings were released from custody by the CID. 

 In a special media briefing held on 3 October at the Archbishop’s House in Colombo, the Cardinal raised suspicions that a “political deal” is behind the move. 

 Surprised and saddened by the CID’s conduct, he urged the authorities to properly carry out the investigations in this regard. 

 The Cardinal also referred to a statement made by Police Media Spokesperson SSP Jaliya Senaratne, in which he said that investigations into the carnage have revealed that the parliamentarian’s brother has maintained direct links with the bombers. 

 Speaking further, the Cardinal pointed out that the Police Spokesperson’s statement and the CID’s move are in complete contradiction. 

 SSP Senaratne, in a recent media briefing, announced that Riyaj Bathiudeen was released due to “lack of evidence” to file a case against him. 

 However, Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith had to postpone a meeting that was previously scheduled to be held this week with Catholic MPs due to the prevalent coronavirus situation. 

 Secretary to the Bishop Rev. Fr. Deninton Subasinghe confirmed to The Morning earlier this week that the meeting had been postponed by Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith. 

 He said the meeting had been scheduled for Tuesday (6). 

 “The Cardinal wanted to meet the MPs to discuss an array of matters.” 

 It is learnt that the probe into the Easter Sunday attacks was to be taken up for discussion during the meeting. 

 It is in this backdrop that CID Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Nuwan Wedasinghe was suddenly transferred as the Acting DIG of Western Province-North while DIG S.P. Ranasinghe, a former senior CID officer with diplomatic experience, was appointed as the new DIG of the CID. 

 The transfers were implemented with immediate effect. ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Covid-19 infects 20A,news,0,1602379868,0,100619,,
,,Keeping the second wave at bay,news," Despite the multitude of mitigatory efforts over the past few months, Covid-19 is once again playing havoc in the country. Last week’s explosion of cases stemming from a private apparel manufacturing facility in Minuwangoda is continuing to cause ripples with cases being detected on a daily basis in at least 16 places across the country so far. It seems the worst-case scenario is now upon us and history has taught us that it is better for the authorities to admit the fact at the outset and get down to implementing the required action, rather than live in denial and present a brave face. 

For Covid-19 to be tackled, it is essential that the authorities take the people into their confidence and obtain their co-operation to minimise the impact of what is now effectively a second wave. At the end of the day, despite all the regulations in place, if the people don’t co-operate in protecting themselves as well as each other from this raging pandemic, the mitigatory efforts now being rolled out are not likely to have their desired effect. Therefore, it is essential that all stakeholders act in concert so as to mobilise the people to act as the virus guard against this deadly virus. 

 Sri Lanka was lucky to get off lightly in the first wave, considering the magnitude and scale of the Covid-19 epidemic in neighbouring India, which even last Friday (9) recorded 70,000-plus cases within 24 hours. India is second only to the worst affected country, the US, and currently has nearly seven million cases and 107,000 known deaths. Therefore, it goes without saying that every precaution needs to be taken on the interaction of people between the two countries. The recent proposal of the Minister of Tourism to open up a travel bubble between the two countries for tourism will be like, in the current context, jumping from the frying pan into the fire. 

 The private enterprise that operates the Minuwangoda apparel manufacturing facility has come under fire, especially on social media, as being responsible for causing the second wave by bringing down a group of people from its production facility in Vishakapatnam, India via a charter flight that arrived at the Mattala Airport on 22 September. However, the criticism seems unfounded based on what the Head of the Covid-19 Task Force has been saying on the likely origins of the source. For all intents and purposes, no one up to now knows how and when Covid-19 manifested in Minuwangoda. Needless to say, it is a worrisome scenario, given Sri Lanka’s proximity to the virus hotbed next door. 

 Sri Lanka can ill-afford to fall victim to a similar predicament, given the limited healthcare resources and economic repercussions. It is safe to say that the vast majority of private businesses are still reeling from the impact of the first wave, and key sectors like tourism, hospitality, and retail continue to be in the doldrums. As a result, government revenue has been hit hard and making ends meet will be even more challenging in the days ahead. With the situation being what it is, the authorities have no option but to be proactive and nip this latest outbreak in the bud, if that is even possible, given the fact that the cases are already widespread. 

 It seems the Government is well aware of the need to keep the economy ticking, which is why it has so far desisted from imposing a blanket lockdown like it did in March, restricting such action to specific areas in the Gampaha District. The Government now has to walk a fine line in ensuring the health system does not overheat, while at the same time ensuring that people are able to safely engage in their day-to-day activities without spreading or falling victim to the virus which has also made inroads into the commercial capital with multiple cases being detected over the week. 

 Since the Government has outlined its strategy, the way forward is by aggressively expanding testing capacity. Rather than waiting for sick people to turn up at hospitals where spreading of the virus may already have happened, it is far more advisable for the health authorities to go to the people instead and carry out random testing at least in the high-risk areas and mitigate possible community spread by identifying and isolating virus carriers. The fact that nearly 90% of positive cases identified at the Minuwangoda facility have been asymptomatic is another challenge that has to be overcome through aggressive testing across vulnerable cities and towns. There is simply no other way than testing, testing, and more testing. 

 It was pointed out by the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) last week that ongoing testing is still well below capacity. According to the GMOA, the current testing capacity is around 4,000 tests per day, but only about 2,000 are being carried out at present. If Sri Lanka is to avoid being another India, testing has to be increased rapidly, covering the entire island. It is pointless to bolt the stable door after the horse has bolted, and this is the challenge the health authorities must embrace without delay. 

 Already many sectors have been adversely affected, even though a general lockdown has not been imposed. Schools, universities, tuition classes, bars, pubs, and nightclubs have been ordered to be shut while a ban has been imposed on any events being held. Many daily wage earners are once again without employment. While restrictions are certainly the need of the hour, these steps must be complemented with health measures in order to stop the spread of the virus. There is no point in keeping state and private sector offices open while cutting down on bus and train services, as the available services are bound to be congested. One way out is for the state sector to embrace smart technology and work remotely. 

 However, this is easier said than done, as it is akin to letting the fox guard the chicken coop. The million-rupee question is: How do you get the notoriously lethargic and inefficient public sector to work remotely when they don’t even work in their appointed offices? This certainly is a poser for the authorities, but one that needs to be figured out sooner than later since Covid-19 will be around for some time, at least until a vaccine is discovered. 

 Meanwhile, on the economic front, the Opposition has been complaining that the economic data for the second quarter has not been forthcoming even though it is well past the due date. It does not take Einstein to predict that the full impact of the first lockdown was felt in the second and third quarters of financial year 2020 and the numbers cannot be anything but dire, with the first quarter even before the Covid impact registering a 1.6% contraction. With a second wave now on the horizon, the same is expected to befall the fourth quarter, making 2020 an unprecedented disaster in economic terms. 

 The World Bank last week gave an indication of what was to be anticipated, forecasting a 6.7% contraction of the economy for the year. To put it into perspective, Sri Lanka’s highest growth rate of 7% was achieved in 2012 and has been on the decline ever since. Now, just eight years later, the economy has shrunk by as much. 

 Given the status quo, the administration has a Herculean task to get the indicators back in the black, hopefully at some point next year. The World Bank at least is confident of such a prospect as per its forecast released last week. But much needs to be done to get there and every measure taken now to mitigate the second wave of Covid-19 will certainly help the cause.

,,Environmental Act to be amended,focus," By Sarah Hannan  

 The National Environmental Act of Sri Lanka is to undergo amendments in order to increase fines and terms of imprisonment against those who violate the Act, Minister of Environment Mahinda Amaraweera revealed. 

 “The fines and terms of imprisonment will be increased up to 10 times to curb the destruction that is caused to wildlife, forests, and the biodiversity of the country. We are looking to draft amendments to the existing Environmental Act and hopefully will be able to propose it to the Cabinet of Ministers for approval, after which it will be sent to the Attorney General (AG) for approval and enactment,” Amaraweera stated. 

 He further reiterated that contrary to what many social media posts have been speculating, the amount of deforestation around the country within forest reserves were unfounded and only about four such protected areas were subjected to encroachment-related destruction. 

 “Some social media outlets are spreading false propaganda that large-scale environmental damage is being done with the connivance of the Government. In the past, politicians and powerful people were freed, but now the common people are caught and punished for a small mistake. There is no room for that,” Amaraweera elaborated. 

 He added that the law is to be enforced against the perpetrators regardless of their political affiliation or social position, as displayed by the law enforcement when a politician’s brother was arrested over the destruction that took place in the Anawilundawa Wetland Sanctuary. 

 Given that there is an increase in environmental destruction activities, the Minister noted that through the District Co-ordinating Committees that meet once a month, a special unit to look into environmental matters will be appointed. 

 “This will allow the District Committee to take decisions over development projects that are to be launched in their respective areas, and with the recommendations of the environmental unit, they would be able to take decisions that would not adversely impact the biodiversity of an area.” 

 Amaraweera also noted that some of the events relating to environmental destruction that took place over the past months did not entirely take place in protected zones or areas that belonged to the Government. 

 “When the mass felling of trees or torching of vegetation takes place in privately owned land, we cannot mediate. For instance, there were situations where the private landowner, after a lapse of two to three years, had decided to clear their land for cultivation using heavy machinery; even these activities had been documented and shared on social media,” he explained. 

 Therefore, Amaraweera reiterated that even the provincial reporters and the public should first find out whether it is privately owned land or whether it is a government-owned land that is being cleared. 

 If it is a private land, the Ministry of Environment will not be able to take legal action against the situation. However, these private landowners are supposed to get a permit to use heavy machinery within the land areas for clearing from the district/divisional secretariat and keep the area environmental authorities informed of such activities. 

 Speaking further about the enforcement of law on perpetrators who destroy the environment, Amaraweera noted that he had recently noticed that law enforcement officers are at times showing reluctance to arrest certain individuals or take action against certain entities that are connected to such activities. 

 “I urge the Police to take prompt action on such persons or institutions, regardless of their political or social positioning. I can assure that over a recent incident of environmental destruction, the Government is in no way influencing the Police from carrying out their duties. The Police is in fact being requested to arrest the politically connected figure immediately, but it is quite concerning as to why the Police is not acting accordingly,” Amaraweera said. 

 Regarding the amendments to be made to the National Environmental Act, the Minister noted that further discussions are to take place with the participation of all concerned stakeholders, adding that the Ministry would give them an opportunity to share their recommendations on how penalties can be increased and how to fortify the regulations that are in place, so that strict action could be taken against the perpetrators without delay.

,,Barrier-free access in public spaces | Proper access still blocked,focus,"By Sarah Hannan    

 Although Sri Lanka passed its Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act in 1996, 24 years later we still don’t see any progress in making public   spaces and institutions accessible to   persons with disabilities (PwDs)  . 

 Increasing disability access is important in increasing employability of PwDs in an effective manner, thereby garnering their contribution to the national economy. 

 According to data from the Department of Census and Statistics, 70.93% of   PwDs are not economically active. Out of the persons who are not economically active, 47.96% are too old to work and 36.92% are engaged in household work, while the rest is a composite of students, children not attending school, income recipients, pensioners, social workers, and others.    

 In accordance with the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act No. 28 of 1996, all existing public buildings, public places, and areas wherever common services are available, shall be made accessible to persons with disabilities in compliance with the Disabled Persons (Accessibility) Regulations No. 1 of 2006 published in the Government Gazettes Extraordinary No. 1467/15 on 17 October 2006 and No. 1619/24 on 18 September 2009.  

  The Sunday Morning    learnt that these Gazettes were being amended to suit present times, and measures were being taken to create awareness on the urgent need to provide accessibility to PwDs at the institutional level. 

  The Sunday Morning    contacted the National Secretariat for Persons with Disabilities (NSPD) to gauge the progress made following the issuance of these Gazettes.  

 Responding to our query, NSPD Assistant Director   Ishanka Herath said that issues prevail with many of the buildings that were constructed prior to 2009, and that most of the new buildings are compliant to the regulations listed under the Gazettes.    

 “When we consider the designs of the old state institution buildings, none of them were constructed with a disabled person in mind. Therefore, if they are to make any changes to the structure, they would have to incur a considerable cost, and the approval process for such changes would also take a considerable amount of time,” Herath explained.  

 However, since 2009, their Secretariat saw some progress, especially in buildings constructed under the purview of the Urban Development Authority (UDA), as these had strictly adhered to the guidelines stipulated.  

 Further amendments    

 She also noted that the previous Gazettes did not permit the Secretariat to impose penalties against those who did not adhere to the regulations. Therefore, they are discussing the inclusion of some amendments to the regulatory act in that regard.  

 “We are hopeful that with the ongoing discussions with the UDA, National Transport Commission, Sri Lanka Railways, Road Development Authority (RDA), Ministry of Transport, and other relevant stakeholders, an all-inclusive regulatory act can be drafted in the next two months,” Herath added.  

 In the meantime, the NSPD also proposed to the public transportation authorities and institutions to pay attention to the standards that should be followed when designing public spaces, especially when bringing down transport coaches that could be purpose built to enable   PwDs to move freely with minimum assistance.    

 At the moment, one such project that can be used as a benchmark is the   Makumbura Multimodal Transport Hub in Kottawa, which has been built with the consideration of providing convenient access to PwDs. 

 “However, we still have a small issue with the buses and railcars that are in use, as these are still not wheelchair-friendly. The Government has been advised on replacing such passenger coaches in the future, or at least having a ramp facility installed on public transport until such time.”  

 Herath said that the biggest obstacle in public transport is with railcars and train stations, as much of the railway infrastructure is outdated, and replacing it would require a massive budget and a considerable amount of time. The Secretariat is looking forward to working closely with Sri Lanka Railways and the Ministry of Transport on how the spaces could be converted to provide suitable access to   PwDs.    

 Ensuring barrier-free access    

 In a paper   published under the title “Disability Access in Public Buildings” for the International Research Conference on Sustainability in Built Environment, the   authors W.A.D.   Keerthirathna, Gayani Karunasena, and V.A.K. Rodrigo of the Department of Building Economics of the University of Moratuwa, noted that increasing disability access is important to “acquire their contribution to the national economy through employing them in an effective manner”.    

 During their research, they discovered existing facilities with disability access; hospital buildings were found to have provided sufficient facilities at entrances, doors and openings, staircases, and lifts; banks provide fewer facilities for disability access – ramps are provided in only 40% of bank buildings and 20% of ramps only provide handrails according to requirements.  

 In addition, while 90% of bank buildings are equipped with lifts, only 20% of buildings have lifts with the required space for disability access. Ramps are rarely seen within office and administration buildings (only 20%). In addition, certain buildings have toilet facilities that do not have grab rails installed, while only 20% of buildings provide toilets with doors that open outwards. 

 At the design stage of school buildings, less consideration is given to disability access. “Sixty percent of school buildings have thresholds of more than 15 mm in height at the entrance, hence it is difficult to enter on wheelchairs. No school building could be found with lift facilities. There were no ramps either.   Railway and bus stations do not provide satisfactory facilities for disability access.   Railway stations do not have enough space at entrance doors for wheelchair access. Seventy percent of buildings use more than 15 mm-high thresholds for the doors and openings. There are no ramps at the entrances for wheelchair access, and toilet facilities that were provided were of very poor quality,” the report read.  

 It is necessary to be concerned about a barrier-free environment. According to the Ministry of Social Services, there are four major groups of PwDs:  
 
           Persons with impaired hearing     
           Persons with intellectual impairment     
           Persons with impaired vision     
           Persons with physical disabilities     
 
 PwDs are an important group to consider when designing and constructing buildings because they need special facilities in order to access these. As such, designers must pay special attention to providing such facilities to ensure barrier-free access. Problems that arise on design considerations can be summarised as follows:  
           Unexpected vertical changes of levels (curbs, steps, ruts, gutters, etc.) prevent continuous accessible paths of travel  
           Excessive slopes (camber) across the direction of travel on a footpath, which makes control of the wheelchair difficult  
           Inadequate provision of space at doorways and within rooms to allow for wheelchair dimensions and turning circles  
           Not paying specific attention to steps and handrail design to ensure adequate support and a feeling of confidence and ease when negotiating steps  
           Seating does not consist of waiting areas at counters and along lengthy walkways to reduce tiredness  
            Access vulnerability associated with doors, including the need to manipulate a handle while using a walking aid and difficulty in moving quickly through swinging doors   
            Visual signs are not very clear and accurate. A flashing light unaccompanied by a message can be confusing (e.g. a flashing fire exit sign would be preferable to a flashing red light; it gets the message across much faster)  
            Lack of loud speakers with supplementary messages for public premises (e.g. railway stations, bus stations, and airports with visual messages)   
            Edges of walls, furniture, and other items are not rounded to prevent physical injury if people walk into it   
            Unguarded projections at heights such that someone who cannot see them would be in danger of walking into them  
            Obstructions such as cupboards, etc. along corridors or hallways

,,Technical terrorism hindering COPE: Dr. Charitha Herath,news,"By Sarah Hannan    

 The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) commenced its first session on Tuesday (6) under its newly appointed committee chaired by Dr. Charitha Herath, who is also a Member of Parliament appointed through the National List of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP).  

 After a two-and-a-half hour first inquiry, the committee was to meet on Thursday (8) as well.    However, due to the Covid-19 cluster that was activated on 3 October, the members had decided to postpone the session to be held during the next parliamentary session on 20 October.  

 This week,  The Sunday Morning  spoke to new COPE Chairman Dr. Herath on the challenges that the new committee is facing in conducting inquiries over the state-owned public enterprises and in questioning the irregularities revealed through the Auditor General's reports for the years 2009 to 2016.  

  The following are excerpts of the interview.   

 What will be the first batch of public enterprises that would come under scrutiny?  

 We have issued notices to Lanka Coal Company (Pvt.) Ltd. and have commenced inquiries over their audit reports for the years 2009-2016. For this company, the audit queries are already conducted and the Auditor General’s report was already submitted to Parliament. Based on those documents, we had discussions in our first session on Tuesday.  

 The Secretary to the Ministry of Power and Energy, the Chairman of Lanka Coal Company (Pvt.) Ltd., and representatives of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and Ceylon Shipping Corporation were required to attend the inquiry on Tuesday.  

 During these sessions, concerns were raised and observations were made by the Auditor General’s Department and it was revealed that there was a Rs. 1.1 billion loss that was incurred due to the mismanagement of certain sections of these stakeholder institutions over the span of seven years. Procurements made during 2015 especially came under scrutiny in the Auditor General’s report.  

 Which institutions will you first pick to follow up on based on the recommendations tabled by the previous committee report published on 21 February 2020?  

 We will have those follow-up sessions shortly. But before that, the new committee decided that we should take up the special audit reports that were submitted by the Auditor General’s Department up to now, which were not examined.  

 There are about 31 completed and tabled audit reports that we are deliberating and basing our discussions on at the COPE meetings that are to be held as starting sessions.  

 In the meantime, we thought that we will convene some of the institutions that were served observations and recommendations by the previous committee which were recorded in the 21 February 2020 COPE report.  

 Is the committee working on clearing the backlog of audits that have piled up for most of the state enterprises? Some have last been audited in 2015.  

 All state-owned public corporations that are overseen by COPE will look into the institutions that have not submitted their audit reports in a timely manner. The Auditor General’s Department, up until now, tabled all the audit reports that are available to them and have submitted it to COPE for deliberations and recommendations.  

 COPE cannot start an inquiry over a state institution if the audit report is not tabled. There cannot be incidents where some state institutions have evaded a government auditor and have not conducted an audit using an independent audit firm.  

 The missing audit reports can also be from institutions that are not operating at present, as there are many state corporations and institutions that are listed but have ceased their operations following the 1977 Open Economy.  

 Are you aware that some state corporations have not published their annual reports over the recent years?  

 I am not aware of such incidents but if there are state institutions that have failed to compile or publish their annual reports, it is of grave concern, and COPE will instruct the Auditor General’s Department to look into such institutions.  

 Even if the audit or annual reports are missing, certain institutions will still be called in for COPE sessions for inquiries. For instance, the Lanka Puwath news agency is currently non-operational, but it is still coming up on our records.  

 What are the challenges that you see for your team in having to probe certain institutions?  

 Every government that gets elected follows different management models to administrate the state institutions. Some governments followed the procurement guidelines and the regulatory frameworks, but some decided not to follow the due process.  

 The challenge that is upon this committee is to inform and educate these officials at these public institutions that they are just governing an asset that belongs to the public.  

 Moreover, getting the true facts about these institutions into the observations is imperative, as sometimes due to the technicalities that are involved in certain institutional procedures in preparing documentation, some malpractices can be covered up. We refer to that as “technical terrorism”;   the use of jargon and technical terms that are not explained in layman terms in their documentations that are submitted – the Auditor General’s Department officials at times might not understand the technical terms that are mentioned in the reports that are submitted by the institutions which becomes a challenge when they are auditing the institutions for compliance.  

 The lack of support that a newly appointed COPE is afforded by the state institutions in order to unveil the matters is another challenge that the committee faces.  

 Furthermore, the existing legality of COPE and the powers that are vested in the committee by the Parliament to take action over some of the observations that were presented during the sessions can greatly hinder the proceedings and their outcome.  

 The most pressing issue originates within COPE itself, as getting one collective voice from the committee that comprises members from different political parties holding different political opinions is the biggest challenge. These parliamentarians need to understand that this is a common committee that is inquiring over the state enterprises on behalf of the people that appointed them to office.  

 How are you planning to overcome the challenges?  

 I am trying to be impartial and I am striving to pass judgements that are ruled by facts over judgements passed by emotions.  

 As the Chairman of COPE, I am accountable to the people of Sri Lanka and I have a duty to report back to the public the proceedings of the committee meetings, as it is, and how the institutions are governed by the incumbent authorities and previous authorities.  

 Heading and reporting the proceedings to the public in a transparent manner can mitigate these various challenges that I have to face as the Chairman.  

 As I said earlier, we do not have a legal framework in place to impose penalties to the institutions that have not been diligent in their reporting. Despite that, as a committee, we are able to share the findings, observations, and recommendations that we have given to the said institutions with the public, who will ensure that they are held accountable for their wrongdoings.  

 What are your thoughts on opening the meeting proceedings to the media?  

 Let me set the record straight right now by saying that COPE at no point announced such a decision. It was purely speculation which was misinterpreted over a discussion which took place at the Committee on the Business of the House which consists of the party leaders. That committee suggested that they should relook at the media publicity arrangements of the Parliament and had nothing to do with COPE or COPA proceedings.  

 The first session was telecasted live and was opened to the media on Tuesday.  

 Is there a chance that personnel that are subjected to inquiries can get unnecessarily targeted due to this?  

 Actually, that was one concern that our committee had, and we have discussed this at length and have requested the committee members of COPE to be vigilant about the individuals, institution representatives, or heads who attend COPE sessions for inquiries.  

 The committee has been advised not to target these representatives who are in fact holding incumbent positions in these state institutions, and the matter in question might not be an issue that was created by their misdeeds.  

 It is unfair for the representatives that appear at COPE sessions to face such positions of unease for delays that were not caused by them but rather by the previous heads and representatives of that institution.  

 We are therefore not going to penalise the state officials who have now come before the committee to respond to the ongoing inquiries, for which COPE is given powers to openly question and report to the public with the media’s support.  

 I have a responsibility to maintain that rapport and allow the committee members to talk, but not to make any critical remarks that would tarnish their reputation as officers of the State.  

 You are essentially questioning the previous Government’s work through COPE and their expenditures and governance. How will you ensure that the proceedings are conducted in an unbiased manner?  

 The committee members cannot raise objections when the proceedings are ongoing. However, they are allowed to raise their concerns with me. Anyone is free to ask questions and the freedom to question was given with the understanding that they are not going to misuse the opportunity to cause any disruption to the proceedings.  

 In your first meeting, you were very focused on the energy and power sector, especially the coal power plant in Norochcholai and the emergency power purchases. Were you given sufficient information by the Opposition to proceed and conduct a transparent inquiry?  

 We were given all the information required to conduct our first session and the inquiry that was carried out was quite substantive which allowed us to have a lengthy discussion.  

 What elements do you think COPE proceedings are lacking and how will you improve them?  

 At the moment, we are discussing the possibilities of sharing the sessions on social media platforms to engage a larger audience.  

 Moreover, we are suggesting that the relevant authorities, such as the secretaries or the chairmen that appear at the sessions, follow the directions that are given by the committee and to report their progress within the given timeline, which will enable COPE to expedite the proceedings and identify the bottlenecks.  

 Finally, there are several regulatory issues that we plan to rectify and impose strict deadlines on, which the attendees will have to adhere to, so that the decisions could be reached in a timely manner.

,,PCoI on Easter Sunday attacks | Hearings to conclude this month,focus,"Former President Maithripala Sirisena arriving at BMICH on 5 October 2020 to provide evidence to the PCoI probing the Easter Sunday attacks.  Photo Krishan Kariyawasam

By Skandha Gunasekara  

With former President Maithripala Sirisena being one of the last key individuals to be questioned by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) probing the Easter Sunday attacks, the commission hopes to conclude its operations by the end of October. 

 Thus far, former President Sirisena has charged that former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the United National Party (UNP) Government worked against him, that non-governmental organisations (NGOs) were hampering reconciliation, and that former Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara and former Secretary of Defence Hemasiri Fernando were to be held accountable for allowing the Easter Sunday bombings to occur. 

 Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Cabinet only supported him during the first six months in power, former President Maithripala Sirisena told the PCoI investigating the Easter Sunday attacks. 

 Sirisena said that Wickremesinghe and the UNP began undermining him, as he (Sirisena) started talking against the Bond Scam. Things only became worse when he appointed a PCoI on the Bond Scam, he said. 

 Responding to a question posed by the Attorney General's (AG) Department official that led the evidence, Sirisena said that from the time former President Ranasinghe Premadasa lowered the ceiling for a party to enter Parliament to 5% of the total vote, minorities had strong sways in successive governments. 

 The sixth Parliament of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, from April 2004 to February 2010, had 27 Muslim MPs, out of which 18 held ministerial posts. Meanwhile, the seventh Parliament, from April 2010 to June 2015, had 17 Muslim MPs, out of which 13 held ministerial posts. The eighth Parliament, from September 2015 to March 2020, had 22 Muslim MPs, out of which 11 held ministerial posts. 

 This was data compiled by the commission and Sirisena was informed of these statistics. 

 ""When the ceiling for a party to enter Parliament was 12.5% of the total vote, this wasn't a problem. While we must ensure that we get the ideas and opinions of all groups in the country, we must also keep extremism in mind. I must remind you that all Muslim ministers of the eighth Parliament was with the UNP,"" he said. 

 The former President said that at present, politicians do not have the ability to address mistrust between various ethnic and religious groups, and that special institutions with the required resources need to be established to address these issues. 

 Sirisena added that he had just returned to his hotel after obtaining medical treatment at a hospital in Singapore when he was informed of the Easter Sunday attacks 

 ""I then called the Prime Minister, the Secretary to the President, the Defence Secretary, and the IGP. I instructed them to take the necessary steps. I also called the then CDS (Chief of Defence Staff) Shavendra Silva. I called the Secretary to the President again and told him that we need to appoint a committee because we needed to find out what happened,"" the former President said. 

 Sirisena said that he had been feeling unwell and thus instructed his Secretary to come up with a list of names. 

 ""The Secretary to the President came up with some names that I also found acceptable and I asked him to prepare the appointment letters. I returned the next day and gave the appointment letters before holding the National Security Council (NSC) meeting at 10 a.m. on 22 April. Appointing this PCoI was one of the recommendations of the committee I appointed, headed by Justice Vijith Malalgoda,"" Sirisena said. 

 He also told the PCoI investigating the Easter attacks that a large number of NGOs actively worked against reconciliation in the country by preventing people from overcoming various traumas they had endured in the past. 

 ""All governments faced this problem. There are some good NGOs that do a lot for the people. But a large number of them want to ensure that people are angry and resentful. During my time as President, NGOs played a big role in hindering our reconciliation work,"" he said. 

 Sirisena added that these NGOs often work beyond their stipulated criteria. 

 “For example, they profess to support Montessori kids, but they go into Tamil villages and conduct skits and plays with children that focus on issues faced during the war. They want children who had not faced the war to be traumatised as well,"" he said. 

 Sirisena said that some Muslim organisations too bring in extremist preachers into the country and that these men played a significant role in the spread of Wahabism. 

 Furthermore, he said that former IGP Pujith Jayasundara and former Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando were responsible for not preventing the Easter Sunday attacks. 

 Sirisena made the above claim responding to a question posed by the representative from the AG’s Department who led the evidence. 

 Former Minister and current Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Harin Fermando too made a questionable statement to the PCoI when he claimed that the Catholic Church, including Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, had been forewarned of the attack. 

 However, the Catholic Church was quick to reject MP Fernando’s statements. 

 The Archbishop’s House charged that Fernando was making baseless allegations against Cardinal Malcom Ranjith. 

 “We wish to therefore condemn this puerile attempt of MP Fernando to find excuses for his own grave misdeed and cast unjust aspersions on his eminence. We reiterate that we fully trust the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to render justice to the hundreds of innocent individuals who lost their lives or were maimed for life due to, both the hateful actions of the terrorists and the shameful inaction of the political and administrative as well as intelligence officials of that time, who are responsible for this mindless carnage of human beings. Justice must prevail at all costs,” the Archbishop’s House said in a statement. 

 The Archbishop’s House went on to assert that neither the Cardinal nor the Archdiocese of Colombo had any prior knowledge of the attacks. 

 “Once again, we affirm categorically that the Cardinal and the bishops as well as the Catholic clergy were in no way made aware of this plot by anyone and so the allegation is baseless.” 

 Throwing a curveball at the investigations, authorities on 30 September released the brother of MP Rishad Bathiudeen, Riyaj Bathiudeen, from custody. 

 Bathiudeen was arrested in the run up to the parliamentary elections over alleged connections to the Easter Sunday terror attacks. 

 In response, the Cardinal said that he was disappointed to know that a suspect had been released prior to proper legal proceedings being followed. 

 “It is sad to note the release of a suspect held in connection with the Easter Sunday attacks,” Cardinal Ranjith said at a press conference in Colombo. 

 “It is sad that the investigations are not going the way it should,” he said. 

 Meanwhile, State Minister of Internal Security, Home Affairs, and Disaster Management Chamal Rajapaksa in Parliament last week asserted that Bathiudeen had been released due to the lack of evidence. 

 Meanwhile, Secretary to the PCoI investigating the Easter attacks Buwaneka Herath said that the Commission’s term ended on 20 December and that they would submit a report by then.

Strict action against those violating quarantine    
Doubts on whether old or new strain: GMOA    
 
By Maheesha Mudugamuwa

The second wave of the coronavirus officially hit Sri Lanka last week, as it recorded the largest-ever Covid-19 cluster since the first coronavirus patient was identified in the island in January this year.

However, the authorities are taking strict measures to control the spread of the virus while the Army and Police are currently tracking the contacts. The contacts this time are described as the hardest to track down compared to the previous smaller clusters reported a few months ago.

Even though the authorities have failed to identify the source of the Minuwangoda Covid-19 cluster, they denied any social transmission of the virus at the moment.

As statistics have shown, over 1,000 Covid-19-positive cases have so far been identified through PCR tests conducted during the week and among them, almost all positive patients, apart from some, are employees of the Brandix factory in Minuwangoda or their close associates.

So far, several patients have been reported outside the Minuwangoda cluster as well.

Nevertheless, the Government is yet to make a decision on imposing a lockdown.

 No countrywide lockdown 

Army Chief Lt. Gen. Shavendra Silva said last week that they do not intend to impose a countrywide curfew or a lockdown in Colombo city over the weekend, as they did not see any threat in areas other than those identified over the week.

Urging the public to take the necessary health precautions, Lt. Gen. Silva said authorities were currently closely monitoring the situation.

The Army Chief said that as detections had been made in many areas outside the Gampaha District, those living in areas outside the high-risk region under continued police curfew, should be cautious. Those living in areas outside Gampaha too faced serious risk, the Army Chief warned. So far, the curfew covers only the Gampaha District.

 Brandix in the limelight 

A rumour was making the rounds that the employees of Brandix got infected from those who had come down to Sri Lanka from India. Allegations were also levelled against the management of Brandix that because they had not conducted proper health check-ups of their employees, the Covid-19 cluster spread throughout society.

Responding to allegations, Lt. Gen. Silva said that only 48 Sri Lankans working at the Brandix facility in India had been brought back, although there were reports of 60 returnees, and all of them had been quarantined at a hotel in Kosgoda and were made to undergo RT-PCR tests.

Meanwhile, Ministry of Health Chief Epidemiologist Dr. Sudath Samaraweera denied allegations levelled against the management of Brandix that they had ignored symptoms shown by their employees and instead instructed them to continue their routine work.

When contacted by  The Sunday Morning , Dr. Samaraweera said it was unfair to point fingers at the management at present when the whole country was ignoring the health guidelines and behaving like there was no threat at all.

Commenting on the number of tests conducted at present, he said the authorities were currently conducting the maximum number of tests possible. “This is a big cluster and therefore, it takes some time to conduct the tests,” he said.

Dr. Samaraweera also noted that the apparel worker who was first diagnosed with the new coronavirus was not the origin of the Covid-19 cluster at the Minuwangoda Brandix garment factory and the virus may have been in the factory for several weeks.

According to Dr. Samaraweera, the employees of the factory had been suffering from respiratory ailments since 20 September.

He said that the Minuwangoda garment factory worker who was first diagnosed with the new coronavirus had shown symptoms on 28 September and was admitted to the hospital on 30 September.

“Therefore, the first patient identified was an intermediate patient, who had previously been infected with the virus at the garment factory, and it is possible that the first patient may have recovered by now,” he said.

He said since the first patients to be reported were from the factory, and if symptoms had appeared on 20 September, the virus would have entered the factory two weeks or more prior.

Even though it’s been a week since the identification of the first Covid-19 patient from Minuwangoda, the health and law-enforcement authorities were yet unable to detect the origin of the Minuwangoda cluster,  The Sunday Morning  learnt.

The authorities are, however, warning that the next couple of days would be crucial when it comes to the spread of the disease.

So far, Covid-19 cases have been reported from the Anuradhapura, Badulla, Galle, Kurunegala, Monaragala, Puttalam, Kegalle, Kalutara, Kandy, Matara, Polonnaruwa, and Ratnapura Districts and all these cases were directed for immediate treatment and quarantine, according to the Health Ministry.

Chief Epidemiologist Dr. Samaraweera also told the media earlier this week that it would be a very difficult task to identify who had got infected first among the Brandix workers.

The number of infections could be several thousand although approximately 1,100 persons had so far tested positive – the vast majority of them Brandix employees. Police headquarters said that the person who supplied food to the Minuwangoda police station too had tested positive. The Police identified his son as a Brandix worker. Later, nearly 100 officers and men attached to the Minuwangoda Police were subjected to RT-PCR tests while services were suspended temporarily.

Last Wednesday night (7), while being moved by the Army to a quarantine facility, a person died of a heart attack.

 Public urged to take precautions 

Police Spokesman DIG Ajith Rohana also said some of those high-risk groups were yet to voluntarily submit themselves for RT-PCR tests.

Urging the public to wear face masks and adhere to the health guidelines, he said even though police curfew was imposed only in 18 police areas in the Gampaha District, the risk and danger of Covid-19 spreading across the county still remained.

Meanwhile, DIG Rohana said that according to health and intelligence unit statistics, several employees attached to the Brandix factory in Minuwangoda are to be traced to undergo quarantine. Around 125 employees at Brandix reported to the respective police stations and health officials last Thursday (8) for the quarantine process.

The Police Spokesman, however, said that strict action would be taken against those who continue to avoid the quarantine process under the Quarantine and Prevention of Diseases Ordinance.

Experts too think infections can grow if people ignore health guidelines.

The Covid-19 pandemic is continuing across the globe, with over 36 million cases reported across 190 countries.

 Resurgence in Covid-19 

Not just Sri Lanka, but many countries across Europe are also seeing a resurgence in Covid-19 cases after successfully slowing outbreaks earlier in the year. According to international media reports, the vast majority of countries are declaring more cases each day now than they were during the first wave earlier this year. But, while infection numbers may appear higher, it could simply be that increases in testing capacity are identifying more cases.

Although countries across Europe previously appeared to have gained control of the virus through strict lockdown measures, many countries in this region are now concerned about experiencing a second wave. The second spike of Covid-19 cases was seen in the UK at the start of August, and while the new daily cases are currently increasing at a lower rate than was seen in the first wave, precautionary measures must be taken to prevent them from increasing any further.

 A new strain of virus? 

Concerns have been raised over the current strain of the Covid-19 virus, as doubts have emerged on whether the country is hit by a new strain of the virus,  The Sunday Morning  learnt.

According to the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA), a clear picture of the ongoing situation could only be assessed after a lapse of 48 hours as tests were still being conducted and the investigations were still underway, they said on Friday (9).

GMOA Secretary Dr. Senal Fernando told  The Sunday Morning  that in the current situation, even asymptomatic persons seem to be spreading the virus more than the earlier situation.

“We still don’t know whether we have got a new strain or whether it’s the same strain. Even in other countries there were discussions that there are different types of Covid-19 strains,” he said, adding that depending on how the virus entered the country, the strain could be different; it could either be better than the previous situation or worse.

“But as of now, the current situation is worse than earlier, as it seems that even asymptomatic patients are spreading the virus. A clearer situation will be seen after 48 hours,” Dr. Fernando stressed.

According to the GMOA, contact tracing, maintaining physical distance, and increasing the number of PCR tests conducted should be done immediately to avoid any social transmission of the disease.

“It’s still too early to say whether there is a social transmission and also the contact tracing of the infected persons will be difficult unlike the previous situation,” he stressed.

Meanwhile, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had instructed relevant parties to take immediate measures to contain the spread of Covid-19, identify close associates of the affected, and to increase the number of PCR tests being conducted.

Instructions were issued to carry out random PCR tests in every district in the country as well as in institutions. Organisations where a large number of people are employed have been asked to conduct tests. However, it does appear that the factories with large workforces have neglected this responsibility.

The requirement to gazette the existing rules and regulations aimed at preventing Covid-19 was also discussed during the meeting held this week.

 Numbers still high 

Meanwhile, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the number of new cases per week has remained stable at two million for the past three weeks, with the cumulative total of over 36.7 million cases as of Friday. Over one million deaths were now reported globally, of which the majority were reported in the region of the Americas (55%), followed by Europe (23%).

In the past week, the region of the Americas, South East Asia, and Europe accounted for 91% of new cases. Five countries (namely India, the US, Brazil, Argentina, and France) reported 60% of new global cases this past week, while Israel registered the highest incidence (3,717 new cases per one million population).

Globally, the highest percentage of cases have been reported in the 25-39 age group, with approximately 50% of cases in the 25-64 age group. However, the percentage of deaths increases with age, and approximately 75% of deaths are of those aged 65 years and above, the WHO stated last week.

It further stated that in several countries, the number of new cases is rising again, and in many (most notably within the European region) the second wave is exceeding previous peaks; this can be partly attributed to enhancements in surveillance capacities over time. In other countries, a gradual decline in new cases from earlier peaks in August, for example in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru, can be seen. In India and the Philippines, the number of new cases appears to have stabilised, but they are still reporting high numbers. There are also examples of countries that have consistently shown an increasing incidence, as their first wave continues; these include Indonesia, Iraq, and Myanmar, although Indonesia is reporting a slight drop this week. South Africa and Australia are examples of countries that have successfully managed to reduce the number of new cases and have seen large reductions from earlier peaks.

As of Friday, the total Covid-19 infections confirmed so far in Sri Lanka stood at 4,504. By Thursday evening, seven arrivals from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) including five naval personnel, two others from Iran, and one from Kuwait were confirmed to have tested positive for Covid-19. The number of Covid-19 patients reported from the new cluster linked to the Minuwangoda apparel factory rose to 1,053 that night, as one factory worker and 18 contacts tested positive for the virus. Accordingly, 29 novel coronavirus infections in total were detected on Thursday. In addition, two factory workers, 11 close contacts, and three possible cases tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday, bringing the total detections for that day to 16. In the meantime, recoveries reported from the disease stand at 3,296 while the number of active cases currently under medical care reached 1,195 as of Friday, health statistics revealed.

,,LNG power plants vast area for exploration,news,"By Maheesha Mudugamuwa

The topics of renewable energy and LNG (liquefied natural gas) have resurfaced in the news yet again, with Minister of Power Dullas Alahapperuma recently stating that two LNG power plants will be constructed by the year 2023 as a solution to the prevailing power crisis in the country in the future.

He said that although discussions have been going on since 2007, not a single LNG plant has been built during the past 13 years. The proposed LNG power plants have also been mentioned in the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB)’s Long-Term Generation Expansion Plans prepared annually since 2015.

Nevertheless, so far, only one LNG power plant – the Kerawalapitiya LNG power plant with a capacity of 300 MW – has been awarded by the CEB, of which the construction is yet to commence.

In January this year, the Cabinet of Ministers approved a 300 MW LNG plant to be built in Kerawalapitiya as a joint venture between the CEB, Japan, and India, with the financial support given from Asian Development Bank (ADB). Along with this, the approved coal power plant with a capacity of 600 MW was also approved as an extension to an existing complex in the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant (Lakvijaya Power Station), partly in order to solve the looming power crisis and mainly to reduce the losses incurred by the CEB as a result of purchasing and generating high-cost diesel electricity.

According to the US Energy Information and Administration (EIA), LNG is natural gas that has been cooled to a liquid state (liquefied) – at about -260° Fahrenheit – for shipping and storage purposes. The volume of natural gas in its liquid state is about 600 times smaller than its volume in its gaseous state in a natural gas pipeline. This liquefaction process, developed in the 19th Century, makes it possible to transport natural gas to places natural gas pipelines do not reach, and also to use natural gas as a transportation fuel.

Oil and gas exploration

With plans underway to build more LNG power plants in the country, the CEB also sought the possibility of introducing indigenous natural gas in the Mannar Basin, although the determination of the quantity and the appropriate price are still to be validated.

Reportedly, oil and gas exploration was recommenced last year after three years of waiting, and the Petroleum Resources Development Secretariat (PRDS) reopened the ex-Cairn M2 block in the Mannar Basin for development and commercialisation through a limited tender offer.

As of last year, Sri Lanka had received three proposals from two consortiums and an operator based in the UK, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East.

Speaking to The Sunday Morning in earlier September, former Minister of Petroleum Resources Development Chandima Weerakkody lamented that his successors had abandoned his project and as a result, the whole process was delayed by over two years.

“Earlier, the Secretariat (PRDS) had planned to have gas production by 2023 with the existing developments of the M2 block for which we have already advertised. Then we need Total (a French oil and gas company) and Equinor (a Norwegian petroleum refining company) to interpret the existing data from JS5 and JS6 blocks in eastern Sri Lanka basin and then to decide on future steps,” he said.

As explained by Minister of Energy Udaya Gammanpila, a decision has also been taken by the Government to recommence oil and gas exploration as well as to attract more investors to the industry. He said the country has already prepared a natural gas policy to attract more investors to explore oil and gas in Sri Lanka.

Moreover, due consideration was given to the availability of natural gas in the Mannar Basin and the utilisation of natural gas as a fuel option for the power sector. The discovery of natural gas resources is still at an early stage in the Mannar Basin. However, it is learnt that high priority for local natural gas utilisation will be given when the price is competitive with foreign markets.

The development of natural gas power plants is linked with the development of necessary natural gas infrastructure to import LNG. However, the LNG import contracts are governed by “take or pay” restrictions. In addition, having a proper mix of long-term, spot, and short-term contracts for the varied demand according to the weather patterns and seasonal aspects related to ore projects should also be considered. The total present value of implementing the Base Case Plan 2020-2039 in the next 20 years is approximately $ 16,675 million, with a discount rate of 10%.

Until local gas production begins, the CEB is to call for tenders for the LNG supply next month, parallel to the construction of the power plant. Apart from the already awarded LNG tender to Lakdhanavi Ltd., the CEB is to call for tenders for the construction of the second LNG power plant in Kerawalapitiya next month.

Ground work yet to begin

When contacted by The Sunday Morning, a spokesman for LTL Holdings (Pvt.) Ltd. said the power purchasing agreement between Lakdhanavi and the CEB is yet to be signed, adding that once the agreements are finalised, the construction of the LNG power plant would begin.

The power purchasing agreement at present is at the Attorney General’s (AG) Department, he said.

Meanwhile, as learnt by The Sunday Morning, negotiations between Sri Lanka and India for the construction of a 300 MW of LNG power plant is at a standstill, as the new Government is yet to take a decision on whether or not to continue with it.

A well-informed source attached to the Ministry of Power said that several rounds of discussions took place between the two parties under the previous Government, but the new Government is yet to give its consent to the agreements reached between the two parties.

“India was keen on funding a LNG power plant of around 500 MW, but under the CEB Long-Term Energy Generation Plan, the system could accommodate only another 300 MW and therefore, several rounds of discussions were held,” the source said, adding that at present, negotiations are at a standstill as the CEB has decided to go on project tendering.

When contacted by The Sunday Morning, CEB Chairman Eng. Vijitha Herath said that negotiations had not yet begun under the new Government and the CEB is fully focused on the tendering processes.

However, yet, the unsolicited proposals (such as government-to-government) will be considered in the future if there is a request, he said.

Already delayed

As explained in CEB’s Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan, LNG-fired combined cycle power plants and associated LNG import infrastructure – 2 x 300 MW dual fuel combined cycle power plants – must be commissioned in the western region by 2022. The associated LNG importing infrastructure is to be developed on a fast track process with sufficient capacity to cater to both the new power plants and the conversion of other oil-fired combined cycle power plants in the western region. Furthermore, an additional 3 x 300 MW natural gas combined cycle power plants are expected to be commissioned by 2026 in either Kerawalapitiya or Hambantota.

Minister Alahapperuma had stated at a meeting held at the CEB last week that during the last five years, only 300 MW were added to the national grid, although the demand for electricity is growing at 6% a year.

He had said that to address the potential power crisis in the future, in line with the President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s “Vision for Prosperity” policy statement, the contribution of green and renewable energy to the country's power grid should be increased to 70% by 2030.

In this regard, CEB Chairman Eng. Herath said the construction of the already tendered LNG power plant would commence next month.

It is further learnt that the CEB is incurring a loss of around Rs. 250 million per day due to the higher electricity production cost while the annual loss of the CEB is at around Rs. 85 billion.

As explained by Eng. Herath, the CEB incurs losses as it sells a unit at around Rs. 16, while the production cost is at around Rs. 23. To reduce these losses, the CEB should go for low-cost electricity, the Chairman added.

“We are finalising the LNG projects and several other low-cost electricity projects. Unless we commence such projects, the losses incurred by the CEB cannot be reduced,” he stressed.

Furthermore, the CEB Chairman said the reason for the delay in commencing the construction of low-cost power plants was the delay in procurement processes, adding that given the present documentation speed, it would take another year to finalise the construction of the power plants.

Accordingly, the incorporation of LNG-fired power plants to the Sri Lankan power system has been considered in the Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan 2015-2034.

In preparation of the Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan 2020-2039, the present trend of LNG fuel prices was considered with the possibility of recovering the capital cost of LNG infrastructure. The option of adopting a floating storage regasification unit (FSRU) as an immediate requirement, along with the possibility of a land-based LNG terminal as a long-term solution, is considered.

However, LNG infrastructure must be established at least by 2021 in order to gain the maximum benefit of avoiding high-cost fuel oil. The combined cycle plants that are operating using oil in the western region will be converted to natural gas immediately after the facility is made available. The delays in procuring LNG infrastructure will cause the power plants to operate on oil, which would result in an enormous cost overrun and increased environmental emissions, the CEB plan explains.

The main load centre of Sri Lanka is also located in the western region. In order to minimise the transmission losses, the development of power plants closer to the load centre is identified. Therefore, the development of natural gas-operated power plants in the western region is identified as a priority, which will comply with the environmental requirements in the western region. Meanwhile, Hambantota is identified as the second location to develop natural gas power plants with its available port facilities.

Meanwhile, Minister Alahapperuma said in Parliament on Thursday (8) that the CEB has incurred a loss of Rs. 181.5 billion between 2015 and 2019. Accordingly, the CEB has incurred a loss of Rs. 2.3 billion in 2015, Rs. 14.4 billion in 2016, Rs. 47.5 billion in 2017, Rs. 31.9 billion in 2018, and Rs. 85.4 billion in 2019. The factors for the losses, as explained by Alahapperuma, included the inability of the previous governments to build new power plants during the past few years and also the failure to amend the electricity tariffs in line with the increased cost of generation.

,,Expressway Projects | Shifting lanes takes time,focus,"New construction model delays projects  
Government to absorb additional cost overruns  
Focus on 100,000 km road development projects  
RDA launches survey on delayed road projects  
 
By Maheesha Mudugamuwa

The long awaited expressway projects, the Central Expressway Project (CEP) and the Ruwanpura Expressway Project (REP), are to see further delays due to the Government’s decision to utilise Build, Operate, and Transfer (BOT) models for expressway constructions,  The Sunday Morning  learnt.

It is learnt that this decision has been taken by the Government considering the economic downturn caused due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  The Sunday Morning  further learnt that the Government’s dire financial position had not left any room to increase its capital expenditure and, worse, even to meet the budgeted expenditure next year, making the BOT model practically the only way to go ahead with the long-delayed expressway projects.

Survey conducted prior to the commencement of the construction of Section I of the CEP

However, a senior official attached to the Road Development Authority (RDA), who wished to remain anonymous, told  The Sunday Morning  that the construction of these projects would be delayed for at least another three months.

They are hopeful that the projects would somehow raise their heads from the ground next year.

The BOT model lays the least financial burden on the Treasury, but choosing an investor under the BOT model has made it difficult, especially during the economic slowdown brought about by the ongoing pandemic. The investors too are currently under stress with orders drying up, tight cash flows, and labour shortages.

Furthermore, the stretched balance sheets of the companies do not allow them the leeway to take on additional debt to finance the initial cost of construction, which BOT projects entail.

With revenue, in the form of toll revenue, flowing only after the completion of construction, these projects are the least preferred.

Nevertheless, the delay of projects is causing the Government a financial loss economically, in addition to the already incurred losses due to the delay in commissioning the projects.

As learnt by  The Sunday Morning , the Government will have to absorb billions of rupees as additional cost overruns due to the delay in commissioning Section I of the CEP during the tenure of the previous Government, and the losses would have to be covered by the Treasury.

It is further learnt that the Government had already incurred a loss of around Rs. 30 billion as a result of cost overruns from just Section I of the CEP from Kadawatha to Meerigama. Accordingly, the total cost of Section I of the CEP has now increased from around $ 158 million to $ 194 million. The RDA also had to pay an additional Rs. 8 billion as an advance payment to activate the Chinese loan.

The cost overruns have been calculated based on the price escalations of the construction materials, from the date of signing the construction contract to the date when the construction actually commenced, according to a well-informed source at the Ministry of Highways.

The 37 km Section I of the CEP from Kadawatha to Meerigama was scheduled to be constructed by a Chinese contractor at an estimated cost of around Rs. 158 billion, obtained as a loan from the Export-Import Bank of China. The construction of Section I of the CEP, which moved at a snail’s pace due to the delay in dispersing the funds of the already signed agreement covering 85% of the contract price, is yet to properly begin due to the delay on the part of the Government to meet the agreed 15% of the total loan amount.

However, the contract for Section I was signed in 2015.

The delay caused due to the inability to come to an agreement on the conditions mentioned in the loan contract, has caused a massive price escalation.

Meanwhile, the construction of Section I of the CEP between Kadawatha and Meerigama commenced last week. Accordingly, the 37 km stretch, which was undertaken by Metallurgical Corporation of China, is scheduled to be completed in four years.

Section I includes three interchanges in Gampaha, Meerigama, and Veyangoda. The construction will be done in two stages. The first stage involves the completion of five kilometres and the rest of the distance will be completed at a cost of Rs. 168.5 million.

Meanwhile, according to Highways Minister Johnston Fernando, a proposal has been presented to Cabinet to construct stretches of roads on the CEP from Pothuhera to Galagedara and from Kurunegala to Dambulla.

“We hope to complete construction work on these expressways within the next three-and-a-half years. We also fast-tracked and completed the construction work on the Matara to Hambantota stretch on the Southern Expressway within four months,” he said.

Despite Minister Fernando’s assurance, officials claimed that the projects would be delayed under the present construction models.

The construction work of the expressway was launched in 2014 and the estimated total cost was approximately Rs. 200 billion. The work was scheduled to be completed by 2018.

However, the previous Government came into power in 2015 and changed the name of the project from “Kandy Expressway” to “Central Expressway” and former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe again launched the construction of the expressway by laying a foundation stone in February 2017 with the first phase expected to be completed in mid-2019.

The first phase includes the following stages; Stage 1 – Kadawatha to Meerigama, Stage 2 – Meerigama to Kurunegala, Stage 3 – Pothuhera to Galagedara – Kandy, and Stage 4 – Kurunegala to Dambulla. In addition, there is a link road starting from Ambepussa to Meerigama that comes under Stage 2.

Stage 3 of the project starts from the Hiripathwella Grama Niladhari Division (GND) of the Polgahawela Divisional Secretariat Division (DSD) and ends at the Palu Kopiwatta GND of the Tumpane (Galagedara) DSD. Again, Stage 4 of the project starts at the Theliyagonna GND of the Kurunegala DSD and runs through DSDs Mallawapitiya, lbbagamuwa, Mawathagama, Rideegama, Melsiripura, and Galewela, and ends at the Mirisgoniya junction of the Dambulla DSD (crossing A06), according to the RDA.

On the other hand, the REP, which has also been discussed at length during cabinet meetings this year, is also yet to commence. The REP too was supposed to be converted into a BOT model and the tender documents were being finalised by the Highways Ministry last month. As such, the project was to be commenced soon after the contractors were finalised, without any delay.

However, as learnt by  The Sunday Morning , the funds for the project had not yet been finalised and the estimates were to be done after concluding the tender process.

In July, the Cabinet officially removed the Chinese contractor from Section I of the REP (from Kahathuduwa to Ingiriya) and decided to go ahead with local funding.

As confirmed earlier by Highways Ministry Secretary Ranjith Premasiri, the local funds are to be raised through state banks and the Ministry of Highways is yet to lay out a mechanism for the purpose of funding.

Accordingly, the Cabinet has removed the Chinese contractor, China National Technical Import and Export Corporation (CNTIC), which was awarded the contract to construct a 26.3 km Section I of the REP from Kahathuduwa to Ingiriya in 2016 by the REP.

As per the cabinet memorandum dated 26 July 2016, CNTIC was the proposed contractor for Section I of the REP. The Cabinet of Ministers approved a proposal presented by the Highways Minister to proceed with the expressway constructions using the funds of local banks and the services of local construction companies.

The REP from Kahathuduwa to Pelmadulla to Ratnapura (73.9 km) has been divided into three sections for implementation purposes. Section I is from Kahathuduwa to Ingiriya (26.3 km), Section II is from Ingiriya to Ratnapura (26.2 km), and Section III is from Ratnapura to Pelmadulla (21.4 km).

 100,000 km road project 

Despite the construction of the expressway projects being delayed, the RDA, as per the directions given by President Goatabaya Rajapaksa, is now continuing the 100,000 km road constructions project with the aim of completing it by 2024, as promised in the national policy framework “Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour”.

The President stated that new bridges will be built replacing hanging, wooden plank, and small bridges. The construction of 8,000 km of roads has commenced and 400 km of it has already been completed in the last few months.

He stressed that no room should be left for interruptions and delays in the construction process.

“The supervision of the construction should be carried out by both government representatives and contractors and no subcontractors are allowed,” the President noted.

The prioritisation of the President’s brainchild, the 100,000 km project, was questioned by some transport experts who claimed that it was a question of prioritising national interests. They also noted that the economic loss caused by the delay in constructing national expressways and the Light Rail Transit (LRT) system would be much higher than delaying some other road construction projects.

According to the statistics of the RDA, the grand total of the national highways in Sri Lanka (“A”, “B’, and “E” Class Roads) is 12,496.337 km.

 Survey on delayed projects 

Meanwhile, the RDA has launched a survey to identify the number of road development projects that have not been completed yet due to construction delays. The survey had begun following Minister Fernando’s request last week to look into the delayed projects and to evaluate the possibilities of taking legal action against those who have wilfully delayed the projects.

Addressing the progress review meeting of the Priority Road Project (iRoad), implemented by the RDA last week, Minister Fernando said the road projects would be taken over by the RDA if construction is delayed and the road has not been completed on time.

The Minister further stated that the contractors who are postponing the construction will not be involved in future projects of the Ministry.

The Minister also instructed Ministry Secretary Premasiri to submit a report on the companies that are still delaying the construction of roads, especially those whose construction work had not been completed on time. The construction of some roads was scheduled to be completed in 2018 but had not been completed yet, the Minister said.

 By Skandha Gunasekara 

The Government’s plans for the tourism sector are to be pushed back with the arrival of a contingent of 44,000 Russian tourists scheduled in November being postponed indefinitely,  The Sunday Morning  learnt.

The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) President Sanath Ukwatte told  The Sunday Morning  that there have been many inquiries for bookings to Sri Lanka due to the lack of Covid-19-free countries, adding: “There have been many inquiries, but no bookings as such yet.

“We were one of the few countries that had controlled the pandemic quite well, and tourists around the world don’t really have that many options in that regard. However, it is still hard for us to determine how many bookings we will have.”

He said that the opening of the airport would allow the travel industry to kickstart operations with overseas tourists.

“The first step is to fix a date for when the airport would open for foreign tourists. After that, we can work on informing stakeholders and estimate a number.

“We must advertise and promote Sri Lanka tourism, and we have to work with travel agents as well as our customers.

“At the moment, I don’t want to speculate on how many tourists we can expect as soon as the airports open. As another cluster has been found, we have to wait till that is contained and things normalise.

“These kinds of situations can be recurring, as what we are facing globally is unprecedented in modern times. So, we don’t know how long it would take for this new cluster to be brought under control; also, whether we may need curfew and lockdown to contain it.”

 Sri Lanka attractive right now 

He noted that the majority of tourists who visit during the end of the year are from regions experiencing winter during those times, such as Europe.

“Normally, the inquiries during the winter season come from European countries and Russia. To avoid the cold winter, they want to come to Sri Lanka and spend some time here.

“But right now, of course, I think there is a big demand for people to travel here because there are not many countries for them to go to. If we can open the airport, provided the health officials are happy and if they give us the proper protocol to follow, then we can ascertain how many bookings we can expect.”

He said they expected that Sri Lanka being given the “All Clear” pass by the World Tourism Council would assist in attracting more visitors.

“Also, the fact that Sri Lanka got the “All Clear” pass from the World Tourism Council has resulted in so many countries saying Sri Lanka is a safe destination. So, there would be increased demand under the circumstances.”

Ukwatte then reiterated that that a date for opening of the airport would help finalise plans for prospective tourists, stating: “However, nothing can be done until a decision is taken to open the airport. That will be the first step.”

 Tourism sector geared and ready 

Meanwhile, Minister of Tourism Prasanna Ranatunga said the Government was in the process of ensuring the country was only a few steps away from restarting the tourism sector as soon as it gets the nod from the health services.

“We are working day and night to ensure that everything is prepared and the country is ready to open its doors to international tourism as soon as we’ve brought the Covid-19 outbreak under control. But we can’t give a definite time and date on when we can open for tourism; the Government is making all the necessary arrangements.”

One of the new initiatives taken by the Government is to introduce an app for tourists.

“A presentation was done a few days ago but it wasn’t made public given the circumstances. The app will be done by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA). It will show the itinerary of a tourist – exactly where he is bound and what hotels he is staying at. In addition, the Covid-19 test results of each tourist would be available on the app. The app has been developed and is awaiting official launch.”

In addition, he said the incumbent Government wants to provide tourists with health insurance which would also cover Covid-19, stating: “We also want to provide health insurance for all tourists including cover for Covid-19. We’ve informed insurance companies to provide us with their input on this mechanism. We are also making arrangements to bring down tourists in groups.”

He then revealed that the Cabinet had already approved a large tour group of Russians for November this year.

“We had made plans to bring down 44,000 Russians in November. The plan received the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers about three weeks ago. But all this was subject to the green light from the health services.”

Nevertheless, he said the recent coronavirus developments in the country had pushed back the Russian tour group. “That Russian group arrival was postponed. But we are also in discussion with corona ‘green’ countries for further tourism opportunities.”

Minister Ranatunga too affirmed that the entire industry was awaiting authorisation by the health authorities to start their activities.

“Before tourism in the country can be opened, we have to complete the repatriation of Sri Lankan expatriates,” he said, adding: “The process has slowed in the past few weeks due to the quarantine centres reaching its capacities. But once the quarantine centres are freed up, the repatriation process will be swiftly completed. Only after it has been completed can we begin welcoming tourists.”

Furthermore, the Health Ministry informed  The Sunday Morning  that there wasn’t a requirement for an islandwide lockdown at present.

“Currently, there is no need to lockdown the country, as we are managing the situation. There is no need for islandwide curfew either,” Ministry of Health Chief Epidemiologist Dr. Sudath Samarweera told  The Sunday Morning.

,,Is Sri Lanka unlucky or unprepared?,business,"Some time back, a friend of mine died in a motorcycle accident. I consoled myself thinking it was pure misfortune. However, upon visiting the location of the accident, I discovered my friend had ridden his bike without a safety helmet. Needless to say, if he hadn’t met with the accident, regardless of whether he was wearing a helmet or not, he would’ve still been amongst us. However, if he had worn a helmet, it is likely that he would’ve survived the accident.

Most incidents in life, or even in the economy, can be seen through two lenses – of misfortune and mismanagement (in its positive variation, these can be interpreted as good fortune or as the results of hard work and smart decisions). It is embedded in Sri Lankan culture to interpret most unfavourable events in life through the lens of misfortune. However, a deeper dive into the root causes of unfortunate incidents often emphasises lapses of management.

A sudden uptick in Covid-19 cases can also be viewed by society through these two lenses. As individuals, isn’t it the appropriate time to question if we followed the simple steps of wearing a face mask, washing our hands, maintaining social distance, and taking precautionary measures to avoid greater misfortune?

On the broader picture of public policy; have we increased our testing capacity, have we followed the right testing strategy, and have we been conducting random testing? These are questions we should ask ourselves before jumping to any conclusions.

However, a combination of mismanagement and misfortune is deadly, and these two often complement each other. Whether it’s misfortune or mismanagement, the consequences for citizens would be very serious both from a public health perspective and from an economic angle.

One main lesson Covid-19 has taught us is that only self-control and self-discipline can contain the virus, not state control. The state can only play a facilitatory role, and the impact on public health and our economy worsens with each blanket policy decision.

When we look at the events over the last five to six years, an unaccounted cost of mismanagement is throwing away resources and opportunities that could have been utilised during hard times of misfortune.

For example, think of a cricket team which is chasing a total, and loses half their wickets due to the frontline batsmen playing careless shots. However, the team ends up losing only by two runs due to a brave fightback by the lower order batsmen, which took the team to the brink of an unlikely victory. Should we say the team was unlucky because it got agonisingly close and lost by only two runs, or should we blame the carelessness of the batsmen at the top, without whom the team would have presumably ended up winning the match?

When we look back at our recent history, in 2015-2016, the Central Bank bond fiasco affected our financial markets to an extent; in 2016, the drought greatly affected Sri Lanka’s economic prospects; in 2018, we had a constitutional crisis; this was followed by the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks which further shattered hopes of any economic recovery; we had the Digana riots and social media blockages in between; in 2020, we are still in the middle of a global pandemic. Some of these negative shocks are due to mismanagement, and some events are due to misfortune. But it is undeniable that we are hindered by the mismanagement of our misfortunes.

However, all the misfortune and mismanagement over the last few decades now appear to be funnelling down to a serious economic shock. The uncertainty of Covid-19 and its impact at the global scale have made it the right ingredient to stir up a storm for Sri Lanka.

 Mismanagement and misfortune of exports 

Covid-19 hit our exports badly on all fronts. As our export markets were affected by falling consumption, our supply chains for exports were interrupted during the first wave of Covid. Since then, however, our exports have been on the rise to reach pre-Covid levels. However, our apparel sector is one major industry that was badly hit by Covid-19 just at the start of this year – a time we need exports the most.

There is talk in society that the recent Covid-19 cluster is viewed as a result of both misfortune and mismanagement. However, we as a country cannot be forgiven for the mismanagement of our export sector over the years. Our mismanagement of exports backed by a system of unnecessary and excessive regulations on exports continues to handicap our export potential. According to a study conducted by Verite Research in 2018, registering as an exporter is an extensive process. The example they provided is of the coconut industry, where the process adds three to four weeks in time taken to register, in addition to the time taken penetrating regulatory barriers that stand in the way of easy registration, only to prolong the process even further, continuing all the way to the point of customs.

The added unnecessary import restrictions further hurt Sri Lanka’s export potential with higher tariffs on imported raw materials for export processing making matters worse and Sri Lanka’s exports uncompetitive on the global stage.

The intention of protecting local industries by imposing tariffs has made our own local industries uncompetitive and has forced consumers to bear the cost of inefficiencies. As a result, local industries are neither productive for export nor competitive, and we are back at square one.

Our mismanagement has caused us to restrict our exports only to a few sectors and we have placed too many export eggs in the apparel basket.

 Mismanagement and misfortune of our debt sustainability 

Covid-19 has had a direct impact on our debt sustainability. As we have highlighted multiple times, servicing debt of nearly $4 billion till 2025 is a mammoth task. Our debt servicing cost has exploded to a whopping 107% of our annual revenue, and our annual revenue is declining as a percentage of GDP over the years.

The Government’s generous tax cut offered at the end of last year is expected to significantly reduce tax revenue for 2020. The Government assured us that we are in a position to service all our debts. However, that can be only done by borrowing money from other lenders and servicing the existing debt. Even if it is possible, it won’t provide a permanent solution due to the unsustainability of our debt.

If Sri Lanka had built the right economic foundations with proper social security safety nets and policies to boost competition and productivity with a firm understanding of economic fundamentals, we would never have reached this dangerous juncture.

By and large, we could also have navigated or totally avoided most of the misfortunes we are facing at the moment. Our mismanagement is what has made us believe that we are unfortunate. Unfortunately, the degree of mismanagement through which we have survived so far is more than we can afford. Therefore, we have now reached such a precarious position that we simply cannot afford to face any further misfortune!

,,Introduction of REITs a progressive move by SEC,business,"Real Estate Investment Trusts (popularly referred to as REITs) are a popular asset class in economies with mature primary and secondary real estate markets. Its introduction in Sri Lanka is a progressive move by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (CSESL) underlying the huge growth in the domestic real estate market and creating a key tool to aid its future growth.

 What is a REIT? 

A REIT is essentially like a mutual fund of property assets. Like a mutual fund, a pool of investors invests into a funding vehicle (in this case, the REIT). The REIT then uses these funds to invest in a pool of real estate assets such as residential projects, commercial projects, commercial rental property, malls, warehouses, and industrial developments, to name a few. The REIT earns a return either through rental income on properties rented out (such as office blocks and malls) or through profits from the completion of a residential or commercial project. Just like a mutual fund, these earnings are then either paid out to the unitholders of the REIT or invested in other property assets.

 Why is it useful for investors? 

Generally, real estate investments, by their nature, require big-ticket investment sizes and do not offer the investor much diversification of risk. For example, an individual investor may want to invest Rs. 100 million in real estate. They can buy a few apartments, or a few offices as an investment. This not only requires a significant amount of capital investment, but it also exposes the investor to the risk that a particular apartment or office may have a problem or may be a bad buy. Since they only have a few real estate assets, one bad asset can significantly impact the return on the portfolio.

The other challenge with real estate investments is that disposal or sale of assets can be time-consuming, tedious, and often the market can be illiquid when the investor most needs cash. This low liquidity potential makes investors wary of locking funds into a real estate investment versus other, more liquid investments like FDs (fixed deposits) or stocks.

A REIT helps the investor get around both these problems.

Firstly, as an investor, a REIT allows one to buy a certain number of “units” or “shares” in the REIT. As a REIT is invested in a variety of real estate assets, the investor thus diversifies his risk across a much larger pool of assets. This makes it easy for even small investors to diversify with lower risk exposure in real estate. The investor thus theoretically can enjoy the upside of a real estate investment, while mitigating some of the downside risks through diversification. Thus, the aforementioned investor now has Rs. 100 million invested in a small share of a considerable portfolio of apartments and offices. The risk of one of these apartments having a problem barely has any effect on their overall return.

Secondly, the “units” or “shares” in a REIT can be bought and sold just like a stock or like units in a mutual fund. If our investor needs funds, they could sell their shares in the REIT immediately at the market value on that particular date. They would be able to cash out immediately and enjoy the returns up to that date.

 Why is it useful for real estate developers? 

Firstly, by pooling together large groups of investors, REITs allow developers access to a much larger pool of capital than they usually have. This greatly helps assuage one of the largest problems of a developer in an extremely cash-intensive industry.

Also, REITs are often able to act as “anchor” investors in the early stages of real estate projects. Purchasing a certain percentage of the apartments or units in a development at an early stage increases the viability of the project and allows the developer to reduce their risk.

Finally, an often-overlooked factor is that REITs greatly help incentivise developers to build more commercial and rental developments. Generally, office and shopping complexes are risky for developers as there are very few actual buyers, and the developer has to earn their return through managing rentals. Apart from not being a core competency for most developers, this significantly increases the project payback period and thus increases the financial cost and reduces the viability of such projects. As a result, many developers avoid building rental assets.

REITs act as key players here as they often purchase malls and office blocks, and are happy to earn long-term rental income and pass this on to their investors. This gives developers a clear exit and encourages them to develop more rental-based projects.

 REITs in Sri Lanka 

The REIT is the only new product launched by the CSE after 23 years, the last being the introduction of corporate bonds in 1997.

The spiralling property prices in Sri Lanka has made it a challenge for average citizens to finance real estate investments, which means a significant proportion of the population will not benefit from the appreciation of property and infrastructure development values.

Introduced by the SEC together with relevant stakeholders, the regulatory framework has been set in place taking into consideration the local environment in which it will operate. The rules set out by the SEC are an extension of the current Unit Trust Code, and came into effect on 31 July 2020 in the form of a gazette notification.

In order to promote transparency and to distribute ownership among people of Sri Lanka, REITs are only allowed as listed REITs on the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE). The listing has three primary requirements, namely that the building should be fully completed, there should be 20% occupancy, and it should be an income-generating project.

The new regulation has offered real estate developers and owners of fully completed properties in Sri Lanka the capability of converting their properties to a REIT which will offer the general public the opportunity to invest and thereby benefit from any increase in property values.

Specific provisions have been included for the verification of title and valuation of the property that will form part of the assets. Among the requirements is the mandatory distribution of approximately 90% of the income to unitholders, which is currently not a requirement for any of the listed entities.

Furthermore, due to the availability of the pass-through tax mechanism on unit trusts, REITs could also be a viable business concept to Sri Lanka that will open new horizons for entrepreneurs to take the real estate industry to greater heights.

REITs will give a higher dividend and a relatively stable income through long leases with regulation to protect investors. The rules, however, could change in the future based on industry requirements.

In conclusion, it would be ideal if the stamp duty was reduced or removed at least until REITs became popular in Sri Lanka.

,,The locally made green traffic and fitness solution,business,"First Sri Lankan electric bike plans 1,000 sales in first year   
By Uwin Lugoda

The vehicle industry has always been dominated by fossil fuels, but in the past few years, we have seen a significant push towards companies coming up with electric automobiles. However, it is not solely the companies that opt for electric automobiles; more consumers make the switch each year due to lower fuel costs, environmental stewardship, and energy independence.

This move for greener transport has also been making its way into the global bicycle segment, with the standard pedal bike and even motorbikes rapidly being replaced by electric/smart bikes. The global e-bike market is projected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 9.01% to reach $ 38.6 billion by 2025 from $ 21.1 billion in 2018, according to international research.

This trend has now made its way to Sri Lanka in the form of Rhoda, the country’s first locally built electric bicycle. Themed “Cycling Redefined”, Rhoda was officially unveiled to the media on 24 September.

Speaking to The Sunday Morning Business, Rhoda CEO and Co-Founder Eyas Fazul said that Rhoda’s goal is to revolutionise mobility in Sri Lanka, focusing on the three key principles of convenience, sustainability, and value for money. He explained that they will first start by redefining cycling for the average commuter with Rhoda AT, Sri Lanka’s first electric smart bicycle.

The Rhoda AT is equipped with a specifically engineered motor and a battery that adds two more riding modes to a conventional bicycle; the “Power Assist” mode (up to 60 km on a full charge), best defined as an invisible push while peddling which significantly reduces the effort needed for momentum while still putting in a healthy exercise, and the “Cruise” mode (up to 30 km on a full charge), where the bicycle transforms into a safer motorcycle through its twist throttle.

The product also claims the title of Sri Lanka’s first smart bicycle. Its integration with a smartphone enables biometric authentication through the phone’s fingerprint sensor. It also enables face recognition to access the bike thanks to the smartphone HUD (heads-up display). Through a dedicated app, it allows the integrated lights and locking mechanism that can be controlled through the app for unprecedented safety and security.

Fazul stated that the ideation and conceptualisation of the product started in 2017, with the beta prototype having been completed in June 2020 thanks to his other two Co-founders, Head of Design Lee Bazalgette and Head of Production Fazul Mowjood. He explained that he had always been passionate about riding, especially old café racer-type motorcycles; however, his shift to electric mobility came three years ago when he saw an electric kick scooter that had a range of around 60 km in one charge while attending a solar conference in Singapore.

“It immediately dawned on me that this, a contextually designed electric mobility product, is the solution for the commuting problems in Sri Lanka, especially considering how bad rush hour commutes can be in our cities islandwide.”

Fazul presented Rhoda as the solution to the average person’s travel woes, on account of the average speed during rush hour on a Rhoda being 19 km/h, in contrast to 10 km/h, which the average commute in a car, three-wheeler, or bus, reducing a 20 km commute time from 120 minutes to 70 minutes. He went on to state that a fully charged Rhoda has plenty of power for an average daily commute to work (30 km), run errands (10 km), and even meet friends (20 km) on Power Assist mode. Moreover, he stated that choosing to travel in a Rhoda AT would result in less one-person cars coming into the city. This would have a net positive effect on society with less congested roads, which would help other public transport commuters and city officials streamline traffic better.

“Riding a Rhoda also has a significant impact on the environment with the reduction of our daily individual carbon footprint created due to commutes, reducing the CO2 emissions of 7 kg in cars or 2.3 kg in three-wheelers to only 1.1 kg in a Rhoda, which can be further reduced if charged through solar, which is sustainable for the planet.”

He stated that by having the option to pedal in a Rhoda, there is a significant physical and also mental health benefit associated with it. When riding to work on Power Assist mode, the bike is set to act as a sort of exercise, with analysis showing a 30% reduction in calories burnt, compared to cycling on a conventional bicycle amounting to 495 calories.

“Finding time for exercise means we would need additional hours in a 24-hour day, in the midst of trying to balance work and life. However, the constant movement, breaking away from a sedentary lifestyle that Rhoda provides, acts as its own form of exercise,” Fazul added.

Speaking on the mental aspect of Rhoda, Fazul stated that there is countless research that links slow, passive commuting, such as being stuck behind a wheel or in public transport, to stress-related physical and mental illnesses like heart disease, anxiety, and even depression. It has also been shown that opting for an active commute, like walking or cycling, leads to a reduction in being prone to such illnesses and a boost in productivity due to increased blood circulation to the brain and the positive hormonal effects that occur when exercising; a more sustainable lifestyle for us.

Finally he pointed out that Rhoda also has a positive effect on the wallet of the user; where an average commute costs around Rs. 15 per kilometre by car, Rs. 35 per kilometre by three-wheeler, Rs. 6.5 per kilometre by motorcycle, Rs. 4 per kilometre by bus, and even Rs. 2 per kilometre by train, the cost of Rhoda is Rs. 0.2 per kilometre, offering unparalleled economic benefits to transportation.

“In summary, Rhoda is the more convenient, sustainable and economical, option for mobility and transportation.”

According to Fazul, the Rhoda AT was designed around the ideals of the daily commuter, starting with the step-through design similar to a scooter that allows someone to get on and off a Rhoda easily, in a well-ironed shirt and trouser, saree, or even more traditional outfits like a sarong.

Furthermore, other attractive features include the integrated locking mechanism that allows one to park a Rhoda anywhere, locking it to light poles and metal railing, and the integrated headlights and taillights for cycling at night after those long days at office.

He stated that these factors, alongside the bike’s ability to traverse a diverse range of terrains, including sandy beaches and inner gravel roads, make the switch to Rhoda attractive to a vast target market.

The company currently has two models, the AT which stands for All-Terrain and the AT SS which is the Stainless Steel variant of the AT, both having the same specifications. The two models are also customisable with a multitude of colours and accessory options.

For their first 50 pre-orders, they are giving each buyer a special edition of the Rhoda, called the Founder Edition, where they offer a free custom mural of the consumer’s liking. These orders are set to start delivering in the first quarter of 2021.

Fazul stated that most of their manufacturing is currently in-house, but they do source some items from local and international suppliers who manufacture based on their design specifications. He explained that iron and steel are some of the key materials in Rhoda, and due to this, they have partnered with suppliers who source them from a couple of countries such as India and China.

“Rhoda AT is for any populated city and is not limited to just Colombo. Congested cities like Kandy, Kurunegala, and Ratnapura; cycling cities such as Jaffna and Trincomalee; and even coastal cities like Galle and Matara are perfect for our product. Rhoda is designed and made in Sri Lanka, for Sri Lankans first.”

He stated that the current Government is looking to promote a cycling culture for daily commuting purposes. Therefore, Rhoda’s target is to have at least 1,000 Rhodies (Rhoda riders) on the streets of Sri Lanka in the first year of their production.",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,The locally made green traffic and fitness solution,business,0,1602390079,0,100653,,
,,Fixing Colombo’s traffic issue,business,"Anyone who drives in Colombo for even a few minutes runs the very real possibility of hitting or getting hit by something – a motorcycle, a tuk tuk, a person, a bus, another car or van, or even a tree; or get stuck in traffic that turns a 20-minute drive into a 90-minute nightmare. That’s how badly our roads have been designed.
There’s no point in wringing our hands like naughty children and saying there’s too much traffic. Until our public transport system – trains and buses – is brought up to a satisfactory level, people have to get to school and to work. Via the roads – they don’t have wings to fly.

Traffic isn’t just a nuisance, it’s a major economic issue that affects investment, productivity, and efficiency. And it keeps a lot of angry commuters in a bad mood permanently.

So let’s look at what the problems are and what needs to be done.

Traffic congestion is only at junctions. Roads have sufficient capacity. It’s a myth that we don’t have sufficient road space in Colombo. If the traffic would flow, vehicles would get from point A to point B and then be off the roads. But when junctions are badly designed, they become clogged with traffic, resulting in many times the number of vehicles than necessary remaining on the roads.

What’s wrong with our junctions?

•Poor construction of left and right-turn lanes at junctions forcing turning vehicles to stop for long periods

•Poor calibration of traffic lights resulting in left-turning vehicles being stopped needlessly

•Left-turn lanes and right-turn lanes are mostly not separated from straight lanes, resulting in vehicles hopping lanes and creating clogs

•Roundabouts being poorly designed

•Poor training of traffic police

•Political interference in the smooth flow of traffic, with traffic police giving priority to VIP convoys carrying minor politicians

•Poor construction of bus stops, resulting in buses stopping partially or fully on the roads and at junctions to pick up passengers, resulting in traffic blockage

•Poor construction of parking spots, resulting in traffic congestion due to improper parking and reversing out of parking slots

•Tuk tuk parks being located at junctions resulting in accidents or congestion as they move in and out

•Religious statues blocking the line of sight of motorists

Practical solutions

•Separate the running lanes with a small curb – low cost, rapid execution

•Calibrate the traffic lights properly – zero cost; how hard can this be?

•Rationalise the design of roundabouts. Just because the British built them in a certain way a hundred years ago doesn’t mean we have to keep them

•Have professionals train traffic policemen

•Move tuk tuk parks away from junctions. This needs politicians with courage

•Separate bus stops from the road with a curb – low cost, rapid execution

•Relocate existing religious statues to alternative sites 50 metres away from the junctions

•Issue orders that only convoys of the President, Prime Minister, Speaker, Chief Justice, and Commanders of Armed Forces should be allowed

•Think three-dimensional. Build short, low-cost, single-lane or double-lane flyovers at critical junctions. But don’t bankrupt the country doing it. Simple flyovers really don’t cost much, once you cut out the corruption

•Go underground. Sometimes, short underground tunnels at junctions can be less costly than flyovers

•Plant many more new trees and get rid of trees that block traffic. But don’t go chopping down any 200-year-old trees

•Ensure that city planners include sufficient parking when approving multiple high-rise buildings, shopping malls, etc.

•Go back to the drawing board where schools are concerned and figure out how parents can be provided sufficient parking to pick up kids from Royal College, Ladies College, St. Joseph’s College, Ananda College, and all of the big schools in Colombo. These cause daily blocks in the morning and afternoon

Background

Due to a variety of factors such as a rise in the purchasing power of the middle-income socioeconomic groups, greater credit availability, relative price reductions, and an increase in production of the vehicles used, the last few decades saw a significant increase in the number of motor vehicles in developing countries. The growing availability of cars has facilitated greater personal mobility, which has, in combination with population growth in urban areas, contributed to a rise in congestion, and the reduction in the number of people per household.

Congestion interferes with the economic efficiency of a city, as it adds extra costs that increase the expense and harm the growth of all activities. Cities have to be competitive both nationally and internationally in a globalised world like today, with customers increasingly demanding, and there are numerous choices offering advantages to investors. In order to do this, the different kinds of costs, such as transport-related costs of time of travel, energy usage, the amount of air pollution, and the number of accidents, must be taken into account and minimised.

The most obvious effect of congestion is an increase in travel time, particularly during peak periods, which is well above those in smaller towns. The slow circulation rate often exasperates drivers and creates violent behaviour.

Since multiple choices are made around the world, a city with serious congestion problems will drive investors away, although other significant conditions may be favourable. While traffic congestion might not be the only cause, it may still play a major role in the exodus from traditional city centres for better performance conditions.

Congestion can make the lifestyle of a city unsustainable in the medium and long term. The synergy that can result from the concentration of cities’ services and opportunities can be cancelled by excessive travel times, fuel consumption, and pollution. More and more people will want to flee from this lifestyle and travel elsewhere in a situation marked by growing difficulties and dangers to public health. In short, pollution and its consequences slowly challenge cities’ sustainability.

Whilst billions of rupees will strengthen our urban transport infrastructure and bring it to international standards, if road and travel actions continue to deteriorate, the benefits of such investments will be greatly diminished.

Capital investment (low)

1. Improve traffic light management system

Traffic control systems (TCMs) can be very effective in optimising road efficiency by adjusting the timing of road lights in real time to meet the demands. If the lights are all synchronised to meet demand, “blocking back” (vehicles kept in interconnections) will mitigate the effects of the grid blocking. Traffic planners also can create and design plans for different situations (e.g. an arterial incident) that are then automatically loaded into the TCM.

2. Track road conditions using CCTV

The use of CCTV at road intersections enables traffic managers to detect crashes, impacts, and other congestion causes. This will ensure traffic managers receive advancing alerts of issues that affect their network, combined with excellent contact networks with traffic police, and major road users (including airports, trains, retail parks). Furthermore, each mounted CCTV camera must meet the minimum specifications to facilitate compliance. Illegal stationing of vehicles and waiting obstructs the flow of traffic and limits the capacity of intersections. Unlawful interconnections where a yellow box occurs can lead to grid blockages across a wide area of the network. Violating speed limits, red light jumps, or restricted area riding can lead to collisions, accidents, and people’s inability to walk or ride, or to encourage children to do so without accompanying them.

3. Enforce current laws on road transport

The enforcement of traffic laws in Sri Lanka is done in an ad hoc manner that fails to deter errant motorists. The assistance of CCTV is required to regularise enforcement, with traffic fine notices to be sent to the addresses of vehicle owners.

4. Enhance bus perception

Although public transport is vigorously promoted, car ownership growth will continue as a result of changing ages in our society. The enhancement of comfort and safety levels of bus and rail transport is badly needed.

5. Expand parking areas

Whatever happened to the many multi-storey parking garages that were mooted over the last 30 years? These have great profit potential for investors, if the land is made available by the government, provincial government, or local government.

Exclusive lanes and streets for mass transit

Bus-only lane

The low cost of implementation of bus lanes depends on drivers’ readiness to comply. Discipline cannot always be imposed on the user. Sometimes a systematic violation of the restrictions results in invalidating the measure.

Separated bus lanes

Separated bus lanes are similar to bus-only lanes as they are for the exclusive passage of bulk vehicles, but the difference is that between the lanes and the area allotted to other vehicles there is a physical barrier. This barrier prohibits the entry of other vehicles, which enables buses to run more freely. Divided bus lanes are much more complicated and costly than bus lanes as they require exclusive land. Private transportation in some cases must be substantially limited and major expropriations are necessary in other cases, but the reported net benefits support their introduction and inclusion as a basic criterion for the design of transport networks.

Capital investment (medium)

1. Improve cycling infrastructure

Cycling to work is an interesting option, but has some drawbacks – safety, rain, scorching sun. But other Asian nations have managed it. So should we.

2. Improve bus services

We need more buses and better buses. Enough said.

3. Develop and refine park-and-ride

Rail and bus coupled with ample parking at railway and bus stations. What could be simpler? May need a significant amount of land acquisition though.

4. Use inbound flow control

Sophisticated ICT systems exist in other countries, that can be designed by our own young ICT professionals. Use them.

5. Rationalise distribution and deliveries

Our roads are too often blocked by heavy vehicles loading and unloading, from cement mixers to containers. The roads around the Port of Colombo are particularly troublesome. We need to take a look at best practices in cities such as Singapore, where industrial traffic is routed on different roads and at different times to ensure that rush hour traffic is not disrupted.

Capital investment (high)

1. Existing rail network

See our last week’s column on optimising usage of the existing rail network, with Greater Colombo already having 92 railway stations. Improve the tracks; expand the stations; and put better, faster, and larger trains on the track.

2. New light rail

A contentious political issue right now, but it should be explored for areas of Greater Colombo that aren’t covered by the existing rail network.

3. Expressways

An interesting project is being carried out to connect the Colombo Port City/Fort area with the expressway network, connecting at the Kelani Bridge. It remains to be seen how much of the existing traffic will use this. Much depends on whether it will be toll free or have a high toll that pushes it out of the reach of motorists.

Conclusion

The problem of congestion is too severe and far-reaching to assume that unilateral, unpredictable, knee-jerk, or voluntary steps will mitigate it.

On the contrary, maintaining control of urban living standards and guaranteeing minimum sustainability requires a multidisciplinary effort that involves improving driving habits, providing better infrastructure, and measures to manage traffic (supply side management) and rationalising road use (demand management).

In the end, traffic management isn’t rocket science. It’s something that many megacities handle quite efficiently, while many others don’t. Simply implement the best practices of the successful megacities and the traffic will flow.",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Fixing Colombo’s traffic issue,business,0,1602390393,0,100658,,
,,Could state-funded maternity leave cushion Covid-19 job losses?,business,"Subhashini Abeysinghe and Verité Executive Director and Head of Research Dr. Nishan De Mel Photo SAMAN ABESIRIWARDANA

Career or family? It’s an unfortunate dilemma faced by most women as a result of unspoken discrimination against female job applicants.

This discrimination mainly stems from the corporate stigma surrounding maternity leave, the cost and burden of which must currently be borne exclusively by the company. This has traditionally deterred companies from hiring women employees at the interview stage itself, and has long been considered one of the biggest roadblocks women face when starting their professional lives.

In order to curb this bias, 129 countries from around the world have already adopted policies to aid corporations by helping them fund maternity leave benefits (MLBs). Out of these 129, 96 states fully support MLBs while the remaining 33 partially support MLBs.

However in Sri Lanka, private employers still bear the entire cost of MLBs for a period of at least 12 weeks, making it more expensive to hire women than men, thereby leading to discrimination against female job applicants. This issue adds to Sri Lanka’s female unemployment rate which has persistently been two times that of the male unemployment rate.

An analysis done on the extent of disadvantages women face due to not having state-supported MLBs, showcased that this gap in unemployment rates is worse for women of child-bearing age – they are 3.8 times more likely to be unemployed than men of the same age. The analysis done by Verité Research, a private think tank that provides strategic analyses for Asia, and YouLead, United States Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Youth Employment and Business Start-up Programme, was presented to the media on 30 September.

During the media event, Verité Executive Director and Head of Research Dr. Nishan De Mel listed out these disadvantages faced by women in that particular age group. He explained that women in the 20-40 age group secure only 30% of jobs in the private sector, compared to 45% in the public sector.

The analysis also showcased that women in this age group are 6.6 times more likely to be unemployed that women outside the age group.

“Requiring these private companies to shoulder the entire cost of MBLs makes hiring women in the 20-40 age group more expensive. Therefore, women in this age group who are seeking employment outside the public sector are at a disadvantage,” said Dr. De Mel.

He stated the Sri Lankan Government can reduce this discrimination against women and boost female economic participation by shifting the cost of MLBs from the employer to the state. He explained that the state can reduce these disadvantages by allowing entities to set off the cost of MLBs against their taxes.

In fact, MLBs were accounted for in the 2019 Budget, which included a proposal for the state to partially support MLBs through tax deductibility, but the proposal was not implemented. Subsequently, the tax cuts implemented at the beginning of 2020 were worth Rs. 52 billion – 10 times the value of tax concessions necessary to support MLBs. Yet the opportunity to structure these tax concessions in a manner that would fund MLBs was lost.

According to Dr. De Mel, this move would have many positive outcomes for both society and the economy. The analysis predicted that increased female participation in the labour force will increase income flow into households and cushion post-Covid-19 job losses.

“Tax relief for MLBs cost less than other welfare initiatives. Based on 2018 data, we estimated the annual cost of MLBs to be Rs. 4.2 billion. This amounts to approximately 0.25% of tax revenue. In contrast, Samurdhi subsidies amounted to 2.3%, Rs. 39.2 billion of tax revenue.”

The analysis showcased that tax relief for MLBs is more cost effective than the Government’s recent initiative to boost employment. Verité estimated that the Government’s plan to recruit 160,000 workers will cost approximately Rs. 58.67 billion annually, while state-supported MLBs will boost the employment of women for less than one-tenth of this cost.

Society and the state have an obligation to ensure that women have equal opportunities in the labour market. While employers are made to bear the cost of MLBs solely, women will continue to be disadvantaged. Dr. De Mel stated that the state can boost female economic participation and combat this unfair disadvantage against women in the 20-40 age group by including MLBs in the forthcoming 2020/2021 Budget.

De Silva directed us to the Ministry Secretary, who was unavailable for comment at the time of printing. When we contacted the Commissioner General of Labour for the Department of Labour, R.P.A.

,,The economic horror of another lockdown,business,"By Madhusha Thavapalakumar

The seven-week-long lockdown from late March to early May, as a swift measure to control the local spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, rendered thousands of people unemployed, forced the share market to close its operations, paralysed exports, left small-scale business owners to worry about their next meal, and contracted the economic growth to negative rates in the second quarter of 2020.

After the reopening of the country, the economy was on a slow yet gradual recovery path in the last few months, slowly healing its scars from the previous lockdown, and the country was on track to achieve its revised economic targets. A number of economic indicators were almost fully recovered as they were nearing their pre-pandemic levels, while another set of indicators were recording an impressive recovery.

While a peaceful recovery was on its way, last Sunday (4), Sri Lanka reported a community case of Covid-19 after a gap of six months. Subsequent PCR tests done on the patient’s close contacts detected the Divulapitiya cluster, which, according to health authorities, is more dangerous than the Kandakadu cluster.

With the identification of a large cluster, fears over a possible second lockdown began to emerge amongst the business community of Sri Lanka, which could be dreadful at a time of recovery. This week, The Sunday Morning Business took a look at a number of areas of the Sri Lankan economy and what would be the impact of a second lockdown on them.

(At the time of going to print, curfew was imposed only in selected areas in the Gampaha District)

Terrible timing for exporters

Sri Lanka’s export industry is one of the top three foreign exchange earning sources of the country. According to the Export Development Board (EDB), Sri Lanka is one of the region’s most vibrant export hubs, as it is equally competent in the agriculture, manufacturing, and service sectors despite the dire need of a diversification in its export basket.

Exports took a massive hit following the lockdown in March. Manufacturing facilities could not continue their operations and mobility was strictly prohibited with the exemption of essential services.

Initially, there were also issues in procuring raw materials required for export purposes due to the Government’s early measures to impose stringent bans on all imports. However, later on, raw materials required for local sectors for export purposes were exempted from the ban.

Merchandise export earning figures for March reflected this sudden disruption with only $ 646 million being earned for the month. This was nearly a 42% drop from the $ 1,112 million recorded in March 2019.

As a result of the lockdown, merchandise export earnings recorded a historical Year-Over-Year (YoY) decrease by nearly 64% to $ 277.4 million in April 2020 from $ 772.57 million documented in April 2019, reflecting the impact of the closure of Sri Lanka’s export markets as well as domestic curfew restrictions.

The apparel sector recorded a sharp decline of 82% during the month of April, compared to the same month in the previous year. Other selected sectors that have recorded a significant decline during the same period included tea (-21%), coconut products (-35.2%), rubber products (-53%), food and beverages (-44%), spices (-24%), electronics and electronic components (-63%), petroleum products (-63%), seafood (-72%), and base metal products (-49%).

However, in May, exports managed to bounce back to $ 602 million compared to $ 277 million the previous month. It is also notable that the lockdown was lifted on 11 May and domestic operations began to return to normalcy soon after.

Earnings from exports rebounded further in the following month as $ 906.02 million exports were achieved in June, indicating a recovery of both domestic and global supply and demand chains to some extent. In July, Sri Lanka’s exports surpassed the $ 1 billion mark after six months.

The achievement was attributed by the EDB to Sri Lanka’s strategic location, its reliable manufacturing and export base, and proactive and rapid action taken by the Sri Lankan Government to control Covid-19. However, Sri Lanka’s exports during the month of August 2020 recorded a dip of 19.2% to $ 947.7 million, as compared to the value of $ 1,033.3 million recorded during the same month last year, according to the EDB. However, despite the slight dip in August, exports are largely on track to achieve the revised export target of $ 10.75 billion in 2020.

At a time when an impressive recovery is being made in one of the most important sectors of the economy, a second lockdown would be disastrous, National Chamber of Exporters (NCE) Immediate Past President Ramal Jasinghe said.

Speaking to The Sunday Morning Business, he stated that a second lockdown would be very serious as Sri Lanka’s exports are on a recovery path and have already entered into the new market post the first lockdown.

“Lockdown at this stage would be damaging for our country, as we are in the fourth quarter of the year. We have targets to achieve,” Jasinghe added.

He further noted that using the lessons learned from the initial lockdown, Sri Lanka should adopt better policies while taking necessary precautions to effectively control and cure the new cluster.

Retailers are not too worried

Even though Sri Lanka had a seven-week-long lockdown, all districts apart from three districts that were considered as high-risk areas eased curfew restrictions once or twice a week for the general public to purchase essential items. On this day, supermarkets, pharmacies, and other essential service providers opened their services to the general public.

In addition to this, a considerable number of people, particularly those who live in urban areas, managed to get essential items by shopping online. However, this moderate activity in the retail sector was limited only for pharmaceuticals and groceries, while other areas of retail such as electronics, furniture, and clothing remained somewhat sluggish.

However, the Sri Lanka Retailers’ Association (SLRA) believes that if we are to go for a second blanket lockdown, the lessons we learned from the first lockdown would make sure that other areas of the retail sector too would perform as usual during the lockdown.

SLRA Founder Chairman Hussain Sadique told The Sunday Morning Business that if the health authorities decide to go for a lockdown, it would be shorter and better than the previous one.

“Last time, the retail performance was mainly on groceries and pharmaceutical areas, but this time we are expecting performance across all sectors of the retail industry, if we are going into a lockdown, and certainly this lockdown would not be the same as the previous one,” Sadique added.

Speaking further, he noted that Sri Lanka is not in a financially stable position to afford another lockdown, but nevertheless, if we are in a situation to go for another lockdown, we should not hesitate to do that as safety should be the primary concern of the Government.

Noting that living with Covid-19 would be the new normal, he emphasised the importance of following pandemic guidelines to protect ourselves from the virus.

“The Government is prepared in terms of healthcare and safety measures as they were expecting another wave. So hopefully, this cluster too will be controlled,” Sadique added.

MSMEs hoping worse won’t come to worst

Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) make up a large part of the Sri Lankan economy, accounting for 80% of all businesses, according to the National Human Resources and Employment Policy. MSMEs are in all sectors of the economy and provide employment for skilled, semi-skilled, unskilled, and differently skilled people. MSMEs are an essential source of employment opportunities and are estimated to contribute about 35% of employment. In the service sector, SMEs accounts for more than 90% of business establishments. It is estimated that MSMEs contribute 52% to the GDP and are considered as the backbone of the economy.

According to a report done by the United Nations (UN), titled “Impact of Covid-19 to the MSME Sector in Sri Lanka”, with the local outbreak of the virus in March, most of the economic activities were badly affected, causing the MSMEs to undergo severe hardships. The daily wage earners were the most affected.

Although the agricultural sector was permitted to carry out their activities even during the lockdown, other sectors were mostly paralysed during the period. For example, in terms of the apparel sector, most of the SMEs in the sector depend on fabrics and accessories supplied from China and the disruption of the supply chain affected them severely.

The micro-level garment manufacturers also obtain their raw material from wholesale agents who import the items in bulk, mainly from China and India, and the breakdown of their supply chain added with the restrictions imposed by the curfew made them almost inactive.

In addition, the majority of the MSMEs faced working capital problems as they did not receive payments for goods supplied. The price escalation of raw materials due to limited availability also affected their operations.

Nevertheless, with a number of financial assistance initiatives from the Government, MSMEs began to show signs of recovery in the past couple of weeks, while a few of them managed to even reach the pre-pandemic levels. At a time like this, consequences of imposing another lockdown would be hard to even imagine, according to the Colombo Chamber of Commerce (CCC).

“Going for another lockdown is completely dependent on the decision of the health authorities, but this would be a bad time to go into a second lockdown as businesses are slowly recovering,” CCC President Saranga Wijeyarathne noted.

He added that businesses have been showing impressive signs of recovery in the past four to six weeks and in September, some of the businesses managed to achieve a turnover, better than that of before the initial lockdown.

According to him, against this backdrop, another lockdown would certainly act as an impediment to this recovery process and will possibly make the process sluggish, delaying it by months or even years.

In addition to this, another severe impact of a possible lockdown would be settling bank loans and payments. Wijeyarathne stated that most of the financial assistance given to the businesses by the Government are expired while the rest is reaching its expiration in the near future.

“This means that businesses have to start paying their loans. If businesses remain open, they can afford to pay these loans again somehow. But if there is a lockdown coming in, it would be hard for them to settle these loans,” he stated.

Speaking further, he stated that India too went for a blanket lockdown initially, deadlocking all of its economic activities, but after a certain point, the Indian Government decided to open its economy partially as it is impractical for a country to close economic activities completely.

“Opening the economy has its own positive and negative impacts. The pPositive impact is that the economy is somewhat performing. In terms of health, opening the economy could not be the best thing to do. But Sri Lanka is a much smaller country and more educated than them. So the authorities have to compulsorily make the general public adhere to health guidelines,” he added.

Wijeyarathne believes that if health guidelines are followed accordingly, there would not be a need to go for another lockdown as going for one would cost significantly to the economy.

Meanwhile, the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Sri Lanka (FCCISL) too expressed similar views, speaking to The Sunday Morning Business. FCCISL President Shirley Jayawardena stated that there would not be a need to go for another lockdown as the health authorities are capable of controlling the new Covid-19 cluster like they did with the Navy cluster.

“We hope that there will not be a stage to go for another lockdown. But if we are to go for one, we should not hesitate to do so. All we can do is to learn to live with it with adequate precautions,” she stated.

A knockout punch for tourism

It might not be wrong to say that tourism is the most affected sector from the ongoing pandemic. Sri Lanka, a tropical tourism destination that depends on tourism earnings for a large portion of its foreign exchange earnings, is yet to see international tourism on the island.

According to the aforementioned UN report, there are about 3,926 establishments catering to tourism and they directly employ a total of 169,903 people while indirectly employing about 219,484 people. The entire group is severely affected by the pandemic.

The income from the tourism industry recorded $ 3.59 billion in 2019 compared to $ 4.38 billion (4.9% to GDP) in 2018, a drop of $ 0.79 billion mainly due to the Easter Sunday attacks.

Nevertheless, Sri Lanka targeted to have a greater year ahead in terms of tourism and a further recovery in tourist arrivals. The country set a target of four million tourist arrivals for 2020. However, amidst crippled international tourism, particularly in the Asian region due to the coronavirus outbreak and its global spread, in early March this year, Sri Lanka revised this target to 2.3 million.

Nevertheless, days after this, Sri Lanka identified the first national case of Covid-19 on 10 March and this led to the closure of the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA), effectively bringing the tourism to zero levels a week later.

The BIA was initially scheduled to reopen on 1 August this year and this was moved to mid-August following a surge in local Covid-19 cases. The date was once again pushed back to September after identifying several Covid-19 clusters within the country. The Government is yet to announce a date on when the airport will be open to international travellers.

Nevertheless, following the lifting of the lockdown in May, hotels and tourist establishments were getting business from local travellers. Even though the number of local travellers does not match the international tourists, local tourism was some sort of a relief for the owners of these hotels to keep their businesses up and running with a glimmer of hope.

Against this backdrop, if Sri Lanka is going for another lockdown, it would bring local tourism too to zero, worsening the financial troubles of hotel owners, said The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) President Sanath Ukwatte.

“Already the industry is in a dangerous situation right now and it is hardly surviving. Even the local tourism accounts for about 20% of the overall tourism we were getting before the pandemic,” Ukwatte added.

He emphasised the need to create a balance between opening the country for tourism while effectively mitigating the Covid-19 situation within the country.

Lockdown or not, CSE could carry on

The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) crashed on Monday (5), a day after the discovery of the Minuwangoda Covid cluster, with the ASPI (All-Share Price Index) recording the biggest-ever drop of 5,587.18 points falling by 462.99 points on Monday, which led to the suspension of trading twice that day. However, it recovered significantly from Wednesday (7) onwards, with local bargain hunters coming to its rescue. Foreigners sold over Rs. 1 billion worth of shares on Wednesday and will almost certainly remain on the sell side until the local Covid situation settles down, and possibly even after. However, the CSE may remain in the green this week due to local investor participation.

The market was closed for trading in the last two weeks of March, after the S&amp;P SL20 Index, which includes the 20 largest companies by total market capitalisation listed on the CSE, dropped by 5% several times, triggering 30-minute halts in regular trading during the week that began on 16 March, a couple of days after the first case of Covid-19 in a Sri Lankan national.

The following week, it remained closed for four days with the Government declaring holidays. It was opened on 20 March, only to close shortly after opening. Since then, the CSE remained closed until 11 May, effectively not recording any flows into or out of the CSE.

Before opening for trading on 11 May, the CSE installed a new system under which the market would automatically close for the day if the S&amp;P SL20 Index dropped by 10% or more. The week from 11 May to 15 May saw a number of trading halts, and Rs. 1.5 billion in foreign inflow was reported during the week while Rs. 5 billion in outflow was reported in the same period. Overall, Rs. 3.5 billion in net foreign outflow was reported during this particular week.

Meanwhile, at the end of the second week after reopening, foreigners bought stocks worth Rs. 1.6 billion, an improvement compared to the first week, while they sold stocks worth Rs. 1.5 billion compared to Rs. 5 billion the previous week.

During the third week after the reopening of the CSE, foreign purchases witnessed a drop compared to the week prior, as it was reported at Rs. 593.1 million, while shares sold by foreigners hiked to Rs. 3.9 billion that same week.

In June, net foreign outflows were Rs. 8.6 billion and this reduced to Rs. 3.3 billion the following month. However, the following month, which is August, the net foreign outflows shot up to Rs. 8.06 billion.

Nevertheless, in September, showing an impressive recovery after the initial lockdown, the CSE was identified as the best performing exchange in the world in the month of September.

Issuing a statement on the achievement, CSE Chairman Dumith Fernando stated that the continued low interest rate environment has led to more financial assets being moved from low-yielding fixed income assets into the share market, and we expect that to continue into the coming months.

However, Fernando told The Sunday Morning Business that if Sri Lanka is to go for another lockdown, the CSE is prepared to operate even during the lockdown, unlike the previous time.

“At that time, the market was not ready to operate without people in their offices. This time, the CSE and stock broker firms are prepared to operate even during a curfew,” he added.

Subsequently, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) too confirmed to us that there would not be a market closure even if there was a lockdown or curfew in Colombo.

Conclusion

Based on the comments we have received for this article, it is apparent that a second lockdown at a time when the economy is showing signs of recovery would damage the recovery process as a large part of the economy may not operate during the lockdown. As the above officials noted, it is imperative to adhere to health guidelines while also keeping the economy up and running, given the fact that our country clearly cannot afford another long national lockdown.",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,The economic horror of another lockdown,business,0,1602390666,0,100668,,

,,Sri Lanka’s fish not on Aussie shores,business,"By Uwin Lugoda

Sri Lanka’s island status has made it a rich hub for seafood of different varieties and an extensive network of seafood exporters. Thus, the seafood product sector has emerged as a quality exporter of a wide variety of fish, with the most popular of them being tuna.

According to the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) website, the country is currently home to 24 seafood exporters, whose top five exports consist of tuna (in fresh, chilled, and frozen forms), shrimps and prawns, crabs and lobsters, shark fins, and fish maws. These exporters have penetrated several international markets including the likes of the US, Italy, France, the Netherlands and Hong Kong.

Sri Lanka also hosts 32 EU-approved seafood processing plants which successfully comply with the stringent regulations imposed by importing countries and adhere to the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP), Friend of Sea, and other food security environment-friendly requirements.

Due to this, the country’s seafood exports have been able to garner substantial revenue over the years, with EDB reports showing that the export performance of the sector was $ 265 million in 2018 and $ 262 million in 2019.

EDB Chairman Prabhash Subasinghe reported that Sri Lanka’s seafood exports are seeing strong demand and higher prices even during the global pandemic in April 2020 during an online forum organised by Advocata Institute, a Colombo-based think tank.

During this forum, he explained that the country was exporting to top markets like Italy, even though those markets were under lockdown. He attributed this to the Government declaring seafood as an essential service soon after the initial nationwide curfew was imposed.

Despite this, Sri Lankan seafood exporters seem to be dropping the ball when it comes to other markets like Australia, according to Seafood Importers’ Association of Australasia (SIAA) Executive Officer Mark Boulter. During a webinar on “Market Enhancement for Sri Lankan Products and Services in Australia”, held on 7 October, he stated that Sri Lanka has a huge potential to tap the Australian seafood importers market.

Australia is a big market for Sri Lankan seafood exporters, even being among the top 10 in 2011, according to the EDB website. However, Sri Lanka is not among Australia’s top 10 importers. In his presentation, Boulter showed that in 2019, Australia imported 214,000 tonnes of seafood, with 150,000 tonnes of it being from Thailand, China, Vietnam, and New Zealand, the country’s top four importer markets, respectively.

“Imported seafood is the largest sector of our seafood industry and it represents up to 65% of Australian seafood consumption. Our seafood imports come up to about $ 1.9 to 2 billion per annum, and as of now, these four nations gain a bulk of it, tying up the Australian seafood trade.”

Compared to this, his presentation revealed that according to Australian trade data, Sri Lanka only accounted for 81 tonnes.

With a population of 25 million people where around 15 kg of seafood is consumed per person each year, Australia generates about $ 5 billion in revenue from end-of-point sales of imported seafood. The main imported categories of seafood include canned and frozen, out of which the top three are 82,686 tonnes of canned fish like tuna, 52,822 tonnes of whitefish, and 31,734 tonnes of prawns.

Boulter pointed out that since tuna is Sri Lanka’s top seafood export, and one of Australia’s top seafood imports, there is a massive opportunity for local exporters to tap into the Australian market, particularly in the frozen seafood category.

“If I had to pick some species which I think would provide Sri Lankan exporters a great opportunity, I would say any whitefish species like barramundi, and blue swimmer crabs.”

He explained that there were several hurdles local exporters should familiarise themselves with before commencing business with Australia. These included government regulatory requirements such as biosecurity which set the grounds for what can and cannot be brought to Australia and under what format they should be brought in, food safety assessments to inspect the products against food standard codes, weights and measures, and labelling/naming of the products.

Boulter stated that other requirements include market requirements with regards to specifications and sustainability/social welfare.

During the webinar, Consulate General of Sri Lanka in Sydney, Australia Consul (Commercial) M.M. Abdul Raheem agreed with Boulter’s statement on the potential of Sri Lankan seafood exports. He gave a comprehensive overview on how easy trading with Australia really is.

In his presentation, Raheem showed that Australia is an open market with minimal restrictions on imports of goods and services. This is due to their trade policy being based on trade openness, economic growth, and improved living standards, with emphasis on improving international competitiveness and market access overseas.

The country also places a high level of dependence on imports of a number of products, which include seafood.

Moreover, Raheem stated that customs tariff rates in Australia vary from 0 to 5%, with an average duty rate of 4.6%. However, some goods such as food items and electronic products do not attract customs duty.

“These reasons add to the huge potential of the local seafood exporters to tap into the vast Australian market which is currently being dominated by other countries in the region like Thailand and Vietnam,” Raheem noted.",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Sri Lanka’s fish not on Aussie shores,business,0,1602390690,0,100670,,

,,John Keells unveils residential golf properties near Victoria,business,"By Uwin Lugoda

Sri Lankan real estate giant John Keells Properties expanded their already diverse portfolio recently (3 October), with the announcement of two new sets of luxury properties based in and around the Victoria Golf and Country Resort in Digana.

Spanning an area of around 517 acres, the main property is set to accommodate the luxury resort, the real estate property, and an 18-hole golf course. Named “Sunrise Ridge” and “Peacock Valley”, the two properties are set to be some of the most unique real estate properties available in Sri Lanka, according to John Keells Holdings PLC Assistant Vice President and Head of Sales – Property Group Nadeem Shums.

Speaking to The Sunday Morning Business, he stated that the two residential properties will be located in separate parts of the main property, with Peacock Valley being at the heart of the golf course and Sunrise Ridge being dotted alongside the course.

Peacock Valley is designed to be a set of premium land plots surrounded by the golf course, each ranging between 47 and 139 perches. Shums stated that these lands are going to be the most exclusive plots in the entire property.

As for Sunrise Ridge, he stated that these are luxury townhouses, approximately 2,000 sq. ft. in size, consisting of two bedrooms complete with a kitchenette, living room, and private deck. The property consists of 16 townhouses, with each being around 10 perches.

Sunrise Ridge also guarantees buyers a hassle-free experience, providing their townhouses to be professionally managed by the Victoria Golf and Country Resort. Shums explained that this property also acts as a good investment for buyers, as the company will use the townhouses as a part of the resort and the owners will get a share of that revenue, and also get up to 90 days of free stay at the property each year.

“The real advantage of owning this property is that you have a hassle-free investment, because you do not have to deal with its construction or maintenance; it is all done by us.”

These property owners will also automatically have access to the Victoria Golf Course, which is currently being managed by one of the world’s biggest golf operators, Troon International. The 18-hole golf course is designed in accordance with international United States Golf Association (USGA) standards.

The resort first partnered with Troon in 2019 to ensure consistent quality to all their guests. The industry-leading golf management company operates at over 450 locations around the world, which include the likes of The Grove in London and the Abu Dhabi Golf Club.

According to Shums, the 120-acre golf course is ideal for both amateurs and professional golfers, with an academy dedicated to train golf enthusiasts. It is a 73-par, 6,933-yard championship course with undulating grounds for a more challenging game, and has been laid with Zorro Zoysia grass brought down from Georgia, USA with a state-of-the-art irrigation system.

The course has also been the recipient of several awards in the last two years, once being ranked by Golf Digest as one of the “100 Most Beautiful Golf Courses in the World” and the “Most Memorable Golf Course in Asia 2019” by Destination Golf. The latter is one of the leading golf travel publishing companies, which is recognised and respected globally by the golfing community. Moreover, Destination Golf is an approved member of the International Association of Golf Tour Operators (IAGTO).

Shums stated that the owners of the two properties will also get the added benefit of being a part of the Troon family, garnering them special benefits from other Troon-operated golf courses. Other activities in the Victoria Golf and Country Resort comprise cultural tours and sports, including facilities for swimming, tennis, paintball, archery, horse riding, hiking, cycling, and table tennis.",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,John Keells unveils residential golf properties near Victoria,business,0,1602425570,0,100699,,

 “First of all, we would like to thank all the parents who have placed their trust in the Government to send their children to the examination. Parents called us and thanked the Government. We are happy about that,” Prof. Peiris elaborated. 

 He further noted that a majority of parents had sent requests to the Ministry of Education to not further delay the Grade Five Scholarship and A/L examinations of 2020. 

 “The examinations were already postponed twice, and we did not want to burden the children and the parents anymore. Therefore, as agreed upon over the past weeks, we have now prepared all examination centres and halls to adhere to the health and safety guidelines that were issued by the health services authorities, the Ministry of Defence, and the Ministry of Transport to facilitate the examinations that will be held in the next four weeks,” Prof. Peiris added.

,,Uni entrance delayed: Cut off marks yet to be released,news,"By Maheesha Mudugamuwa 

 The students who sat for the GCE Advanced Level (A/L) examination in 2019 have been in a difficult situation as the cut off marks for admission to state universities in Sri Lanka have not yet been announced, according to the Socialist Students’ Union (SSU). 

 SSU National Organiser Rangana Devapriya told    The Morning    that although more than 13 months have passed since last year’s A/L examination, students today are suffering without a confirmation as to whether they have qualified for university entrance or not. 

 He further said that students who pass the A/L examination every year are facing this problem due to the failure of the educational authorities in the country, including the ministers of education, to prepare a formal programme. 

 “This time, it has become more complicated. This is due to the fact that when the A/L results for the year 2019 were released, all the streams were lined up under two categories as old and new syllabus students,” he added. 

 Although the manner in which the results were released was correct, students today have lost the ability to roughly predict how many students will be enrolled from each district from each category (old and new), Devapriya stressed. 

 “Call for applications for the Advanced Diploma in Technology (NDT) and the National Diploma in Technology (NDT) have already started, and even if you know you are eligible for university admission after registering for these courses, you cannot cancel the registration and enter the university,” he added.

,,Security Detail | More security sought for Opposition Leader,news," By Sarah Hannan 

 
           Defence Ministry yet to act on request  
           Request should first be sent to MSD  
 
 The request to improve the security detail afforded to Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa is yet to be attended to,    The Morning    learnt. 

 On 30 September, Private Secretary to the Opposition Leader Attorney-at-Law Ravi Jayawardana had submitted a letter of request addressed to Ministry of Defence Secretary Maj. Gen. (Retd.) Kamal Gunaratne, seeking to increase the current security detail. 

 The request was made following an incident that occurred at the Mount Lavinia Police Division on 29 September where Premadasa, who is the Leader of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), and his team faced a stone pelting episode when they visited the area to address their party supporters and announced their stand on the proposed draft 20th Amendment to the Constitution. 

 Jayawardana had further noted that given the Opposition Leader’s position and increasing frequency of public engagements, he will require a larger security detail than he is afforded. 

 When    The Morning    contacted the Ministry of Defence to inquire the action they are taking over the request, we were informed that the request should go through the police Ministerial Security Division (MSD) Unit which would then send it for the approval of the Ministry of Defence, after assessing the situation and deciding on the actual requirement to increase the security detail for the Opposition Leader.

 The Inter University Students’ Federation (IUSF) alleged that the administration of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura (USJ) has not yet informed its students about the recent discovery of a Covid-19-positive student reported from the university. 

 IUSF Convener Ven. Rathkarawwa Jinarathana Thera told the media that they got to know about the Covid-19-positive student only after the media reported it. 

 “The university administration has confirmed that a sister of the Jayewardenepura University has contracted Covid-19, but no official statement has been made yesterday,” the Thera said. 

 Speaking further, Ven. Jinaratana Thera said that the student is a third-year student in the Department of Management Studies and that she had also attended a lecture at the university on 4 October. The said student had been staying with several other students in a boarding house near the university, he said. 

 According to the Thera, there is a serious risk of the virus spreading further due to these facts, and withholding information will further increase that risk.

,,Miss Sri Lanka 2020: Vote for ‘Miss Popular’,brunch,"By Dimithri Wijesinghe 

 The grand finale of Miss Sri Lanka 2020, scheduled to be held in October this year, was postponed until further notice due to the prevailing concerns of a spike in Covid-19 cases in the island. 

 In light of this, Sky View Productions (Pvt.) Ltd. National Director Tharindu Lakshan shared: “We regret to inform you that as per the notice issued by the Ministry of Health of Sri Lanka, to ensure public safety, Miss Sri Lanka 2020 Grand Finale will be postponed until further notice. We thereby notify that the tickets that have already been purchased will be valid and the new date will be updated soon.” 

 However, the competition, which has been in progress since February of 2020, is currently in its final stages. The event’s preliminary audition rounds were initially held at Cinnamon Grand Colombo  in earlier this year and the 12 finalists went on to participate in the mini pageants. 

 The mini pageants took place on 29 at Grand Mondo Hotel and showcased the variety rounds where contestants showcased their skills, and at the event, the contestants took part in the talent rounds, having completed the other segments of this round which included the cat walk round, beachwear, and a number of other segments. 

Tharindu shared that while the event has been postponed, unfortunately, there is one last category that is still ongoing – the title of “Miss Popular”, which is a title based on audience votes. He said that voting has been opened for this title and all contestants’ photographs have been shared on the official Facebook page. Audiences are therefore encouraged to vote for their favourite contestant. 

Voting entails hitting an up-vote – a “like” – on your preferred contestant’s individual post, Tharindu said. Voting will be closed on 31   October and so there is only a period of three weeks left to cast your vote for your favourite contestant. 

The ladies contesting are Nuwanthika Nanayakkara from Kadawatha, Hashela Harischandra from Kelaniya, Oshini Shanaya from Ja-Ela, Suwini Aloka from Negombo, Pragya Gamage from Thalawathugoda, Amizhthini Nakkeeran from Colombo, Kamilini Kammi from Dehiwala, Shenya Wijerathne from Colombo, Ravini Perera from Kurunegala, Chathini Wickramasooriye from  Kurunegala, Aarya Samarawickrama from Rajagiriya, Waruni Nisansala from Kalawana, and Shenya Wijerathne from Piliyandala. 

The Miss Sri Lanka 2020 competition, which is under the direction of Tharindu Lakshan, will be hosted by Tharindu. He shared that the primary reason why they chose to launch this initiative was in answer to some of the scrutiny the beauty pageant industry has been under in the past few years in Sri Lanka, stating that their goal is to somewhat reinvent the bad name the industry has got and give it a fresh start. 

 Keeping with their mission statement, the events they’ve held so far have been reflective of their efforts, with the most recent event, the talent round held in August, coming to fruition with great success, and the finalists who are representative of nearly all parts of the island bringing to the Miss Sri Lanka stage a colorful array of talents. 

 Miss Sri Lanka 2020 is the second instalment of the Miss Sri Lankan title organised by Sky View Productions, where 2019’s winner went on to take part in the international pageant “Miss Tourism” held in China. The 2020 titleholder will be awarded the opportunity of a lifetime to qualify for Miss Asia Global to be held in Malaysia.

,,What happens to the events industry now?,brunch," By Naveed Rozais 

2020 has seen large-scale events become something of a work of wonder. With the lockdown in March completely and utterly halting events of any kind for three months, the events industry took a severe blow at a time when they were just recovering from other setbacks. 

The recent surge of Covid-19 infections has led to the Government prohibiting the organisation, promotion, and conducting of any events including but not limited to exhibitions, musical shows, outdoor events, parties, and conferences until further notice. 

The Morning Brunch    reached out to Event Productions (Pvt.) Ltd. Founder/Managing Director and Event Management Association (EMA) President Roshan Wijeyaratne to gain some insights into how the events industry is handling and responding to this latest setback. 

 Overall state of industry 

Wijeyaratne explained that the last one-and-a-half years or so have been a very turbulent time for the industry. 

 “This is our fourth big blow – the first was the political turmoil in October 2018, followed by the Easter attacks, and then Covid-19,” Wijeyaratne shared, adding that following the Easter attacks in April last year, some event companies ran for up to five months with no income at all, draining their resources to keep their companies going and their staff paid. 

 The timing of the pandemic and the lockdown has been particularly hard for the events industry. “We had already taken heavy losses and were not geared to face another blow,” Wijeyaratne stressed. 

 With Covid-19 in particular, Colombo and the rest of Sri Lanka were just getting used to large events taking place again, albeit in scaled down versions. 

 This came to a crashing halt when the newest cluster of Covid-19 infections was discovered on 4 October, with over 1,000 infections and climbing being reported since. This, combined with the Government’s directive to suspend events in the interim while the threat is dealt with, has led to many event cancellations. 

 Speaking on cancellations, Wijeyaratne explained that in many cases, event companies don’t take advances from clients, especially clients with whom they have longstanding relationships. 

 “What happens when an event gets cancelled is that, basically for us, as event managers,  we lose out a lot because we do all the groundwork. A lot of time goes into planning and there’s typically no cancellation fee. Hotels and vendors generally take an advance based on the relationship, and if it's a postponement, they carry the advance forward, but it all depends on the venue, the vendor, and the relationship,” he said. 

 Responding as an industry 

 “We launched the EMA in 2019 after Easter, and we now have over 60 members. Immediately after Covid happened, we started engaging with the Government and met with the Prime Minister that month itself. The Prime Minister directed (us) to the Treasury Secretary. The EMA also consulted with the Government and the Ministry of Health to put together a set of guidelines as to how an event could be conducted mid-pandemic,” Wijeyaratne elaborated. 

 On a private level, the EMA has been working with Ernst &amp; Young to do a study to protect the marketing and communications (marcom) industries which encompasses marketing, communications, video production, and event management among a host of other skills and services. 

 “The marcom industry is a Rs. 151 billion industry. It is 1% of our country’s GDP. We did a presentation to the Prime Minister and Finance Minister a couple of weeks ago, with the view of the Government considering the marcom industry in their budget and coming up with proposals like giving our clients concessions on marcom spending so that clients are encouraged to hold events as opposed to cutting back due to taxes,” he said. 

 The EMA is also approaching the Government to revise entertainment taxation, proposing that entertainment taxes be waived for a year in order to allow the events industry to bounce back. 

 Taking events online 

 The pandemic has made online living and interaction the order of the day. While going online is something that is important, Wijeyaratne explained that going online is not something the events industry can sustain, particularly at the ground level. 

 “You can do events, but so many people, especially those at the labour level, get nothing out of an online event. It can't help the industry as a whole. Sound equipment, lighting, LED screen vendors lose out. What you earn off an online event is very small. It's not enough to sustain your company in the long term,” he pointed out.

,,SL-China to review export basket to fix lopsided trade balance,business,"President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa with the high-level Chinese delegation

 Sri Lanka and China have agreed that the export basket of Sri Lanka offered to China needs to be reviewed in order to boost exports to China and improve the trade balance, which has long been in favour of China. 

 This was agreed in principle when President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa met a high-level Chinese delegation on 9 October in Colombo, in the presence of Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, Ministry Secretary Admiral Prof. Jayanath Colombage, and other government ministers and dignitaries. 

 The Chinese delegation consisted of a key Communist Party political bureau member and diplomat Yang Jiechi, along with China International Development Co-operation Agency Chairman Wang Xiaotao and Chinese Foreign Ministry official Cheng Song. 

 The Sri Lankan Government requested the Chinese delegates to facilitate market access to some of Sri Lanka’s unique commodities that could find demand in the Chinese domestic market towards increasing the trade turnover. 

 In 2017, China was the sixth largest export destination for Sri Lanka. The total export value from Sri Lanka to China was just $ 414.7 million in 2017 and total imports from China to Sri Lanka for the same period was a much higher $ 4,189.8 million. However, Sri Lanka’s exports had increased by that time from $ 121.4 million in 2013. 

 Both parties also agreed on the need to resume negotiations on the stalled talks on the Sri Lanka-China Free Trade Agreement (FTA). 

 China is the world’s second largest economy and an FTA with it has been coveted by Sri Lanka for many years. Negotiations on this FTA finally commenced in 2016, but had come to a virtual standstill by 2018.   This was due to Sri Lanka’s insistence on reviewing the agreement every 10 years, to which China was strongly opposed due to its willingness to have longer-term stability, according to Sri Lanka’s then Chief Trade Negotiator K.J. Weerasinghe, as reported by    Reuters    in May 2018. 

 The massive difference in bargaining power between the two nations also meant that China insisted on a zero-tariff regime which would have overwhelmingly benefited them due to the bilateral trade relationship being dominated by China’s exports to Sri Lanka. 

 Sri Lanka’s pushback on these proposals is also believed to have contributed to the breakdown of talks in 2017. ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,SL-China to review export basket to fix lopsided trade balance,business,0,1602453659,0,100743,,

,,China awards Sri Lanka with Rs 16.5 bn grant,news,"China announced on Sunday (11) that it was providing a RMB Yuan 600 million (LKR 16.5 billion/USD 90 million) grant to Sri Lanka in an Agreement on Economic and Technical Cooperation.

Calling the financial assistance a “timely grant,” the Chinese Embassy in Colombo said that it would be used for medical care, education and water supplies in Sri Lanka’s rural areas and that it would “contribute to the well-being of (Sri Lankans) in a post-COVID era.”

The agreement was signed on Friday, by Wang Xiaotao, Chairman of China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA) and S. R. Attygalle, Treasury Secretary of the Sri Lankan Ministry of Finance.

The announcement follows a visit to the Indian Ocean island nation Friday by a Chinese delegation led by Yang Jiechi, a Communist Party Politburo member and a former foreign minister.

During talks with Yang, Sri Lankan President Gotabhaya Rajapaksa asked China to help him in disproving a perception that China-funded megaprojects are “debt traps” aimed at gaining influence in local affairs.

The statement issued by the Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka:

“On 9th November, an Agreement of Economic and Technical Cooperation between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, providing 600 million RMB yuan (LKR 16.5 billion) in grant assistance, was signed by H.E. Wang Xiaotao, Chairman of China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA) and Mr. S. R. Attygalle, Treasury Secretary of the Ministry of Finance of Sri Lanka, on the sidelines of H. E. Yang Jiechi’s visit to the island nation. Both President H. E. Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa extended their sincere appreciation on behalf of the Sri Lankan Government and people to the Chinese side for this urgently-needed assistance.

Mutually agreed by both sides, the timely grant from the Chinese Government and her people will be utilized with a high priority on medical care, education and water supply etc in rural areas of Sri Lanka, so as to contribute to the well-beings of her people in a post-COVID era.

Besides, during the meeting between H. E. Yang Jiechi, member of Political Bureau of CPC and Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, they also went through other Chinese grant projects such as the National Nephrology (Kidney Disease) Hospital in Polonnaruwa and the new Out-Patient Department (OPD) of National Hospital in Colombo and expressed their satisfaction on the good progress despite the COVID-19 pandemic.”",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,China awards Sri Lanka with Rs 16.5 bn grant,news,0,1602476658,0,100774,,

,,Study reveals COVID-19 active on smooth surfaces for 28 days,news,"A new study reveals that the COVID- 19 virus can be active for up to 28 days in a laboratory setting, Australian researchers said today (12).

Researchers at Australia’s national science agency, CSIRO, found that at 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit) the SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) virus remained infectious for 28 days on smooth surfaces. The study was published in Virology Journal. The researchers also point out that the virus can persist for long periods of time on banknotes, cell phone screens and stainless steel.

CSIRO’s research involved drying virus in an artificial mucus on a range of surfaces at concentrations similar to samples from COVID-19 patients and then extracting the virus after a month.

Experiments done in controlled laboratory environments at 20, 30 and 40 degrees C showed that the survival time declined as the temperature increased.

“Establishing how long the virus really remains viable on surfaces enables us to more accurately predict and mitigate its spread and do a better job of protecting our people,” CSIRO Chief Executive Larry Marshall said in a statement.

However, the test was conducted in a dark environment and it was previously confirmed that ultraviolet rays can destroy the virus.

COVID-19 spreads most often when an infected person itches, sneezes, or speaks.

,,"BISHOPS: The good, the bad and the ugly",news,"Bishops are at their most effective in open positions, when pawns – especially central ones – have disappeared from the board. Such positions allow them the power to exert control over as many spaces as possible by operating in open diagonals. In closed positions, however, it is not so straightforward to evaluate the prospects of a bishop. In such positions, bishops are generally classified as “good” or “bad” based on their relationship with its own pawns, particularly the central ones. (Pic 1)  French structure  The traditional concept about good and bad bishops is easy to comprehend in closed pawn structures like the one above. The black bishop on c8 is “bad” because its own pawns on e6 and d5 impede its freedom of movement. Conversely white’s “good” bishop on f1 will eventually be developed to d3, rendered active by the placement of white’s central pawns on dark squares. The Capablanca Rule states that: “When you have one bishop left on the board, place your pawns on the opposite colour squares to your bishop.” However, in practical game situations, it is more a question of first observing the colour complexes of your pawn chain and then trying to determine which bishop you would rather exchange or keep. Let’s look at some of the examples to grasp this concept better. (Pic 2)  Karpov – Seirawan (1982)  In the above position arising from the French Defence, black played 8. … Ba6, forcing the exchange of his “bad” bishop with white’s “good” one. As a result, a fantastic outpost on c4 was held in reserve for the occupation of a black knight later in the game. Proper understanding of the Capablanca Rule will help a chess player obtain favourable positions where a knight in an outpost would dominate the opponent’s remaining “ugly” bishop. The following position is highly instructive in this regard. (Pic 3)  Smyslov – Rudakovsky (1945)  Black’s bishop on e6 is threatened and it is almost hard to believe that a natural move like 13. … Bc4 is a positional error. On closer inspection, it becomes evident that black is actually offering to exchange his good bishop! 13. …Bc4 14.Bxc4 Qxc4 15.Bg5! When exchanging pieces what matters, are the pieces that remain on the board, and not the ones that are traded. White plans to give up his good bishop for a black knight on f6, thus creating a position where white can dominate using his lone knight against black’s “ugly” bishop. The rest is simply a matter of technique. 15. … Rfe8 16.Bxf6 Bxf6 17.Nd5 Bd8 (Pic 4)  Domination of white knight over black’s ‘ugly’ bishop   18.c3 b5 19.b3 Qc5+ 20.Kh1 Rc8 21.Rf3 Kh8 22.f6 gxf6 23.Qh4 Rg8 24.Nxf6 Rg7 25.Rg3 Bxf6 26.Qxf6 Rcg8 27.Rd1 d5 28.Rxg7 1–0 A more modern interpretation would be to differentiate bishops, as active or inactive rather than good or bad. A “bad” bishop operating outside his pawn chain can be very effective (imagine a black bishop on f5 instead of c8 in the French structure) while a “good” bishop looking at a wall of opposition pawns is deemed ineffective. While the Capablanca Rule stays true on most positions, there are exceptions, most notably positions with opposite coloured bishops. In chess, no positional concept applies in isolation, so it is important to think objectively and not take these “good” and “bad” classifications too literally.

 The main issue in the operational process of controlling the spread of the virus is tracing the close contacts of the Covid-19-infected patients as some do not divulge accurate information on their whereabouts, Police Media Spokesperson Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Ajith Rohana said yesterday (12).  

 Speaking at a programme held by Ada Derana, DIG Rohana said that one reason behind the resistance of people to divulge information is the stigma associated with the virus, and the possible discrimination from society makes people reluctant to divulge information or be subjected to testing.  

 “Contracting Covid-19 does not mean that the infected person had engaged in bad practices. Sri Lankans have not yet understood the gravity of the Covid-19 pandemic,” he added.  

 “If a social media post divulges the identity of a Covid-19 patient with their face and whereabouts, it is considered damaging to the quarantine procedure. People become reluctant to give samples for PCR tests. Therefore, if a person obstructs a quarantine procedure, it is an offence,” DIG Rohana said, adding that the State Intelligence Service (SIS) is the main agency that assists health authorities to trace and track down Covid-19 cases and prevent the spread of the virus.

 By Sarah Hannan  

 To solve the lack of parking spaces in the metropolises, the Urban Development Authority (UDA) recently broke ground at the site behind Lake House, Colombo Fort.  

 “Eight multi-storey car parks are planned to be constructed by the UDA, which will ease the traffic congestion and solve the parking problem in the city. The first phase of the project has commenced now and will cost Rs. 1,113 million,” Secretary to the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing Sirinimal Perera said.  

 The cost of the project is to be borne by the UDA, and the multi-storey car park that is to be constructed will be the first of its kind undertaken by government agencies. The car park at D.R. Wijewardena Mawatha will comprise 10 storeys sprawling across 18,444 sq. ft. to accommodate up to 252 vehicles.  

 The ground floor of the car park will have a 2,015 sq. ft. shopping complex, with the first and second floors of 2,540 sq. ft. allotted to the Colombo Fort Police Station. Vehicles will be able to park from the third to the ninth floor and seven residential units will be constructed on the topmost floor.  

 The estimated time of completion has been projected to be four years, with 12 car parks to be constructed islandwide; eight of them are to be built in the city of Colombo and the remaining four outside Colombo.

,,Govt. spent Rs. 1.6 trillion in 13 years for roads and highways,news,"Highest allocation of Rs. 256.5 b in 2019  
RDA to study construction performance   
 
By Maheesha Mudugamuwa 

 In the 13 years from 2007 to 2020, governments spent around Rs.1.6 trillion on the highways sector,    The Morning    learnt.  

 This has been revealed in the latest performance report of the Ministry of Highways.  

 The report further revealed that the highest amount of money was spent in 2017.  

 As learnt by    The Morning   , the money was spent on highways, national highways and flyovers, and bridges on national highways, according to the Ministry of Roads and Highways' 2019 Performance Report recently presented to Parliament.  

 The highest allocation to the Ministry during these 13 years was Rs. 256.5 billion last year (2019).  

 The report also revealed that the office of the Minister of Roads and Highways received Rs. 60 million last year (2019), compared to the Rs. 27.8 million allocated in 2018.  

 When contacted by    The Morning   , Road Development Authority (RDA) Chairman Chaminda Athaluwage said he would have to look into the report to see whether the construction performance was at an acceptable level.

,,Govt. urged to hold independent inquiry ,news," By Maheesha Mudugamuwa 

The Free Trade Zones and General Services Employees’ Union (FTZ &amp; GSEU) has urged the Government to hold an independent inquiry into the present outbreak of Covid-19 at the Brandix factory in Minuwangoda.  

 In a letter dated 11 October 2020 written to Presidential Task Force on Covid-19 Chairman Lt. Gen. Shavendra Silva, FTZ &amp; GSEU Joint Secretary Anton Marcus requested the appointment of a special investigation committee with expertise and knowledge on the apparel and export manufacture sector and also community health, to investigate the outbreak and spread of the Covid-19 virus at the Brandix factory in Minuwangoda and whether it had any Indian connection; by way of Sri Lankan expatriates through Indian labour or through raw materials imported from India.  

 Numerous media reports on the suspicion of how the Brandix factory in Minuwangoda became the origin of the present wave of Covid-19 are also linked to Sri Lankan expatriates or Indian labour brought from Visakhapatnam during the last weeks of September. To this effect, the Brandix management has cautiously avoided making a statement regarding the suspicion, the letter alleged.  

 It further alleged that some big companies that manufacture exports and handle mega construction projects have been employing cheap labour from neighbouring countries, especially during the last decade. Despite the pandemic, labour from these neighbouring countries continued, although not to the prior extent.  

 Citing several media reports, the Union Secretary has stressed that the suspicion that there can be an Indian link to the Covid-19 outbreak at the Brandix factory in Minuwangoda keeps growing with no acceptable, forthright, and official explanation to date from the Brandix management.  

 “We feel disturbed with these allegations going without any reasonable and acceptable explanation from relevant quarters. It could impact adversely on the whole apparel industry and in turn its employees too,” he has stressed.  

 Therefore, the union reiterated that the Government should appoint an independent commission to investigate the outbreak and spread of the Covid-19 virus at the Brandix factory.  

 Meanwhile, Labour Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva has appointed a committee to investigate complaints against the Minuwangoda Brandix factory for not following proper health guidelines to prevent the spread of Covid-19.  

 The committee was appointed last evening (12) at a meeting held at the Labour Ministry. The committee comprises Deputy Commissioner of Labour E.C.P. Dabare and Department of Labour Legal Officer K.B.G. Premadasa.  

 The Minister has instructed the factory management to obtain full statements from the factory administration on whether the factory’s health committees implemented during the Covid period were properly functioning in the factory premises and whether the Covid prevention health instructions were followed, and so on. The Minister also requested the trade union representatives to submit their complaints, evidence, and statements to the committee appointed last evening.

,,Search for greener pastures continue,focus," Bullet Points  ·         Reunion Island latest destination for illegal migrants   By Maheesha Mudugamuwa and Judy Fernando   Thousands of people have fallen victim to human smuggling around the world over the past few years, and the number of reported cases in Sri Lanka is on the rise. Approximately, seven such incidents have been reported by Sri Lanka Navy (SLN) from May to September this year, SLN statistics revealed.  According to them, the latest smuggling tragedy occurred last month, where the SLN apprehended 90 illegal Sri Lankan immigrants on board, who were heading to the Reunion Island in French territory. Among the suspects were 89 men and a woman; residents of Batticoloa, Thoduwawa, Udappuwa, Chilaw, Mannar, Ampara and Matale. During their preliminary investigations, the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) has discovered that a group of people from Eastern Province have been taken to Chilaw and Negombo by human smugglers, and were kept captive as mentioned above. However, a precise location as to where the group was kept captive had not yet been revealed.  Changing course  On 10 September, the CID found that a group of 90 individuals were being migrated to Reunion Island from the Marawila coastline in a multi-day boat registered under No. IMUL-A-0621-CHW, named  Anuka Putha . Subsequently, the group of illegal migrants was brought to the Colombo Harbour Police station to begin further investigations. As revealed, amidst the migrants were 21 Sinhalese, 67 Tamils, and two Muslims from areas including Batticaloa, Chilaw, Ampara, Mannar and Trincomalee. The illegal migration operation took place after acquiring money from individuals who were present on the trawler, among which four were identified; Lakshman, whose precise residence is yet to be identified, Dankotuwa resident Antony, Chilaw resident Namal (also known as Tharanga), and Valaichchenai resident Muhundan. The records also revealed that the culprit of this illegal migration to Reunion Island is identified as Balapuwaduge Prasad Indika Dilan Mendis – an illegal migrant who fled from Sri Lanka previously, and presently residing in the same island. The CID Marine Division then conducted investigations on the alleged. However, the 2018 trafficking in Persons Report says that Sri Lanka did not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; yet, it is making significant efforts to do so. As reported over the last five years, Sri Lanka is primarily a source, destination, and to a lesser extent, a transit country for men, women, and children subject to forced labour and sex trafficking. Some of the Sri Lankan men, women, and children who migrate to the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Afghanistan to work in the construction, garment, and domestic service sectors are subject to aforementioned forced labour.   Creating awareness  The International Labour Organisation (ILO) National Project Coordinator for Trafficking Thilini Fernando told  The Sunday Morning  that the ILO’s project has concluded a scoping study to identify the presence of human trafficking in selected high-migration districts (as the project has a focus on trafficking that takes place within the migration sector), and based on the research findings, it is in the process of developing a grass-roots level awareness campaign. “The project also supports the Government of Sri Lanka to ratify the protocol to the ILO Convention C29 on Forced Labour. However, Sri Lanka ratified the C29 more than 50-years ago,” Fernando said. “We are also conducting several training programmes for government officers on human trafficking, and we are in the process of collaborating with trade unions to introduce a website called ‘Migrant Recruitment Advisor’, where workers can directly share their experiences encountered in the recruitment process. It will be launched in local languages,” she added. According to the legal experts in the field, the Government maintained overall law enforcement efforts to address human trafficking. Accordingly, Section 360 (C) of the Penal Code criminalised labour and sex trafficking, and imposed penalties of 2-20-years of imprisonment and fines, which were sufficiently stringent. Meanwhile, Minister of Foreign Employment Harin Fernando said that stern legal action would be taken against those who involve in human trafficking/smuggling in Sri Lanka, and that he had ordered the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) to send relevant circulars to the foreign employment agencies. The Minister also said that a new agency rating system would be introduced to identify rogue agents engaged in human trafficking.  He further noted that the SLBFE plans to reintroduce an agency rating system to ensure such rogue agents are no longer in the system, which was last done in 2014.  Under investigation  Unlike in the past, when the system was fraudulently manipulated to give high ratings to agents, favoured by officials in the Bureau, an independent body is to be tasked with carrying out the assessment, Fernando said.  According to SLBFE, the Human Trafficking Controlling Unit of the Bureau had received 29 complaints from January to October this year, out of which 12 complaints were transferred to the Criminal Investigation Unit. Another 16 complaints were transferred to Special Investigations Unit. SLBFE maintained its ban on migration of male and female domestic workers younger than 21-years of age, and female domestic workers younger than 25-years of age to Saudi Arabia, and younger than age 23 to other parts of the Middle East and also required all female migrant workers below age 45 to submit a “family background report” to ensure the woman did not have children younger than age five. The Bureau said that its legal division filed 107 cases against licensed and 50 cases against unlicensed recruiters for fraudulent practices, compared with a total of 315 cases in 2016.  US State Department recommendations   As per the recommendations suggested for Sri Lanka by the Trafficking in Persons report published by the US State Department, Sri Lanka needs to improve efforts to investigate and prosecute suspected traffickers, including complicit officials, and convict and punish offenders with sentences equal with other serious crimes. The country should also, increase efforts to proactively identify trafficking victims and train officials on victim identification and referral procedures, specially to ensure victims are not detained or otherwise penalised for unlawful acts, such as immigration violations or prostitution, committed as a direct result of having been subjected to human trafficking. It also suggested improving the protection services to ensure identified victims, including men and children, receive specialised care services and to expand the SLBFE’s mandate to include the regulation of sub-agents and to promote safe and legal migration and ensure migration regulations do not discriminate on the basis of gender.

,,Private villas: Travel’s new normal?,brunch," By Naveed Rozais 

 Sri Lanka’s private villa culture is experiencing something of a boom in the wake of Covid-19. Traditionally considered to be a very exclusive (and expensive) travel arrangement, the last few months, for various reasons, have seen private villas becoming more and more accessible.  

 But what sets private villas apart as a travel accommodation option in the new normal in which we find ourselves?    The Morning Brunch    spoke to Sri Lankan villa booking management platform Ceylon Haven Founder Dilshan Rabbie to learn more.   

 Why do you feel there has been an increase in private villas of late? 

 Generally, the main incentives are the privacy and security that villas offer. With villas, something most people aren’t aware of is the fact that there are also more affordable and smaller bedroom-sized villas; what typically comes to mind is the extremely luxurious big-brand villas but there are lots of smaller villas providing more exclusive accommodation for small groups that give these groups more privacy and safety.  

Another edge villas have is the amount of personalisation they offer. The staff also doesn’t rotate as fast as a hotel, and personal preferences are easier to accommodation. For repeat travellers, it is the same staff that you see on your next visit.  

 These are a few reasons why villas are now in higher demand. 

 What impact do you feel the recent second wave of Covid-19 infections is likely to have on travel?  

 In response to the new wave, there have been quite a few cancellations, particularly for the month of October. Property owners are also concerned, and Ceylon Haven works very closely with the owners of the properties we partner with. If the owners or staff feel unsafe, we communicate this to our clients and see how else we can accommodate them. In the coming months, things will pick up again.  

 Right now, everyone wants to travel, but restrictions are a key concern – can they travel across borders? Can they travel in the same group sizes that they initially planned?, etc. The tourism sector has released a circular in response to the new wave of infections saying that all establishments must operate on 50% occupancy for the time being. Therefore, we need to provide a villa that is double the size of the group that is travelling.  

 What is Ceylon Haven and what role does it play in fostering villa culture?  

 Ceylon Haven is a platform built by locals for locals that features villas only. We saw that the owners of these villas were suffering because of the lockdown, not being able to pay staff and operate on their usual models. We wanted to drive more attention to these smaller properties that don’t have the same marketing capacities and budgets as big hotels. The big hotels were able to fill in their room nights with incentives and offers, but smaller properties couldn’t do this and no one was focusing on them.  

 The main intention for Ceylon Haven came from a very personal space. Our group of friends were unable to travel during the lockdown, and being at home for an extended period of time was frustrating. We began to look at how and where we would travel as soon as restrictions lifted and saw a gap in the market with the only accommodation booking platform being internal ones like Airbnb or Expedia. There was no local platform that made it easy to contact local properties, especially the smaller ones, and get information to see if they were open, what their safety precautions were, etc. There were a few villa renting websites, but the experience was not seamless and easy.  

 Ceylon Haven started in early June with a group of three friends including myself. We didn’t have the marketing budget to go all out, so we began by sharing Ceylon Haven among our friends groups. And now, the brand has been established. We have over 80 properties that have come on board, with much more interested in joining us as well. 

What sets Ceylon Haven apart is the customisation and personalised service we offer. Customisation is not a completely alien concept, but something that many people haven’t been exposed to is customisation on an affordable budget. People expect it to come at a high price point.  

 We work with our clients’ budget and see what we can do based on budget and group size, proposing properties accordingly and then working with clients on what meals and menus they would like, any transport requirements they may have, and briefing the staff at the property on their individual requirements to provide clients with a completely personalised experience.  

How do you see demand for villas and villa vacations evolving in the long term? 

 Villas will definitely gain a larger portion in the accommodation sector. Once restrictions are lifted, and even beyond, there will still be questions on safety and privacy. It does come down to preference; some people will prefer the big hotel experience with its buffets and its large pools, and the villa vacation experience is entirely different. 

 Villas have not always been accessible, and Ceylon Haven is bringing accessible world-class Sri Lankan properties into the limelight and exposing more and more people to this format of vacations. Through Ceylon Haven, there is someone clients can contact with the aim of making use of these properties and creating a memorable vacation experience.  ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Private villas: Travel’s new normal?,brunch,0,1602540056,0,100866,,
,,Promoting Ceylon Tea mid-pandemic,brunch," 
 	    Sri Lanka Tea Board’s innovative range of masks dyed using Ceylon Tea  
 
 By Naveed Rozais 

 While necessity breeds invention, or so the old adage goes, disruption breeds innovation.  

 In the midst of the pandemic, the Sri Lanka Tea Board (SLTB) has launched an innovative initiative to market the Ceylon Tea brand with a range of “Ceylon Tea-dyed” face masks. These face masks are being distributed to the diplomatic and international business community to promote the Ceylon Tea brand overseas in a memorable way in keeping with restrictions brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic.  

 The Ceylon Tea-branded face masks have undergone a value addition process with the usage of Ceylon Tea dye, a byproduct of the Agarapathana ice tea manufacturing tea factory.  

 The masks are naturally antimicrobial (AATCC 100) biodegradable, eco-friendly, and non-toxic. The extra benefit of using this innovative face mask is that it is reusable up to 30 washes. 

 The range of masks was launched on 29 September, with masks from the first lot of production being symbolically handed over to Ministry of Foreign Affairs Secretary Admiral Prof. Jayanath Colombage by SLTB Chairman Jayampathi Molligoda. Also present at this landmark occasion were Ministry of Foreign Affairs Director General Kandeepan Balasubramaniam, SLTB Director – Promotion Pavithri Peiris, and SLTB Market Promotion Officer Gayan Samaraweera. 

 The business of face masks has been booming ever since the coronavirus pandemic, making it one of 2020’s most essential and indispensable commodities. Through these branded face masks, the SLTB has adopted an innovative way of promoting the brand. The masks are being distributed in collaboration with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 

 SLTB Director – Promotion Pavithri Peiris shared that the masks will be shared with all 75 of Sri Lanka’s overseas diplomatic missions for them to distribute to end-users on a complimentary basis as a promotion tool for Ceylon Tea. Peiris also added that the masks would be made available for sale in Sri Lanka’s largest foreign tea markets like Azerbaijan, where Sri Lanka does not have a diplomatic mission.  

 Peiris explained that this initiative was devised by SLTB, considering the pandemic situation, as a way to promote the image of Ceylon Tea, while also talking about the health benefits of tea at a time when health and wellbeing are at the forefront of the global mindset.

,,Sri Lanka’s struggle to increase tax intake will exacerbate: Moody’s,business,"The coronavirus crisis will lead to long-lasting revenue losses for emerging market (EM) economies, with those already struggling to increase their tax intake before the pandemic, such as Ethiopia (B2 Negative), Sri Lanka (Caa1 Stable), and Pakistan (B3 Stable), facing additional hurdles, Moody’s Investors Service said in a report yesterday (12). 

 “In Sri Lanka, despite the implementation of the Inland Revenue Act in 2018 and other reforms to improve overall tax administration, revenue declined to 12.7% of GDP in 2019, from 14.1% in 2016 and a far cry from the 2019 budget target of close to 16%,” it said. 

 It pointed out that the ability of EM governments to implement and enforce effective revenue-raising measures in response will be an important credit driver over the next few years because of their sizeable spending pressures and the subdued recovery in the global economy expected next year. 

 “The coronavirus crisis has underlined the importance of revenue generation for emerging market governments,” said Moody’s Vice President – Senior Credit Officer and author of the report Lucie Villa. “For EMs, any fall in revenue is particularly important for creditworthiness because their government spending needs – social, infrastructure, and debt financing – are often more urgent than for advanced economies and they have a generally narrower revenue base.” 

 With the support of development finance institutions, EM governments will look to implement or resume tax-raising measures. However, only a few governments have successfully raised revenue much faster than GDP growth over the last 10 years, Moody’s said.

,,The players’ dilemma,sports," Winning the Collision by Shanaka Amarasinghe Imagine you’re a professional rugby player; even a very good one. And there are a few of those. Also imagine that you are a professional rugby player who is average. Just imagine it for a second. Professional players are a small percentage of players who play club rugby. School rugby has hundreds, if not thousands of players, and club rugby struggles to find 300-350 quality players without age restrictions. What happens to the plethora of school rugby players that don’t make the grade for club rugby, or are not interested in playing club rugby? The short answer is that we don’t know. Why players don’t pursue rugby as a career will become painfully obvious.  Life after sport  The ones who are brave enough to pursue rugby as a career are usually the better players from schools. In the last decade or so, the hours that they have to put in to become good school players are disproportionately long in most schools. Players – it is a well-known fact – rarely come to school, and almost certainly don’t attend class. Their academics are virtually non-existent, and 17-year-old rugby players are usually not the most discerning when it comes to thinking of ‘life after sport’. What this leaves us with is school-leavers with little else to take into the world, valuing the fact that they play rugby. Imagine their chagrin, then, when they find out that the only thing they’re equipped for is more than a bit of a let-down. Rugby players these days will earn 30-40k, if they’re lucky. Some of them, much less. As you get better, as you get more established, you may make a little more than that. Perhaps, 60k. The best players will get a stipend from the Union for their national representation. All told, the cream of the crop may make about 100k in selected months. With big paydays such as the Super Sevens tournaments in their various iterations being now obsolete, players are even more reliant on their paycheque.  Making hay while the sun shines  This reliance – mixed with the uncertainty of rugby’s future – sees players jumping from club to club like ticks in a pack of dogs. It annoys the die-hard fans, creates animosity in a small community, and makes players appear mercenary. However, from the players’ point of view, the club with the highest offer is the only one that serves their purposes. Passing judgment on them is the same as condemning professionals for moving jobs. Given that clubs are often cash strapped when paying insurance payments, players are rightly worried about their futures in the case of injury. Very often, clubs will support the players with surgical assistance and medical fees. However, they will not be able to support the players indefinitely in the case of a career-ending injury. These are concerns that the players are very alive to, and therefore, try to make as much hay as possible while the sun shines. It’s human nature.  Players feathering their own nests  It is obviously with heavy heart that players like Duane Vermuleun, Lima Sopoaga, and Aaron Cruden ply their trade in Europe. But it is also with a heavy wallet that they come back. Similarly, players move from Havelock to Longdon to Welisara to Nittawela, depending on where the unstable patronage moves. Unfortunately though, the thing about instability is, well…instability. Most clubs are short-term, and want to do well for the upcoming season. Whether that is at the behest of their political overlords, or one faction of the membership trying to outdo another, is immaterial. The fact is that they are short-term. And so are the players, with good reason. Clubs do not invest in players. They pay players. They buy big names for relatively big amounts of money, in the hope that these players can make the team greater than the sum of its disjointed parts. This rarely works. However, it does give the players some agency to feather their own nests. What suffers as a result is Sri Lankan rugby.  Increasing value of central contracts  Administrators care about their club result so that they can maintain bragging rights, and more legitimately – but less importantly – the support of their sponsors. Players need short-term gains. Unfortunately though, like Beauden Barrett who was a reserve for three years before becoming ‘World Player of the Year’ consecutively, rugby players, and consequently rugby teams, take years to build. This includes national teams that never profit from club vs. country rows. Many clubs were reluctant to send their Sevens players overseas, and you could almost see some players holding back during the Asian Sevens series. Why not? They need to stay fit so that they can get paid. For them, it’s about economic survival vs. body on the line. And that fight will have only one winner in the professional era. Until central contracts significantly outweigh the amount of money players can earn at club level, Sri Lankan rugby will continue to suffer in the doldrums. This requires sponsors and attractive rugby. Rugby is the sort of game witnessed between Tasman Makos and Canterbury in their Mitre 10 Cup semi-final. That brand of rugby will have the clubs heaving at their inadequate retaining fences.But this also means that there need to be better players. How do we get more money into the game without, first, having better, more skilled players? It’s a chicken or egg.

,,Sunny Side Up part 1,news,"Logo: Sunny Side Up                Dutugemunu to contest Prez Polls                        In order to salvage the country from the present crisis, ex-Minister and former Rajapaksa-strongman Mervyn Silva says he will contest in the forthcoming presidential election under a political outfit named after King Dutugemunu.       Addressing the inauguration and maiden gathering of the Heroic (Weera) Dutugemunu Organisation held recently in Anuradhapura, Mervyn Silva said his political outfit would contest on behalf of the Sinhala Buddhists of the country and was named after the most respected ancient Sinhalese monarch – King Dutugemunu – who according to Silva is in heaven.       “My hometown is Belliatta but I was the Member (of Parliament) from Tissamaharama, which is 50 kilometres away, where Prince Gemunu was born and bred. I started my journey from Tissamaharama Maha Viharaya (Buddhist Temple)  built by none other than King Dutugemunu’s father – King Kawantissa.”       Furthermore, he had the privilege of becoming the Member of Kelaniya where King Dutugemunu’s mother – Queen Vihara Maha Devi – resided, he added.       “After a lapse of nearly two millennia, I was able to build a pandol in Kelaniya which was founded by King Yatalatissa, who was a forefather of King Dutugemunu. Because I rendered yeomen service to Kelaniya even the Chief Incumbent of Kelaniya (Temple) still holds me in the highest regard.”       “I have no intention of making money and I am not involved in corruption or frauds,” claimed Silva adding that he has neither hatred nor any motif of revenge within him. “However, I earnestly make one request. Don’t try to use me!”               Meanwhile, Minister Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka said that Mervyn Silva would not muster even three votes in the event he contests any election.       Silva, who claims he is a descendant of King Dutugemunu, also plans to contest for the Chief Minister of North Central Province if the provincial council elections are announced first and is meeting with religious leaders and civic leaders of the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa Districts.       In June, Silva warned those who were using him that if they let go of his hand he will not be reluctant to take out the sword of King Dutugemunu.       Back in 2011, the then Minister Mervyn Silva starred as the main actor of the Sinhala movie “Surangana Lowin” – a fantasy film for children – with Silva playing the role of King Dutugemunu, who ruled Sri Lanka from 161 BC to 137 BC. In addition, he built a statue of Dutugemunu within the Public Relations and Public Affairs Ministry premises.       Albeit Mervyn Silva requesting his supporters not to (mis)use his name, has he himself forgotten that he is using the name of the most respected ancient Sinhalese monarch?               -----------------------------------        Big brother keeps a close eye on Lanka                        India is the closest global superpower influencing Sri Lanka and since it keeps close vigil over its counterpart across the Palk Strait, Sri Lanka should exercise extra diligence when dealing with New Delhi and not antagonise it by making reckless statements, experts on international relations point out.       The Official Spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs of India Raveesh Kumar recently tweeted a clip of Prime Minister Narendra Modi showing Sri Lankan Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe and his wife Maitree a cover of “Vaishnav Jan To” – a devotional song – by a host of international artists including BnS (Bathiya & Santhush), and Umaria. The video of the India Premier showing Mahatma Gandhi's favourite bhajan with enthusiasm to his counterpart went viral on both sides of the Palk Strait.       Raveesh Kumar tweeted (stet) Tribute to Mahatma Gandhi from our neighbour #SriLanka.

(stet)            Last week, Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena made headlines after Hindu reported that during the weekly Cabinet meeting, Sirisena told Ministers that the Indian intelligence agency – Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) – was “trying to kill” him, but “Prime Minister Narendra Modi may not be aware of the plan,” days before Wickremesinghe’s scheduled visit to New Delhi to discuss bilateral matters.       Later BBC reported that President Sirisena called Indian Premier Modi to deny the Hindu report, saying he ""categorically rejected"" it. Embarrassing headlines have plagued Sirisena in recent weeks. Last month, he raged at the country's national carrier – SriLankan Airlines – for serving him cashew nuts ""which were not even fit for dogs"".       Hindu also reported that the Cabinet meeting saw a heated argument between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe, when a Cabinet Paper on developing the Colombo Port came up for discussion, with the President reportedly being vehement in his objections to any Indian involvement in upgrading its east container terminal – a project that New Delhi has been keen to take up.               ------------------        Politicos, students under stress                          Due to the present socio-economic system, school children and even politicians are going through severe stress with some suffering from mental illnesses, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne iterated at the recently-held National Mental Health Day event which fell on 10 October.       Addressing school children and other participants at the National Institute of Mental Health he said that mental illnesses are clustered under non-communicable diseases.       “We as politicians also suffer from stress. Those who don’t have tension are living well. We must understand the reality. By worrying too much about day-to-day issues, people become more and more stressed out. Mental illnesses increased with commercialisation. In olden simplistic societies, mental illnesses were at a minimal level. Life was blissful.”       “However, during ancient times, barbaric methods were used to treat mental patients; but now we utilise modern healthcare. We have improved attitudes when looking at such patients. Developing primary healthcare, we have ensured Universal Health Coverage (UHC) as envisaged by the World Health Organisation.”       “Towards that end, communication is of utmost importance. Unfortunately, we have a destructive media culture. School children must be imparted with knowledge on mental health. Unemployment too causes mental illnesses. Our society must love and care for the mentally ill,” the Minister added.            ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Sunny Side Up part 1,news,0,1540635674,0,10091,,

The Head of the National Operation Centre for Prevention of COVID-19 Outbreak (NOCPCO) mentioned this joining the Derana 360° political program, last night (12).

“We have quarantined nearly 51,000 people at quarantine centers so far. There is no such thing as impossible. War heroes are prepared to quarantine any number of individuals at any given time on behalf of the people of the country.”

When asked on the origin case of the Minuwangoda COVID-19 cluster, the Army Chief said that upon investigations, 33 persons have been identified for displaying symptoms before the first Minuwangoda apparel factory employee diagnosed with the virus.

“Further investigations have revealed that cold and cough symptoms were prevalent from September 21, and sometimes even from September 15. Therefore, the employees must have contracted the disease between September 10 and 20.

,,PARADISE LOST? PRELIMINARY NOTES ON A CONSTITUTIONAL COUP,focus," By Asanga Welikala  There were three dramatic announcements on the evening of Friday 26 October, 2018 from the Presidential Secretariat, which occurred in the following order:  (a)   the announcement of the withdrawal of the UPFA from the government;  (b)  the swearing-in of Mahinda Rajapaksa before President Maithripala Sirisena as the Prime Minister; and  (c)   the announcement that the President has informed Ranil Wickremesinghe in writing that he has been removed from the office of Prime Minister under Article 42(4).  Even if the legality of the procedure and the clarity and meaning of the relevant constitutional provisions can be debated, the fact that the event was planned in complete secrecy, with no consultation of Parliament or giving the serving Prime Minister and Cabinet the courtesy of even a short prior intimation before the course of action was made public, that it was suddenly carried out on a Friday evening, and that it has taken the country by total surprise, point to some extremely questionable motives. Indeed, the whole set of circumstances suggest not the way a change of government ought to occur in a democracy, but the sharp practices associated with a constitutional coup, which is likely to lead to a constitutional crisis. It is a constitutional coup, because the serving Prime Minister has not legally ceased to function in office before a new Prime Minister has been appointed. And it will lead to an unprecedented constitutional crisis, because there are now two competing Prime Ministers and their parties jostling for power, authority, and legitimacy at the very heart of the state. Until one of these persons – Mahinda Rajapaksa or Ranil Wickremesinghe – can demonstrate that he has the confidence of Parliament through the support of a majority of MPs, and force the President to accept the will of Parliament, the crisis will not be resolved. Only time will tell what long-term damage this does to Sri Lanka’s constitutional fabric. After the 19th Amendment was enacted in 2015, the Prime Minister can only cease to hold office by death, resignation, by ceasing to be a Member of Parliament, or if the government as a whole has lost the confidence of Parliament by a defeat on the throne speech, the budget, or a vote of no-confidence [Articles 46(2) and 48]. Since the Constitution after the 19th Amendment specifies these ways in which the Prime Minister ceases to hold office, and has impliedly, removed the previous power of the President to remove the Prime Minister at will, it follows that there are no other ways in which this can happen. In particular, the President can only appoint another Prime Minister where the serving Prime Minister has lost office in any one of these ways.  It is clear that the serving Prime Minister has not ceased to hold office in any one of these ways. Rather, the President has purportedly removed the Prime Minister from office by acting under the provisions of Article 42(4), which states that the President shall appoint as Prime Minister a Member of Parliament, who, in the President’s opinion, is most likely to command the confidence of Parliament. The President seems to have taken these words rather too literally than is constitutionally permissible. When this provision speaks of the President’s opinion, it contemplates not, the subjective and personal opinion of the President as to which MP is best suited to be Prime Minister, but an objective and constitutional view formed by reference to who can command the confidence of Parliament. This is usually, although not always, the leader of the largest party represented in Parliament.  Prime Minister Wickremesinghe survived a vote of no-confidence by a substantial majority earlier in the year. No other canvassing of Parliament’s confidence has occurred since then, or before the purported appointment of Rajapaksa tonight, and therefore the President can neither constitutionally remove a Prime Minister who has not lost the confidence of Parliament nor appoint another in his place. It must also be stated that Article 42(2) speaks only of the appointment of the Prime Minister by the President and says nothing about the removal of the Prime Minister by the President. While the power of dismissal could be assumed as inherent to the power of appointment in the constitution prior to 2015, the 19th Amendment has changed this by now providing expressly for the specific ways in which the Prime Minister can be removed (under the previously noted Articles 46(2) and 48. That these procedures have not been followed render the purported presidential acts tonight illegal and unconstitutional.  If the parliamentary numbers have changed since Wickremesinghe’s confidence vote in April, in favour of a majority now supportive of Rajapaksa by among other things, the withdrawal of the UPFA from the national government – presumably the basis for tonight’s presidential acts – then it is also not clear why Sirisena and Rajapaksa did not choose to take the constitutional path to removing Wickremesinghe by defeating him in Parliament first. The crisis will be prolonged if Rajapaksa cannot swiftly demonstrate his command of Parliament, but the strategy he and Sirisena have followed tonight shows that they have chosen to seize the political initiative and momentum by the element of surprise, with the probable intention of consolidating their hold on the State machinery and in particular the Police and Armed Forces over the weekend, before conforming to constitutional and parliamentary niceties. They would also quite correctly have concluded that technical illegalities would not effectively be justiciable, because it is unlikely in the extreme that the Sri Lankan courts would risk a venture into such a high-stakes political game. This kind of behaviour of course is entirely normal in Rajapaksa, and to his credit, he has never pretended to be anything other than a banana republic presidential populist. But Sirisena was elected in 2015, exactly to instantiate changes to curtail this dubious and destructive strain in Sri Lankan politics. His descent from the heroic standard-bearer of high idealism to a despised villain of the lowest form of low politics has been truly Miltonian.

,,The thinking factor,sports," The Los Angeles Lakers are not favoured to win the NBA Championship this year. Indeed at best, according to experts’ predictions, they would barely make the playoffs. Yes, they have LeBron James – arguably the best basketball player on the planet at the moment – but he just makes the Lakers a single superstar team. LeBron is surrounded by highly talented but inexperienced youngsters, and a few veterans. It’s just not enough. And yet, with LeBron in the team, there’s this sense that the unthinkable could happen. After losing to Portland 119-128 in the season opener, and to Houston 115-124 at home, reality probably dawned. Sure, it’s a long season. Sure this is a new team with a new leader. But still.  LeBron playing with little boys  To make matters worse, Rojan Rondo and Brandon Ingram got involved in a spat, and were suspended for a couple of games. And when the Lakers trailed the San Antonio Spurs by almost a dozen points midway into the first quarter, the 2018-19 season seemed just a continuation of the dismal years. My friend Tony Courseault, an astute student of the game, and a great Lakers fan (like myself), was obviously not thrilled: “Getting killed. LeBron is playing with little boys.” Things have got so bad with that team that we have got used to celebrating small gains. Tony texted: “LeBron just took over on defence and got his team some easy fast-breaks.” He added “Josh Hart” and then “Ball has two 3s”. That’s Lonzo Ball, by the way. “What of Josh Hart?” I asked. The answer was “Sorry, looked nice.” And then “40-26, you don’t have to ask who’s winning”.  A 0-3 start  I checked the box score and noted: “LeBron hasn’t scored yet!” Tony was crisp in his response: “On bench. Passing before. Rebounding. Being the PG (Point Guard). Scoring is nothing.” Well, the play-by-play of that game shows how the Lakers fought back. Tony texted “close now”. I asked: “all due to…?” obviously suggesting ‘LeBron James’. He would later point out that LeBron set the time with fast-breaks and great ball-movement. LeBron, Tony said, insisted on players staying disciplined on their spots on the floor. As for him not scoring, Tony said: “Much ado about nothing. All the greats have had slow starts, or bad shooting games. The main thing is he's setting the tone consistently for this game.” That he did. The Lakers tied the game, and sent it to overtime. LeBron made a poor decision at the end, and the Lakers lost 142-143. That’s a 0-3 start.  Young guns fantastic  Prior to the game, in our own private ‘pre-game show’, I suggested that not having Rondo and Ingram would make it possible for Kyle Kuzma to have a big game. Kuzma had 37 points; the slow start notwithstanding LeBron scored 32 with 14 assists and 8 rebounds. Neither of us was disappointed by the final result. Tony put it in a nutshell: “It’s a blessing to have Ingram and Rondo out. Young guns were fantastic tonight. LeBron settled them down, and got them into a recognisable flow, offensively, and better communication, defensively. And Luke made all the great and timely substitutions. My pet peeve is not understanding or agreeing with coaches’ rotations – like Donovan in OKC [Thunder] – but I completely was in sync with Luke tonight.” (That’s Luke Walton, the Lakers coach).  Great thinkers at NBA  Our discussion moved to the great thinkers among NBA players. Tony listed: “Magic, LeBron, Kareem, MJ, Isiah, Bird, Dennis Johnson, Shaq, Jason Kidd, Pippen, Wade, Pierce, Reggie Miller, Rondo, Chris Paul, and Mark Jackson.” “Not Kobe?” “Super smart – outthought himself too much. There are too many times you'd watch Kobe about to take a bad shot, and shout at the TV ‘NOOOO!’ Same thing happens anywhere; sports bar, people in unison, at home with friends, at a party – anywhere – says a lot.” He added other names, and we talked about other things. Later he texted ‘top Twitter trending topic: Lakers fans saying Kobe would have made the last two FTs that LeBron missed’. “Kobe wouldn't have got  this  team out of the first quarter hole,” I observed. And Tony agreed.  Think about thinking  The whole thing got me thinking about thinking. Especially in the middle of things, and more so when the middle is a big hole! The greats in any team-sport, however weak the team may be, never stop thinking. They know to adjust. They know to get their teammates to adjust. They know how to focus, and how to get others to focus. They break things up into manageable sizes. They are relentless. As I write, the Lakers have just got their first W for the season, admittedly against the lowly Phoenix Suns (131-113). It might be another painful season for my friend Tony and me, but we will enjoy LeBron’s impact on the young Lakers team, I’m sure. In the very least, LeBron will teach us a few things about the importance of thinking, a prerequisite to outthinking the opposition, naturally.

 The National Trade Union Front (NTUF) has called on the Government to look into the 30,000 expired PCR antibody kits purchased for the Mulleriyawa Molecular Biology Laboratory, which was built by a Chinese company at a cost of over Rs. 250 million this year, due to non-use. 

 “We urge the Secretary to the Ministry of Health and the President of Sri Lanka to launch an immediate investigation to ensure that the Mulleriyawa Laboratory, which was built at great expense, was not yet another waste of foreign-funded projects that was initiated in the country.” 

 “If the Mulleriyawa Molecular Biology Laboratory had no necessity of the reagent kits at the time, these could have been distributed to other laboratories before the expiration date to minimise wastage,” NTUF Convenor Ravi Kumudesh explained.

 In a statement issued yesterday (13), the NCC urged the Government to make all the changes to the 20th Amendment available to the public.   

 “We call upon the Government to preserve those parts of the 19th Amendment that promote the independence of key institutions and accountable governance.

,,Proposed expressway projects: Expressway Investment Company to be set up,news,"By Maheesha Mudugamuwa 

 Cabinet approval was granted for a proposal submitted by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa in his capacity as the Minister of Finance to set up a state-owned company, Expressway Investment Company (EIC), to own and self-finance the proposed expressways. 

 Co-Cabinet Spokesman Mass Media Minister Keheliya Rambukwella said the company will be solely owned by the Secretary to the Treasury, with all expressways being taken under the particular company so that the proposed company is eligible to collect funds required for the construction of expressways, thus enabling it to collect income generated through expressway tolls as well as other income-generating means related to the expressways. 

 Addressing the weekly cabinet media briefing at the Government Information Department, Minister Rambukwella said that approximately 0.5-1% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) should be allocated towards financing the expressways already under the construction and scheduled to be constructed. Therefore, he continued, the Cabinet of Ministers has granted their consent for the resolution forwarded by the Prime Minister to incorporate the state-owned company, EIC. 

 He also noted that the Government had already taken steps to expedite the construction work of the pending expressway projects including the Central Expressway, Ruwanpura Expressway, as well as the Kelaniya-Athurugiriya Expressway in parallel to 100,000 km of road projects launched recently under President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s “Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour” manifesto and national policy framework.

,,Sri Lankan repatriations slowed following latest outbreak,news,"By Skandha Gunasekara 

 The repatriation process has slowed down significantly following the most recent outbreak of Covid-19 in Sri Lanka.  

 Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd. (AASL) Chairman Maj. Gen. (Retd.) G.A. Chandrasiri said that the number of Sri Lankans being flown in had reduced considerably. 

 “There has been a definite slowdown since the recent outbreak. Today (yesterday, 13), only one flight – an Emirates flight – is scheduled to come with around 45 people. I think the main issue is lack of quarantine facilities with the recent clusters.” 

 He said that prior to the recent Covid-19 cluster, far larger numbers of expats were being flown in. 

 “On average, 400 to 500 would come on a daily basis, while there were days when 700 passengers would arrive.” 

 Furthermore, he said that outgoing flights still continued.

,,Hazardous buildings in Kandy: Independent report to CP Governor,news,"By Sarah Hannan 

 The committee appointed to investigate potentially hazardous building structures in the Kandy Municipal Council (KMC) area presented its report to Central Province Governor Lalith U. Gamage on Monday (12). 

 Speaking to    The Morning   , Central Provincial Engineering Services Department Engineer W.M.A. Wickramasinghe said: “We have suggested several recommendations after carrying out investigations on 20 selected building sites in Kandy, with special focus on architecture, adherence to building regulations, geology, geotechnical engineering, water and sewerage management, to name a few aspects. 

 “The Governor’s Office is to study the report and then adapt the recommendations in a week’s time, after which the recommendations will be publicised.” 

 The report was prepared by a 25-member independent committee presided by Central Provincial Engineering Services Department Engineer Wickramasinghe under the consultation of University of Peradeniya Department of Civil Engineering Senior Prof. S.B.S Abayakoon. 

 The report on hazardous buildings in the Kandy City limits was ordered by the Central Province Governor's Office following the collapse of a residential building in Buwelikada on 20 September resulting in three deaths and two casualties. 

 The National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) submitted its observations to the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) on 21 September and confirmed that the cause of the disaster was linked to a weak foundation and miscalculation in the construction of the overall building. 

 The NBRO, on 1 October in its full-length report presented to the Central Province Governor, noted that the main reason for the collapse of the building was structural instability caused as a result of poor-quality design and construction.

,,Bring new constitution instead of 20A: Wijeyadasa ,news,"By Maheesha Mudugamuwa 

 Former Cabinet Minister, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) MP Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe requested President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to formulate a new constitution instead of introducing the 20th Amendment. 

 In a letter written to the President, MP Rajapakshe pointed out that in a situation where the country is facing a severe economic crisis triggered by the coronavirus, it was unwise to create a constitutional crisis and fight over it. 

 In addition, vehement opposition was also expressed among society against the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution, and the people who voted for the Government and the President had also become hopeless, he noted. 

 The law veteran stressed that he decided to raise his concerns over the 20th Amendment in a 10-page letter, as he and other ministers and MPs weren’t given an opportunity to express their opinions over the proposed Amendment; they were told there was no need to discuss the Amendment and that it would definitely be passed in Parliament by the President irrespective of the outcome of the meeting that was called at Temple Trees on 9 October to discuss the 20th Amendment. 

 Elaborating further, former Justice Minister Rajapakshe also stated that the two points expressed by Education Minister Prof. G.L. Pieris at the beginning of the meeting by were totally wrong. 

 Accordingly, the points, as explained by Rajapakshe, which were wrongly interpreted by Prof. Pieris, included the inability of the President under the 19th Amendment to remove the IGP (Inspector General of Police) and the Attorney General (AG), and to appoint a sub-committee within the Cabinet for economic activities and the holding of its chairmanship by former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. 

 The MP denied any connection between the two points raised by Prof. Pieris to the 19  th   Amendment. 

 Rajapakshe reiterated the negative aspects of the 20th Amendment under 10 subtopics in the letter. 

 The 10 subtopics include: removing of several presidential powers, abolishing of the commissions needed for the country including the audit commission and procurement commission, removing the limitations introduced on the number of cabinet and state and deputy ministers, enabling the president to dissolve parliament within a year from the inauguration, introducing provisions to present emergency acts, amending the law which disabled a dual citizen to become an MP or the president of the country, removing the Presidential Secretariat and Prime Minister’s Office from the Auditor General’s inspection, repealing the constitutional provisions which made it compulsory to audit an institution in which the state has shares of over 50%, removing the Bribery and Corruption Commission, and removing of the oath in the subsection for not dividing the country, which has already been accepted by the Justice Ministry which said it was a mistake.

The rugby fans here are sending their heartfelt condolences to this remarkable Trinitian. He passed away Friday morning at the Trinity staff quarters, and was 70-years-old at the time of death. He was the Trinity Sports Director, and was once the Asgiriya International Cricket Stadium Curator too. He first played rugby for Trinity in 1966. He is often remembered for the unforgettable Bradby Shield encounter of 1967, when Trinity retained the shield under the leadership of Ajith Abeyrathne.

,,Un-Usual Suspects by The Mad Hatters' Collective,brunch,"

 By Dimithri Wijesinghe  

 ""Un-Usual Suspects"", a short film by The Mad Hatters' Collective, directed by Mad Hatters Reihan Stephen, Kovindu De Seram, and Nigel Wayne White, premiered on 11   October 2020 on YouTube via The Mad Hatters' Collective YouTube channel.  

 Produced by Mad Hatters Nigel Wayne White and Eshan Thilakasena, the short stars Hemali Ratnaweera, Isira Edussuriya, Rashmi De Silva Wijeyeratne, and Visura Silva.  

 The content of the film features dark subject matter, discussing topics that are otherwise painted as taboo in our society. Written by Mad Hatter Nigel Wayne White, he shared that this was one of the first-ever scripts he had written, originally intended as a stage production. However, due to the subject matter and considering that he was still in school at the time, the timing simply did not align and so it was put on the backburner.  

 White shared that when he first wrote it, it was primarily because he wished to tell the story of a friend who had shared an experience with him, but he wished to do it in a way that wasn’t overt, and this is his way of telling that story.    

 When asked about why he chose to release the project at this moment in time, White shared that they really wished to carry on the momentum they’ve built up for Mad Hatters’, stating that they have a goal of presenting a couple of stage productions next year and they did not want to take a chance of an extended hiatus, despite experiencing difficulties during this time.  

 “It’s a topic that never really goes away; it comes in waves and we have shown different aspects. The script itself has since undergone several revisions to better shed light on these topics,” he said.  

 White shared that the next step for Mad Hatters', is an upcoming project titled “Trial and Error”, and the script has been adapted into a screenplay. As there is simply no funding for a stage production, they have opted to make a film and he said that they hope to release it by late-December or early-January. 

 All of this led up to their theatre ensemble – three different short plays of the whimsical fantasy genre, set to be staged around March or April and they hope to present their body of works to procure funding for the production.  

 The cinematography for the project was done by Yaseen J. Khan. We reached out to Khan, better known as @longweekendlk on Instagram, to talk to him about his experience as the Director of Photography for his very first short film.  

 Khan has extensive experience in video production, having shot travel content, music videos, and such. However, he shared that he had yet to take part in a project of this nature and it just so happened that this project came his way and everything kind of fell into place.  


 He shared that considering that this was his first time and also taking into account the subject matter, it did somewhat feel as though he was jumping into the deep end, adding that it was challenging. “The job is to create a creative visual to communicate the director's vision,” he noted, conveying that with this type of production where it is monologue heavy and the content is deep and meaningful, there is a certain pressure on his part to capture the moment when it happens; there’s not a lot of room for retakes.  

 “In any ordinary shoot, when there are various technical issues or you wish to have a retake, it is no big issue. However, in this scenario, where the actors must reach within themselves to give these performances emotionally, they go to a dark place. So, when they deliver their performance, if I do not capture it, then the moment has passed and they have snapped out of it,” he said, adding that “it was a sort of baptism by fire situation”.  

 The Mad Hatters’ Collective was originally founded in 2017 by Nigel Wayne White and Reihan Stephen, two St. Joseph’s College old boys coming from a primarily theatre background, and the initiative has since branched out to other mediums, like film. Since its inception, starting with two theatre directors coming together, the group has grown to include a five-person executive consisting of the two founders and Nethmi Gunasekera, Kovindu De Seram, and Eshan Thilakasena, who overlook its productions.

,,Sanga reflects on his World Cup performances,news," Strap line: Sangakkara turned 41 yesterday (27)  Kumar Sangakkara sent records tumbling with his performances at the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015. The Sri Lankan legend became the first player in history to hit three – and then four – consecutive centuries at the Cricket World Cup. On Saturday, he turned 41, in celebration we caught up with him to get his thoughts on all four of his record-breaking centuries at the 2015 World Cup.  1) 105 n.o. v Bangladesh  I went into the World Cup wanting to score as many runs as possible because that was my job for the side batting at number three. Coming into the Bangladesh game, where I got a hundred, it wasn’t a case of going in and getting a hundred, it was a case of we had a great start with the openers and my job was to go in there and accelerate the scoring rate. When you go into World Cups you want to win, you want to score runs, but it doesn’t always happen as you plan it, but this time I had a lucky run of form I would say. It just kind of clicked together [against Bangladesh]. I remember giving a chance when I was on 14, a tough caught and bowled chance. But, after that it was just trying to find the gaps and exploit the field. The MCG is a big ground, but I managed to do that. Sometimes when you’re in the zone you don’t question it, you just keep going with it and I managed to get a hundred.  2) 117 n.o. v England  Bangladesh was to set up a total and this was in a chase - England got 309, we did it with one wicket down which was very satisfying. I enjoyed batting, it was in Wellington if I remember correctly, the wicket was very flat. James Anderson, Stuart Broad, Chris Woakes, Moeen Ali, they had all the bowlers there, it was just a case again of building an innings and pacing yourself and trying to make sure you get ahead of the rate at different stages of the game. Again, we got a really good start from Dilshan and Thirimanne; it kind of eased me into my innings. Then, with the fielding restrictions prevalent at the time, it was a case of making sure we reversed pressure on the bowlers.  3) 104 v Australia  We fell short, so that was not satisfying! Again, going in we lost an early wicket. I went in to bat and watched Dilshan hit six consecutive boundaries off Mitchell Johnson, which was nice, and quite fun to watch! Again, it was trying to keep up with the rate, trying to score and make sure we didn’t lose too many wickets as well, but it was a tough ask. Then I eased into my innings chasing a very large target. We fell a few runs short, which was not great. It’s always better to score less runs and win than score a hundred and lose, but still it was a satisfying effort.  4) 124 v Scotland  That was in Hobart. Again, I was just going in and batting! We lost a wicket a little bit early, but it was just a case of going in and trying to repeat the pattern – get in, then go big. I managed to put on a really good partnership with Dilshan (195 runs), and it was really satisfying to keep performing. When you are scoring runs, you want to stretch that for as long as possible, and I was able to do that.

,,Second wave matrimony,brunch," 
             How is Covid-19’s second wave affecting weddings?  
 
 By Naveed Rozais 

 Marriage and Covid-19 have had an awkward relationship. Covid-19’s first appearance on the scene wrecked the wedding dreams of many couples looking to tie the knot in 2020.  


 Sri Lanka’s three-month lockdown meant the postponement or cancellation of the countless weddings that would have taken place during that period. The uncertainty and fear of mingling that Covid-19 brought with it meant that weddings taking place after the lockdown had to be scaled down (not entirely a bad thing, but certainly something to make guest lists more difficult to manage).  

 The lockdown and the wedding industry 

 The wedding industry took a big hit with the lockdown. The pandemic essentially changed the face of weddings as we knew it.  

 In May, restrictions introduced by the Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medicine meant that wedding guest counts had to be limited to 50% of the venue's capacity, up to 100 people. Physical distancing had to be strongly enforced with guests sitting one metre apart and adequate distance had to be maintained between different wedding zones like poruwas and registration tables.  

 Other changes to weddings were the banning of alcohol until restrictions were lifted and dance floors were discouraged.  

 All venues were required to give their clients instruction sheets outlining government regulations as well as any venue-specific regulations when bookings were made, and wedding planners and service vendors were asked to focus heavily on sanitisation and disinfection when setting up and dismantling weddings.  

 What does the second wave bring with it? 

 The second wave of Covid-19 infections does come as a blow. End2End Events Founder and Managing Director Melisha Yapa commented on the second wave, stating: “Things were just beginning to look up. We were imagining that things were going to be fine and people were starting to go back to normal. But now the uncertainty has come again and once more all plans are going up in the air.”  

 In terms of restrictions, the second wave doesn’t bring any new restrictions; it strengthens the restrictions that were already in place. 90F Weddings Co-Founder Anupama Nawalage shared that in many respects the restrictions haven’t changed. “We can still hold weddings following the guidelines that have been issued. Now, with the passage of time, there is a little more flexibility with public health inspectors (PHIs). Couples can meet with the PHIs or medical officers in the area of their venue and have their wedding looked at on a case-by-case basis and confirm how many people can be invited. The PHIs closely monitor this process.”  

 The lockdown and the wave of cancellations and postponements that ensued meant that many vendors have had to become flexible when dealing with things like date changes. “Overall, this shift started in April itself, and the flexibilities in policies introduced at that time are still being offered right now,” Yapa said, adding: “Everyone is being very flexible right now; I know of one hair and makeup artiste whose client had to move their wedding to a date and location that they couldn’t accommodate, and the artiste offered his client a full refund and recommended another stylist. People are going out of their way to make sure that couples do not lose out. My vendors and service providers have been nothing short of amazing.”  

 90F Weddings, whose primary service is floristry has also taken steps to make sure couples don’t lose out. “What we did as a company was put in place a policy of rescheduling for up to one year from the initial wedding date at no extra cost,” Nawalage explained, adding: “If a wedding is postponed by more than a year, there is a small change in cost of about 10%.”  

 The biggest challenge the second wave brings with it is uncertainty. Magical Moments Director Charm De Silva commented on uncertainty and the immediate future, explaining that previously scheduled weddings for October and November are mostly taking place as planned. “The weddings planned for a little later are uncertain. A lot of clients are frustrated I think. There’s no panicking as such, but that also depends on people’s personalities. Couples are now trying to make the best decision on whether to postpone or go ahead as planned.”  

 Nawalage also commented on the uncertainty of the industry at present, sharing that in an evolving situation like Sri Lanka’s at present, couples are also taking things as they come. “We can’t really confirm anything until the week before because of the uncertainty. We don’t know what will happen and which area may be locked down. There are quite a few couples who don’t want to postpone and want to simply have their wedding and finish it off; the logic being that they don’t know what will be happening in a few months' time. During the lockdown, most people thought things would be fine by September.” 

 Destination weddings: What can we expect? 

 Sri Lanka is a world-famous destination, and destination weddings play quite an important role in the wedding market, from completely foreign couples looking for a truly memorable wedding experience, to Sri Lankans living abroad who want to have their weddings back home.  

 De Silva from Magical Moments, who handles quite a few destination weddings, shared that the outcome is not promising in the short-to-medium term. “Some destination weddings have had to be cancelled entirely,” De Silva said, “The western part of the world is doing quite badly, and even from a Sri Lankan standpoint, travel seems unlikely. We are still receiving bookings for destinations, despite also receiving cancellations, but I don’t think anyone can say when things will pick up because we don’t know when the airports will open.”  

 Yapa from End2End Events also commented on destination weddings in Sri Lanka and the future. “Essentially, the word on the street is that there’s no date for airports reopening,” Yapa shared, adding: “Overseas guests coming in is definitely out of the question. But once we have got Covid-19 under control and reopen our airports with clear quarantine guidelines and protocols in place, Sri Lanka has an opportunity to become one of the safest places to have destination weddings. This will, of course, depend on how the Government deals with the situation and handles things once airports open up again. For the moment, overseas guests coming in is not going to happen, but locals holding their own version of a destination wedding might be possible sooner rather than later, depending on how this second wave goes.” 

 Moving forward 

 While the wedding industry does have its unique challenges during these turbulent times, marriage is not likely to go out of style anytime soon. What’s important now is for couples to remember that even though the big wedding they’ve dreamt of for years may not be possible, this in no way means that their commitment to one another is any less valid or powerful.  

 Yapa stressed the importance of remembering that the essence of a wedding is a couple choosing to share their lives with each other. “While everyone wants to have an amazing event to celebrate their special bond, at the end of the day, it’s about the two of them and their love for each other. It’s important to make sure that the stress, anxiety, and uncertainty of this tense time are kept at bay and for couples to move on with the rest of their lives together, even if it means postponing a big reception to take place on their first anniversary, or having a fancy reception later, so long as everyone stays safe and calm in the meantime.” ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Second wave matrimony,brunch,0,1602712853,0,101054,,
,,Andrew Siriwardena releases ‘Naa Mala’,brunch," Andrew Siriwardena (@assasinandie), a Sri Lankan civil engineer currently residing in Auckland, New Zealand has released his debut single titled “Naa Mala”, which premiered on 9   October.  

 The official demo reel has since been viewed by an increasing number of locals, who have expressed their intrigue over the unique melody, describing it as “haunting”, and the accompanying music video has garnered some attention as well.  

Naa Mala was produced by Tream X and was written by Andrew, who shared that he wrote the lyrics to the track upon hearing the melody that was shared with him courtesy of Tream X.  Speaking about his other collaborators and those who played a hand in the production, he said: “Jay Prince hopped on the track after he heard the song. After the song was mixed and mastered, we kind of knew that it had a good vibe.” 

 On the accompanying music video which has since been gaining considerable attention online, Andrew shared that it was not at first in the cards for them, adding: “The video came about after releasing the audio. I felt that there was a lot of traction and interest and it made me want to do a music video.” 

 He said that the video was shot by VeeMedia, which shot and produced a video that Andrew released prior to “Naa Mala” and he said that he was quite taken by his work and that he “liked his shots and angles”. The music video was finally edited by @nuwaaaan.  

 We asked Andrew about the conceptualisation of the project and how the song came to be, to which he replied: “Thinking back to how the song came about, the hook of the song ‘   oya naa mala nela waren, paya burulen thaba waren   ’ came about one day when I heard a Sinhalese kaviya on TV; it was so catchy and I loved the meaning, and the rest almost wrote itself, where my instinct was to go with a love song. The song became complete with Jay Prince's verse,” he said.  

 He shared that the video concept was inspired by a video by Gunner. “I wanted to create a sexy love scene but I wanted it to be shot in a creative and artistic way. My vision came together perfectly with the mastery of @tream_x_, Jay Prince, @rayanafonte, VeeMedia, @nuwaaaan, and @dinuk_2,” said Andrew.  
Considering that Andrew is a fresh face to the music scene, we asked him about his interest in music and how a civil engineer from Auckland, New Zealand ended up releasing a Sinhala language music video. Andrew shared that from the time that he was in school he has always had an affliction to music and that he was drawn to a lot of hip hop and RnB music, listening to international artistes like Drake and Eminem and local artistes like BnS and Iraj. He said that such artistes inspired him to write his own music, and with regards to pursuing music full time, he stated: “Yes, the dream is to become a full-time musician.” 

 Being of Sri Lankan origin, Andrew shared that despite his love for New Zealand and it being where he currently resides, Sri Lanka will always remain special. “Sri Lanka will always be my home and a lot of my inspiration for my music stems from there. Although New Zealand is a beautiful place to live, I would love to one day come back home to pursue a career in music,” he said.  

 He also referred briefly to the talent in Sri Lanka and the potential for growth, stating: “There are a lot of talented kids out there, with a lot of creative music talent; young producers and rappers/singers that have the potential that needs to be recognised.” 

 Finally, Andrew shared that in terms of the future, while at present he has no solid plans as of yet, he is in the process of doing a few collaborations with some artistes at the moment, and that he is in fact planning to continue to make more music. If you wish to follow his work, you only need to follow him on his social media for updates.

,,DIMO to enter agro tourism with park in Dambulla,business,"
 DIMO Agribusinesses, the agriculture arm of Diesel and Motor Engineering PLC (DIMO), has selected its agri techno park located in Dambulla to embark on its journey in agro tourism. 

 DIMO Agribusinesses owns three agri techno parks located in Dambulla (mid-country), Nikaweratiya (low country), and Lindula (upcountry, wet zone) which operate with the aim of carrying out research and development, seed production, and farmer education and training activities while also acting as a model farm in each respective region. 

 The company said it intends to enter the agro tourism market through these parks to cater to the growing number of tourists who are interested in an agriculture-based holiday experience. Tourists will have the opportunity to gain first-hand knowledge and experience about the agricultural way of life in the country while staying in luxury cabanas or holiday bungalows located inside these agri techno parks. The company officially opened two luxury chalets inside the Dambulla Agri Techno Park recently and said it expects to commence operations soon. 

 DIMO Chairman/Managing Director Ranjith Pandithage stated: “Agro Tourism is a vast area and this is our first initiative in this field. We have selected our Agri Techno Park in Dambulla for this project since it is equipped with high-tech agriculture facilities that enhance sustainable agriculture and is also situated in a beautiful location which will allow us to offer a real agricultural experience to the tourists.” 

 DIMO Group CEO Gahanath Pandithage said: “Agro Tourism is an important factor in the future tourism industry and many countries heavily focus on this area. Sri Lanka also needs to seriously look at agro tourism. These types of initiatives will have a positive impact on the companies’ profitability and it is great that DIMO has made its footprint in this sector.” 

 This agri techno park is situated in the Matale District of the Central Province, covering 30 acres of land. It facilitates knowledge transfer by acting as a co-ordinating hub to bring together expertise from established institutions and organisations in the areas of plant production, agribusinesses, and technology development. It will also provide planting materials of vegetable and fruit plants registered under the Department of Agriculture. The park will be armed with a knowledge sharing centre for farmers, students, and related parties.

,,"Surrounded by jungle, sea, and birds: Kadju House, Tangalle",brunch," By Jennifer Anandanayagam 

Submerged in water, beverage in hand, elbows propped on the side of the infinity pool, I was lost in my own world; a world where time stood still and what was before me – a gorgeous sunset peeking over a charming jungle-like setting – was the only thing on my mind.

This almost theatrical setting at Kadju House in Tangalle is easily one of its best allures – the pool looking over tangled vegetation which looks out onto the gorgeous sea beyond.

The stay at this boutique-style hotel was short but the memories are stored away for safekeeping, easily to last a lifetime.

We arrived at Kadju House on a somewhat overcast Friday in September, happy that the sojourn from Colombo took less than two hours via the highway and also happy that the space we were stepping out of our vehicle onto felt refreshingly different from what we left behind. What immediately greets you as you walk up the stairs leading you to the main accommodation area is how rustic the entire place feels.

Encased in its rustic elegance, however, is an intimate and minimalistic space. There are four en suite bedrooms, each with its own distinct style. The Sea Room is positioned in such a way where you can catch glimpses of the waves crashing on the sea as you lay in bed or soaked in the tub. You can also take in views of the vegetation below from the suite’s balcony. The Courtyard Room opens into its own secluded garden and comes with its own deck. The shower area is outdoor, open to the sky, shaded by a frangipani tree. The Pool Suite is somewhat cut off from the rest of the house, characterised by high ceilings, sea views, and also opens out onto a private deck and the gardens beyond. The Garden Room offers pretty views of the lush garden with fruit trees and comes with twin beds – perfect for children. The bathtub stands next to a lily pond.

The formal dining area, open to the garden, is made up of a long table. You are also welcome to dine on the terrace by the pool (hard to beat this offer), or at any spot in the lush garden or on the beach itself.

Pradeep Kodikara – the architect who designed Kadju House – won the Geoffrey Bawa Award for excellence in architecture in 2014 for his work on this property. The space seamlessly blends in tropical aesthetic with modern luxury. It was also listed in Condé Nast Traveller’s Best Beach Villas in the World.

“Kadju is the dominant tree on the property,” shared the owner commenting on how the place got its name. The villa also has quite a number of photographs of different species of birds on its walls. When queried, the owner admitted that he loves birds. “The birds in the photographs are birds we see on the property,” he shared, adding that deciding to bring in this element worked out well to blend art into the property.

“Art doesn’t have to be abstract if it’s real in that way.” The walls are largely bare, in keeping with the whole minimalistic vibe of the place.

The property was found in early 2000 but construction on it began only in 2007. Two years later, Kadju House was open to the market. “It was not meant to be a commercial property,” I was told; the owner fell in love with the white araliya tree on the property when he saw it. Assigning Kodikara on the project, resulted in the place taking on a beautifully minimalist aura albeit with the exception of the pool which he thinks adds a sense of “drama” to the entire place.

If you wish to move away from Galle and spend a quieter vacation nestled amidst vegetation and the surrounding sea, Kadju House in Tangalle is a must-visit. The boutique hotel is offering 60% off for residents. The place comes with breakfast and you can bring your own groceries and have the chef there cook the other meals for you.

,,A further burden on the masses,focus,"·       Local government bodies to increase taxes  By Maheesha Mudugamuwa  A majority of the local government bodies (LG) plan to increase rates and taxes next year in order to strengthen their financial stability, JVP councillors around the country alleged. According to them, a majority of the LG bodies had already decided to increase rates and taxes while some were still at planning stage. Recently, the Thissamaharama Pradeshiya Sabha had increased their rates and taxes by 500% which was a massive increase adding another burden for already tax ridden residents, a former JVP councillor of the Tissamaharama Pradeshiya Sabha S.N. Jayasiri told  The Sunday Morning . With the ever increasing cost of living and other national level indirect taxes, the people in Tissamaharama PS area were not happy with the decision taken by the authority, he stressed. Apart from national taxes, provincial and local taxation is also a significant part of the Sri Lankan tax system. The provincial taxation is bringing in only 4% of Central government revenue or 0.6% of GDP. But the provincial expenditure is around 11% of government revenue and the deficit is met by grants from the Centre, according to the government statistics. Accordingly, all properties within Municipal and Urban Council areas are subject to a rating levy. In Pradeshiya Sabha areas, only properties within “built up” areas are subject to tax. “Built-up” areas are declared by the Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministers from time to time. Every five years, all land owners of immovable property receive a notice of assessment tax changes from their respective local authority, which comprises of a rate demand on the property which may be land, buildings, easements, way leaves, holdings or any other type of property rights, they own or occupy. Speaking to  The Sunday Morning  Chandrasiri Paranawithana of the Mulleriyawa Kotikawatta Pradeshiya Sabha said that, a proper valuation of properties belonging to the PS area had not been conducted since 2012, and the current assessment rate of it was 9%. Asked whether the council was planning to increase rates and taxes, he stressed that the council should amend the existing taxes immediately. “It is unfair for the people in PS areas as their property valuation has been affected as a result of the council’s inability of amending its taxes on time. Whether it is an increase or decrease, they should amend it,” Paranawithana stressed. There are 330 local authorities comprising 18 Municipal Councils, 42 Urban Councils and 270 Pradeshya Sabhas in the country providing public services such as primary healthcare, public thoroughfare and community development and public utility services. These institutions also handle the preservation and development of the environment and revenue management. Rates and taxes and assessment of properties come under revenue management. A JVP councillor of Maharagama Municipal Council (MMC) Suraweera stressed that the MMC had not yet taken any decision on increasing the assessment taxes but they had not amended for over five years. For business premises, the rates and taxes was 14% and for non-business premises it was 7%, he explained. He further recalled that even though the MMC had not yet decided on any amendment of its rates and taxes, a majority of other municipal councils have already started to increase their taxes. The local authority is statutorily obliged to supply services to the inhabitants of the local authority area. These include local roads, water, electricity, waste disposal, poor relief and many more. They need money to provide these services. The rating income of a local authority goes to defray these expenses. Meanwhile the JVP Kaduwela Municipal Councilor Asitha Niroshan told  The Sunday Morning  that, the council was planning to increase its assessment taxes to 15% from the current rate of 9% from January next year. As a result of the conversion of Kaduwela Pradeshiya Sabha to Kaduwela Municipal Council, the residents living in the municipal area were being burdened with high taxes. The taxes for the business premises had been increased to 500% from 100%. “The water tariffs have also been increased by the council and as a result, the people are suffering,” he stressed. Kaduwela is now the largest city in Sri Lanka after Colombo, with 270,000 residents. It has a population density of 3,000 per square kilometre, he added. When asked for exact areas that the rates and tax hikes can expected, Niroshan stressed, “As per the information we received most areas were planning to increase their taxes.” The Mayor of Kaduwela Municipal Council Buddhika Jayawilal stressed that the council had not decided to increase the assessment taxes, and it was still at the rate of 9%. When  The Sunday Morning  contacted the Legal Officer of Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry Gayani Premathilaka, she said the local authorities derive their power to collect rates from the inhabitants by virtue of the local authority laws namely the Municipal Councils Ordinance, Urban Councils Ordinance and the Pradeshiya Sabha Act. These three Acts together with the amendments made from time to time lay down the code, legal principles and generally matters incidental to the imposition of rates and taxes by local authorities, she added. According to Premathilaka, the rate percentage was determined by a resolution of the Council and there is provision in the Act for preferential rating. According to the Census and Statistics Department statistics, revenue of Pradeshiya Sabhas from 2014 to 2015 was about Rs. 24,000,000 and of Municipal Councils and Urban Councils it was about Rs. 9,000,000. However, the JVP councillors stressed that many LG bodies around the country were increasing their taxes and the people could expect the rates and taxes increase by early next year. They alleged that even though the controlling and deciding of rates and taxes were solely under the purview of those institutions, there should be a proper monitoring mechanism to avoid any inconvenience to the public by implementing higher and unbearable taxes.  The Sunday Morning  learns that the implementing of rates and taxes of municipal councils, urban councils, and pradeshiya sabhas of the country were irregular and there was no proper valuation for the properties in most of the areas. According to JVP councillors, majority of these LG bodies increases their rates and taxes suddenly by higher amounts by adding more financial pressure for their tax payers.

,,‘Umbrella lovers’ and storks that bring babies: Love and sex in Sri Lanka,brunch," 
By Dinithi Gunasekera 

 
Forget about some rowdy boys leaving your French windows in pieces after a game of cricket, the auntie next door finding out that your great grandfather never actually owned acres and acres of land, or even worse, finding out that dishwashing liquid doesn’t taste half as bad next to any “delicacy” your daughter-in-law whips up. 

 In today’s episode of “What is the Worst Possible Thing that could Possibly Happen to a Sri Lankan?”, we present to you a child approaching his/her beloved    amma    and    appachchi    and asking inquisitively: “Where do babies come from?” 

 Suddenly you see them profusely perspiring with crimson-tinged brown cheeks, uncomfortable glances, and a stammer or two here and there, and what follows is the story of storks bringing a living being into the world. 

 In fact, our beautiful island is still so secretive with regard to matters of love and sex that you would be surprised at times to find a grey-haired couple displaying their affection for each other. 

 The issue extends to all too common examples of teens being severely punished by their parents for pursuing romantic relationships, to kids not knowing the difference between love and lust. It seems that in many ways, affection in its true and most human form is the forbidden fruit in our society. 

 The most recent example is the Police in Sri Lanka taking approximately 100 couples in custody, allegedly on the basis of “public indecency”. 

 Sadly, this is not news to the sweethearts and honeymooners of this country. In 2017, over 300 couples were arrested in Anuradhapura during a raid at a couple of parks. In 2010, in the same fashion, nearly 200 young couples were arrested and detained for “indecent behaviour.” 

Oh, the sin!
 From a legal perspective, these arrests are apparently made citing age-old colonial laws – Section 365A of the Penal Code and Section 7 of the Vagrants Ordinance, to be precise. 

 Human rights activist and journalist Kaushal Ranasinghe, in conversation with    The Sunday Morning Brunch   , expressed: “One of the major problems we face in Sri Lanka is that we still live in the Victorian culture of slavery that emerged during the colonial era. Their restrictions on love and affection based on religious beliefs at the time still operate in the minds of the people. Love and affection are therefore viewed as sins in society.” 

 Section 365A of the Penal Code and Section 7 of the Vagrants Ordinance, which are used to legitimise these arrests, date back to 1883 and 1842, respectively. 

 The systematic discouragement of issues of love and sex are doubled with added intolerance by the common man. 

 Through a number of interviews conducted among the youths of Sri Lanka, who wished to remain anonymous, we gathered that this notion is harnessed through and through. Here’s what they shared: 

 “We were at a café studying, and all the while slightly leaning onto each other, and the café manager told us that we won’t be tolerated because they are a café and it’s only for ‘working people’ – whatever he intended by that.” 

 “I have experienced that even people of my own age have asked me to sit apart from my significant other when they see someone older pass by. I think it’s the fear of being scolded which stems from conditioning in schools and households.” 

 “I was once at a café and the smoking area overlooks this single solitary house, and there were these people – couples – just hanging around. Suddenly, a guy came out of the door of that house with a broomstick and started shouting at them and asked them to take whatever they were doing inside because people live in that house.” 

 “I was in the restaurant area of a renowned supermarket once with my girlfriend and a couple of friends. My girlfriend was sitting on my lap but other than that, there was nothing going on. I wasn’t even hugging her. All of us were having a casual chat when an employee called us a disgrace and ordered us to leave. We left.” 

 “I have certainly got an occasional creepy stare and a judgmental look from an elder; apparently, it’s not normal for youths to act like this. Hence, shady corners and cheap ‘hotel’ rooms come into play.” 

PDA in Sri Lanka
 Public displays of affection (PDA), in addition to being discouraged by society, is now a punishable offense. 

 “I think Sri Lanka’s issue with PDA is that most of society doesn’t know how to mind their own business. They are constantly looking at what other people are doing and are in fact keeping tabs on other people’s problems. That’s why we can’t stand to see two people being affectionate with each other. It’s not wrong to be affectionate. It’s actually something that should be appreciated,” shared Bernadine Rodrigo, a law student. 

 “Of course, there’s a certain degree of affection that can be accepted publicly, but people holding hands or hugging is actually sweet and should be appreciated, especially with all the gruesome, violent things that are happening in the world. 

 “I think it also comes with the practice of simply not being open. Sri Lankans dwell in secrecy and are often embarrassed about very normal things. I think if people just learn to be more open and honest, accepting a certain amount of PDA wouldn’t be so difficult.” 

 Another youth shared: “I honestly think that people have the right to proclaim that they aren’t comfortable with PDA. Different people are differently tolerant to physical affection. However, if your disapproval is based on sexual prejudice and/or if your actions can physically or psychologically harm someone, then you should be held accountable.” 

What else is taboo then? 
 If the most basic aspect of romantic attraction is taboo, what is indeed expected to be discussed of the more physical aspects? The fact that affection is frowned upon seems to be the effect of more pressing matters from which it stems. 

 “As a result of misconceptions about sex among children, there are many times I’ve come across children who think that kissing or touching can lead to pregnancy. I believe we need to have an open dialogue with the child about love and sex,” expressed Ranasinghe. 

 This is where the necessity of sex education comes into play. Although the taxonomy is off-putting to many at first glance, sex education is a broad term used to talk about not only sexual intercourse, but also many other aspects of human sexuality, anatomy, relationships, sexual health, and human development. 

 It remains a controversial topic in several countries, specifically in Asia, concerning the age at which children should start receiving sex education and the amount of detail to be revealed. It is specifically controversial in religious and cultural norms in which abstinence is practised and preached. Engaging in sexual activity for pleasure instead of reproductive purposes, pregnancy outside wedlock, and masturbation appear to be the main concerns. 

 One such golden opportunity to bring sex education to the forefront was the    Hathe Ape Potha   , which was to be introduced to the Grade Seven curriculum. Unfortunately, it saw strong opposition. 

 “They stated that this book should be burned,” related Ranasinghe, speaking of his experiences at a panel discussion regarding the book. “It is more useful for children living in rural areas than those living in cities.” 

 “A survey I conducted in this regard revealed that 40.5% out of the 350 participants in the survey had encountered some sort of problem due to the lack of sex education. Lack of proper sex education is one of the main reasons why they fell prey to sexual bribery, sexual harassment, and sexually transmitted diseases,” he added. 

 Police reports submitted to the United Nations (UN) from 2012-2020 records 142 cases of rape, 42 serious sexual abuse cases, and 54 cases of child abuse just within the first 15 days of 2020. With such alarming numbers of sexual violence, Sri Lanka is indeed in need of a reality check. 

 “The longer this topic is not talked about openly in society, the more it will benefit rapists and criminals. Many who oppose discussions on this topic are such people,” Ranasinghe stated. 

Sex is normal  Rohini Wijeratne Kavirathna[/caption]

 “Sex is the normal state of living beings. Culture is what distorts it. However, what sets man apart from other animals is that he is born with a brain that can control emotions. That requires understanding, and knowledge is needed for understanding. How can knowledge be acquired without openness?” former Sectoral Oversight Committee for Education (Sub Committee) Chairperson and former Sectoral  Oversight Committee for Women and Gender Member MP Rohini Wijeratne Kavirathna questioned. 

 “As emotional beings, it is natural for people to be in romantic relationships. Today, Sri Lankan society talks about sex in secret, which may be due to factors such as our culture, civilisation, religion, and so on,” Kavirathna stated. 

 Change can only be brought forth by tackling the issue from the grassroots level itself, which is why it is essential that children should be made aware. 

 “Today, children have no choice but to live in a very insecure environment among adults. In my many years of experience as a schoolteacher, I have seen many children who have been raped or abused by their loved ones and were unaware of it. There are many instances where those children are in danger due to lack of knowledge.” 

 In the light of the    Hathe Ape Potha    project which was initiated and promptly dismissed by certain parties, Kavirathna revealed that those who oppose it today had not yet presented an alternative. 

 “According to sociologists and psychoanalysts, many criminals are victims of child abuse. In many opposing societies, children are being abused and cannot escape their situation even knowing the few things contained in the book.” 

 Kavirathna feels that it is essential to educate the children as well as adults. “Do you know how many people, not only children but also adults, suffer from this misunderstanding of sex? In addition to countless suicides and unsafe abortions, instances of marital rapes and sexual abuse plague our society in the aftermath.” 

 She further stated that there is an urgent need to develop people’s attitudes, adding that people need to change the attitude that the other sees sex as the enemy. 

 “My personal opinion is that social awareness is very valuable. Whether the child is a boy or a girl, they are the future of the country. It is our responsibility as adults to do everything we can to protect them,” affirmed Kavirathna in conclusion. 

 “It’s ironic how our Police follow colonial laws to this day, while the countries that imposed these laws back in the day have re-established theirs to fit the modern times. We as Sri Lankans hide behind the overused excuse of ‘preserving our culture’, while criminalising and demonising the display of consensual acts of affection; it will inevitably lead to non-consensual physical and sexual abuse behind closed doors,” stated Paramie Muthukuda, a final-year medical student at the University of Manipal. 

 Until the umbrellas that our young lovers hide under become unnecessary, and until    amma    and    appa    teach kids where babies really come from, there would be little to no change in the news headlines that report the abuse and the suffering of many innocent lives.

,,Imported rice stocks: Genetically modified say farmers,news,"By Skandha Gunasekara 

 The farmers’ unions charged that the imported rice stocks are genetically modified crops and that they are poisonous for human consumption. 

 “These crops are poisonous to humans but the Government spends billions to import metric tonnes of these crops for our people to consume,” All Island Farmers’ Association President Namal Karunaratne said. 

 He charged that the imported rice claims to have a shelf life of two years, which is far beyond the usual shelf life of rice. 

 “Normal rice will begin to crumble and waste soon after a period of four months. But the packaging on the imported rice claims that it would expire after two years. How can this be possible if it is natural? Clearly, these are modified crops, and are unhealthy.” 

 He added that this was also how the Government orchestrated the scam. 

 “Because this modified imported rice doesn’t expire fast, they can store it for a long period before labelling it as animal feed, and polish it before selling it for human consumption at high prices. This rice would still be fresh even after all that, because it has been enhanced using chemicals and other methods.” ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Imported rice stocks: Genetically modified say farmers,news,0,1602797456,0,101174,,

,,National security is key for social development: G.L.,news,"
 By Sarah Hannan 

 Minister of Education Prof. G.L. Peiris said that the economic downfall the country experienced during the 30-year civil war and the post-war period was greatly due to successive governments failing to ensure national security for the people of Sri Lanka. 

 “It is meaningless to talk about national development without ensuring the safety of the people. The primary responsibility of a government is to provide security to its people. The people empower a government to provide for the needs of the people in a formal and peaceful manner,” Prof. Peiris said. 

 The Minister pointed out that ensuring national security is a priority for social development and is essential to allowing the people to reach their full potential. 

 “Attracting investors to the country was a difficult task in such a climate. Moreover, the post-war period after 2009 was dedicated to forgetting the pain and hatred war had left behind, forging unity and solidarity, and rallying people to establish national unity, which extended to the then governments having to work towards developing the country whilst ensuring good governance prevailed; unfortunately, those conditions were suppressed,” Prof. Peiris elaborated. 

 The Minister of Education further pointed out that the inability to understand the aspirations of the majority of the people over the last four years clearly displayed that the reconciliation efforts had failed to address the issues faced by minorities and led to a catastrophe. 

 Prof. Peiris shared these sentiments as the Chief Guest at the 13th International Research Conference held at the Kotelawala Defence University yesterday (15). ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,National security is key for social development: G.L.,news,0,1602797452,0,101178,,
,,No private buses from 7 Nov,news,"By Sarah Hannan 

 Private bus owners yesterday (15) announced their decision to halt route operations with effect from 7 November. 

 Speaking to  The Morning , Lanka Private Bus Owners’ Association (LPBOA) President Gemunu Wijeratne said: “We are already running at half the capacity after the health authorities informed us that we are only allowed to transport people under strict health guidelines. The recent wave has proven that the virulence of the coronavirus has increased and that people who essentially do not sit in close proximity too can contract the virus, should they be travelling in a long-distance bus.” 

 Wijeratne noted that, given that people have stopped using public transport, the fleet which is in operation has been cut down to 10,000 out of the entire private bus capacity of 20,000. They are also working to facilitate the commute for schoolchildren who are sitting the GCE Advanced Level (A/L) examinations over the next few weeks, he said. 

 “Although we agreed that we would continue to operate given that this is an essential service the public needs to access, our association members, drivers, conductors, and helpers are once again facing financial difficulties, since there is not enough income to cover the lease or wages,” Wijeratne elaborated. 

 He pointed out that the Government failed to deliver on the agreed concessions or provide the Covid-19 insurance to private bus owners as promised, placing them in a very inconvenient position at present. 

 He added that even the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) fleet will not be able to cope with the present situation, as it would have to operate at a loss, given that there are insufficient passengers accessing its services.

,,Increase number of inspectors: PHIUSL,news,"By Maheesha Mudugamuwa 

 The Public Health Inspectors Union of Sri Lanka (PHIUSL) yesterday (15) said that while the number of Public Health Inspectors (PHIs) in the field was manageable at present as the inspectors were engaged in tracing the first, second, and third contacts of the Covid-19-positive cases, there needs to be an increase in the number of inspectors.   

 PHIUSL Secretary M. Baalasooriya told  The Morning  that considering the number of reported cases at present, the available human resources is able to handle the ground situation, but said it was better if the number of PHIs could be increased, as it is not something that can be done on short notice. 

 According to him, the total number of PHIs in the country was around 3,000 while the number of nurses was around 36,000 and there were 20,000 medical officers and 13,000 midwives. “When comparing all these numbers, the number of PHIs should be increased,” he stressed. 

 As per World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines, a preventive care officer should be appointed per 10,000 of population. “In Sri Lanka, we have one PHI per around 15,000 of population,” he said. 

 The Secretary, however, noted that the contact tracing of Covid-19-positive cases had not been affected and that steps had also been taken to recruit 115 new PHIs in Colombo, Kalutara, and Gampaha.

,,Preventing disasters on shifting earth,focus,"  Photos Indika Handuwala    Box   Box Headline:   Human interference influencing landslides   The NBRO Director R.M.S. Bandara, in an article published on the Vidurava (Vol. 22 No.02), stated that human intervention could influence incidents of landslides. 1. Denudation of forest areas exposing the top soil which affects the stability of a slope. In return, the soil cracks and erodes during heavy rainfall. 2. The use of land without planning. 3. Constructions on hill terrain without investigation or adherence to compatible designs. 4. Mining and quarrying activities without due investigation. 5. Obstruction of natural water paths and storage of water on high ground. Bandara further elaborated that by adapting soil conservation methods and establishing suitable drainage systems, the stability of the slopes can be reinforced. He noted that landslide-struck land should be reforested to protect the exposed soil, tying soil layers that tend to slide on the ground with wire mesh at staggered anchor points, placing concrete or rubble retaining structures, and anchoring unstable sloping ground with reinforced concrete posts, timber posts, or iron fence posts pile-driven into the bedrock.   ------------   By Sarah Hannan  Earth continuously transforms with the changing climate, earthquakes, weathering, erosion, volcanic eruptions, forest fires, landslides, floods, tsunamis, and cyclones. In addition to these natural causes, human led activities such as mining and deforestation too can cause the earth to give way. A few weeks ago, the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO), after observing the impending hazard of a landslide in the Ambagamuwa town of Weligama Grama Niladhari Division bordering the Castlereigh Reservoir, arranged the relocation of four families to Delpathkada Community Hall, averting a major disaster. Landslide Research and Risk Management Division Acting Director Dr. Gamini Jayatissa, explaining the relocation process, noted that early warning signs were observed in the area in August, with the area being a hotspot for landslides. The residents raised concerns to the Nuwara Eliya District Divisional Secretariat, who then informed the NBRO District Office in Nuwara Eliya. “We deployed our team to assess the situation and issued a report through the NBRO to the Divisional Secretariat. Following our instructions of the impending hazard, the Divisional Secretariat had allotted land for these families to relocate,” Dr. Jayatissa explained. The families were relocated to temporary safe houses on 9 October and the landslide occurred on 15 October. “A family is allocated a land area of 10-15 perches and the Government issues them a grant of Rs. 1.2 million so they could construct a house. In an event the family already had a plot of land in a less risky area, the Government would provide them a grant of Rs. 1.6 million,” Dr. Jayatissa clarified. Dr. Jayatissa further stated that it is challenging to relocate every family that lived in landslide-prone areas. Therefore, the NBRO conducted awareness sessions in landslide-prone areas to educate the residents on how to build structures on slopes (see image 1). When contacted, New Weligama Grama Niladhari Officer Nishantha Gamini Kumarage stated that the families were at present housed at a temporary safe house. According to Kumarage, Hill Country New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development Minister U.P. Digambaran and Central Province Governor P.B. Dissanayake discussed the handover of the earmarked land plots to the displaced families by November. “The temporary road that was paved during the landslide is still used by commuters. However, the Road Development Authority is rehabilitating the main road at present,” Kumarage added.   Early warning and preventive measures   The NBRO in the past two decades have actively carried out research studies in landslide-prone areas and have identified locations that are sensitive to natural disasters. As of today, 12 mountainous districts – namely, Matale, Kandy, Badulla, Nuwara Eliya, Kegalle, Ratnapura, Kalutara, Moneragala, Galle, Matara, Hambantota and Kurunegala – have been mapped based on the relative contribution of geological, topographical, land use and land management attributes(1). The result of those field studies along with both national and international expertise in the fields of geology, geography, geotechnical engineering, hydrology, and sociology resulted in developing a probabilistic methodology for landslide hazard zonation by the NBRO. This was followed by the establishing general guidelines for construction and development in landslide-prone areas. In order to better understand the zones NBRO commissioned the 1:10,000 scale maps (see image 2) to be drawn for extensive field study and evaluation of six causative factor attributes and their sub factor elements:  1.  Range 2,000 – landslides have occurred in the past; and Range 6,000 – subsidence rock fall:  Known danger of landslides with perennial threat to life and property exists. New construction prohibited. Measures to halt and reverse the process of slope degradation should be in place. Early warning systems to be established at all problematic sites.  2.  Range 4 – landslides are most likely to occur:  Danger and potential threat to life and property exists. No new construction permitted. Additions to the existing structures may be allowed only after thorough site investigation and adequate precautions to be certified by specialist(s). Early warning systems should be established if symptoms of landslides are clear and risk levels are high.  3.  Range 3 – landslides are to be expected:  Moderate level of landslide danger exists.

Mitigation work started in January, 2009 for Peradeniya and Padiyapalella by the Landslide Research and Risk Management Division (LRRMD) by applying structural methods such as construction of retaining structures and construction of surface drainage. The mitigation process for Mahawewa in Kumbalagama was implemented with the support of the Government and the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA). Installation of automatic rain gauges, extensometers and strain gauges, and monitoring the surface movement to study the controlling characteristics of the landslide are completed under JICA assistance.

,,Stigmata’s ‘Sacred Spaces: Solve et Coagula’ - Official music video out today,brunch," 
             Official music video out today  
 
 By Dimithri Wijesinghe 

 The official music video of    Sacred Spaces: Solve et Coagula    will be premiering on the Stigmata YouTube channel today (16), which is the second single to the fifth and most recent album released by the veteran homegrown heavy-metal band celebrating 20 years of music this year.  

 Having been around for two decades now, the band has made a name for themselves for being innovators in their genre, evidence for which is them releasing their fifth album; choosing not to opt for the traditional route of recording and releasing a full-length album in one go, they have released one single at a time, allowing for their listeners to live with each piece of music before the other was made available to them. 

 Considering the band has become renowned for their nuanced approach to writing, recording, releasing, and performing music, we spoke to frontman of Stigmata Suresh De Silva to gain a bit of insight into their most recent project. 

  Sacred Spaces: Solve et Coagula    is the second single to their most recent album, released on 25 July this year. It was preceded by their first single    Alyssa    which was a drastically different track in its entirety in comparison to    Sacred Spaces   . Suresh shared that    Alyssa    was a very personal story, adding that Stigmata as an entity are first and foremost storytellers. With this first single, they put together a very personal and emotional piece – an ode to pets that are no longer with us – presenting to us Stigmata’s take on the perception of loss and losing. 

 The music video to the same was also released for the track and that too was approached in an honest and raw format where they chose to showcase images shared by real people of their pets who are no longer with them. 

 Suresh stated that during their two decades in music, they have taken care to never repeat or recycle a theme or topic – they have taken that on as a challenge, and as a progressive metal band, they have worn this badge of honour proudly. As one would expect, they promise great things with this upcoming music video as well. 

 About this second single    Sacred Spaces: Solve et Coagula   , Suresh said it is the polar opposite of    Alyssa   . 

“The themes of    Sacred Spaces: Solve et Coagula    is a mix of what we consider sacred space mixed in with elements of alchemy. ‘Solve et Coagula’ is a Latin term that deals with the principles and basics of alchemy, while the song overall looks at how we hold dear spaces in our lives – whether physical, emotional, or psychological – that we value. Sometimes valuing these spaces can bring about the positive, and at times they may be negative and be a cause to hinder us. 

 “The song looks at this and deals with the concept of needing to do away with the old in order to create something new. Musically and thematically, it is expected to resonate with audiences differently,” he explained. 

 Speaking about the upcoming music video, Suresh shared that it will neither be a tradition nor conventional music video, noting that there will not be any live footage of the band and that concept was purely storyboarded to be a different experience. 

 Describing the music video without giving too much away, Suresh said it is sure to intrigue; while he said that they do not have live footage of the band performing, the music video will contain elements of Stigmata and will be focused on a dedicated story arc. 

 “You can expect a lot of symbols, metaphors, etc. and it is likely to really surprise a few people – it might even scare some, but our fans will all appreciate the art,” he said. He said they worked on the video for about two months and that the song in itself is a long track – it is six-and-a-half minutes; in comparison to today’s commercial music, this is almost a feature length piece. 

 We asked Suresh about some of the challenges they have come across in putting together a music video at a time like this where there are limitations in gathering people into spaces, and he shared that a large portion of the music video consists of graphics, some animation, and a lot of special effects and therefore was mostly done remotely. He said it felt quite irresponsible for them to get together a production crew at a time where globally social distancing is advised. 

 Speaking more about the video, Suresh said that growing up in the 80s and 90s, the music videos of the time were phenomenal, stating that they were often story-based and heavy in detail – a time when the visual representation is just as important as the auditory experience. He believes in this and therefore they have opted for a music video that will convey their story. 

 He said, however, that he is a firm believer of letting the art speak for itself, adding that the audience should be allowed the opportunity to enjoy it in their own terms and share their own personal interpretations to your work. Once your art is out there, the people listening to it are the ones who make it what it is to them. 

 Suresh said that they are a self-sufficient band, and leaving aside their music, they are professionals in their daily lives and bring to the table their expertise as those in the creative industry. Therefore, they have put together most of the art work themselves. However, this time around, he said that it has been their great honour to have worked with Grammy-nominated producer Romesh Dodangoda on the mixing and mastering of the tracks for the entirety of their fifth album, and to be one of the only Sri Lankan acts to have worked with him up to date, which also ensures that their audio is on par with anything out there in charts globally. 

 Finally, Suresh shared that the music video is something thought-provoking and entertaining to look forward to and that he hopes that it will be received well.

,,Manufacturing and services PMIs expanded in September,business,"The Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMIs) for both manufacturing and services activities expanded in September, the Statistics Department announced yesterday (15). 

 Manufacturing 

 Manufacturing activities expanded at a higher rate in September 2020, compared to August 2020. This expansion in manufacturing PMI was mainly attributable to the increase in production and new orders, especially in the manufacturing of food and beverages and textiles and wearing apparel sectors, the Statistics Department noted.   
  Some respondents in the manufacturing of food and beverages and textiles and wearing apparel sectors highlighted that their factories operated at full capacity, receiving more new orders with the normalisation of business activities. Further, the employment sub-index increased in line with these developments. Further, the stock of purchases sub-index increased at a slower pace in September. The suppliers’ delivery time sub-index continued to lengthen at a higher pace, due to issues in logistics such as shortage of direct shipping services.   
  Some respondents highlighted that the restrictions imposed on the importation of some categories of goods continued to affect the smooth functioning of manufacturing activities. The sub-index of overall expectations for manufacturing activities for the next three months declined significantly due to the prevailing situation of the spread of the Covid-19 virus in the country, particularly centring to some manufacturing zones. 

 The world outlook  

 The global manufacturing PMI recorded a value of 52.3 in September 2020 with an increase of 0.5 index points from August 2020. Manufacturing PMIs of India, the US, and the Eurozone continued to expand at a higher rate while those of the UK and China expanded at a slower rate in September 2020. Further, the manufacturing PMI of Russia contracted during the month with the adverse impact of Covid-19.

 Services 

 The services sector continued to expand for the fourth consecutive month with the PMI recording 54.3 in September 2020 compared to the previous month. This was underpinned by the expansions observed in new businesses, business activities, and expectations for activity compared to August 2020, indicating a further recovery of services sector activities. New businesses, particularly in the financial services and insurance sub-sectors, improved in September 2020 with the gradual normalisation in economic activities. Business activities also expanded in September 2020, yet at a slower pace. The financial services sub-sector was the main contributor to this expansion with increased financial facilities provided to support the businesses, which were negatively affected by the pandemic. Further, respondents in cargo handling services cited that they were able to handle more transshipments in September 2020.   
  Moreover, business activities related to the insurance and professional services sub-sectors also expanded during the month. The employment sub-index almost reached the 50-threshold level in September 2020 after a continuous decline in employment for seven months. Backlogs of work continued to remain in the negative territory, indicating that any increase in demand can be met with the existing capacity.   
  Meanwhile, Expectations on future business activities increased further in September 2020, with the positive sentiments which prevailed on the recovery of the economy in the second half of the year. Nevertheless, some respondents expressed concerns on the realisation of their expectations due to the re-emergence of the risk of the spread of the Covid-19 virus in the country. 

 The world outlook 

 The global services PMI declined to 51.6 in September 2020 from a seven-month high of 52.0 in August 2020, signalling an expansion in global service activities for the third consecutive month. The services PMIs of the US, China, and the UK indicated that their services sectors expanded in September 2020 compared to the previous month, while those of Japan and India indicated a deterioration.

,,People need a corruption-free administration: Nagananda Kodituwakku,news," Quotes: It would have been better if President Sirisena had waited till they had the numbers in Parliament before appointing a new Prime Minister because anyway Ranil Wickremesinghe would have had to step down as a result of the UPFA leaving and making the Cabinet unlawful  Minority parties should protect the interests of the minority communities; unfortunately the main party of the minorities is the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and they don’t have the interests of the Tamil community  There is a group of criminals willing to do anything to keep the leadership under their control and rob the nation. The entire Parliament is a group of criminals. I openly say that this country is being ruled by a group of criminals  By Skandha Gunasekara While noting that the change in the post of Prime Minister was constitutionally justifiable, prominent attorney-at-law and public interest litigator Nagananda Kodituwakku charged that the entire Parliament was a den of thieves, and that the current political development was a great opportunity for the masses to come to this realisation. Below are excerpts of his interview with  The Sunday Morning :     Q: What is the constitutional justification for the change in Prime Minister?   A:  The President has absolute power. Article 4 (b) of the Constitution is in the President elected by the people. Article 46 of the Constitution says that the number of ministers in the Cabinet cannot exceed 30 but in the Cabinet we have about a hundred people because it was a Coalition Government. However, when the UPFA left the Government and the Cabinet, the Cabinet became unconstitutional. Therefore, the Prime Minister cannot hold office anymore. Article 46, says that the Prime Minister can hold office as long as the Cabinet is there but the Cabinet is no longer there. Of course it would have been better if President Sirisena had waited till they had the numbers in Parliament before appointing a new Prime Minister because anyway Ranil Wickremesinghe would have had to step down as a result of the UPFA leaving and making the Cabinet unlawful. This constitutional change is therefore justifiable.     Q: In the event of a deadlock, does the Supreme Court have the authority to make a ruling?   A:  Yes. Under section 125 of the Constitution, that is the only authority to hear any issue pertaining to the interpretation of the Constitution. But it is very unlikely this matter will be taken to Supreme Court as I believe this matter will be resolved through Parliament.     Q: How long can Parliament be prorogued without passing the Budget?   A:  The Budget has to be passed. The Budget is the annual fiscal policy statement of the Government. Without that the Government cannot function or operate. Everything will become unlawful if the Budget is not passed. I don’t think it will come to that. One side will have to show numbers in Parliament before that and move forward.     Q: What will the minority parties do?   A:  It is  very likely they will choose the side that offers the deal. Whether it is the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) or the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) – whoever gives the better deal to them – the minorities will align themselves with that faction. That is the only thing of worth in this country nowadays – deals. They must have already had closed-door discussions.     Q: What should the minority parties do?   A:  Minority parties should protect the interests of the minority communities; unfortunately the main party of the minorities is the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and they don’t have the interests of the Tamil community. The Tamil people very openly say that the TNA is not their representatives; they are just a bunch of rogues. They have repeatedly said that they have no confidence in the TNA, that the TNA does not represent the interests of the Tamil people and that they too are criminals. That has even been proven in the Supreme Court with regard to the car permit matter. Almost all the TNA MPs have sold their car permits.     Q: Is this the change the country needs right now?   A:  No, not at all. The people need a clean, corruption-free administration. Both these parties are equally corrupt. The United National Party (UNP), the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the President, and all these political parties, including the JVP are corrupt. People are yearning for a corruption-free government that will serve the desires of the people in this country. Unfortunately that is not there. That is why we are fighting. We are fighting for a cause to restore the true representative democracy in this country. The representative democracy right now is there until the first time they obtain the vote. After the vote is obtained, they just go their own way and work for their own benefit. They must respect the will of the people. If they respect the will of the people, they won’t do things like bringing in the 20th Amendment. The UNP used the JVP as a tool to bring in the 20th Amendment and the Supreme Court completely rejected it. They have no respect for the people. I will never say that Sri Lanka has representative democracy.   Q: Where is the country headed?   A:  I believe all this is happening for the betterment of the nation. It is a great opportunity for the people to understand that once again this fact has been proven – that there is a group of criminals willing to do anything to keep the leadership under their control and rob the nation. The entire Parliament is a group of criminals. I openly say that this country is being ruled by a group of criminals.

The Department of Government Information said 68 of them were linked to the Minuwangoda cluster. Accordingly, 22 were found from quarantine centres while the remaining 46 were close contacts of Minuwangoda apparel factory employees.

In addition, 06 arrivals from foreign countries were also confirmed to be positive for the novel coronavirus yesterday: 03 navy men and 03 from the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

The Epidemiology Unit says 1,851 active cases are currently under medical care at several hospitals around the country. Meanwhile, the total number of recoveries from the virus sits at 3,380.

Further, Senapura and Wattala areas each reported one positive case while Kandana and Colombo areas reported 03 and 02 virus-infected persons, respectively.

The Army Chief further said, when a Covid-19 patient is found, it appears to be a separate case and their contacts tell the authorities that they have not associated with anyone linked to the cluster. “We have observed that most people do not have a clear understanding of how they become a contact [of a coronavirus-infected person].”

Speaking on the COVID-19 case found from Tissamaharama area, he said it was confirmed that the patient is a tour guide in Yala. “This person had made an appearance at a wedding in Tissamaharama. It had been attended by a group of people from Gamapaha who are linked to the Minuwangoda apparel factory.” He meanwhile added that one of the floors of the HNB head office in Colombo has been isolated following the detection of a coronavirus case.

The Army Chief also spoke of the COVID-19 infections found from Matugama area recently. “The owner of a bus and its driver had tested positive for the virus. The bus in question had transported passengers who visited the Colombo National Hospital. A nurse attached to the Hospital who travelled in this bus then tested positive for the virus.

,,Goodbye Mr. Perseverance!,news,"The most successful left-arm bowler in the 141 years of Test cricket history is retiring from the game after the first Test, against touring England, starting in Galle on Tuesday, 6 November. His name is Herath Mudiyanselage Rangana Keerthi Bandara Herath who, in life, had nothing much to show: Money, background, influence, good looks or outstanding talent. His is a story, a remarkable story, written with guts, perseverance and unrelenting drive towards achieving a life goal – a rare case for any youngster.  A rarity  He started schooling in Mayurapada Central College, Narammala. He was a son of an ordinary family. His average height 5’5” elicited jokes from his friends. He was not “a mystery bowler” but an ordinary left-arm leg-spinner. He was not “a lucky fella” having to play second fiddle to the great Muralitharan for the best part of his career: A plain character – not a fashionable persona. Yet this lad from Kurunegala has “brushed shoulders” with the all-time greatest of the game: Warne, Anderson, McGrath, Walsh, Kapil Dev and Richard Hadlee. He is presently the 10th in the all-time best bowlers’ list with 430 scalps. He can be the seventh in it if he takes five more in Galle.  Never to lose  Almost a decade, he was left in the doldrums not having a chance in the Tests. As the opportunity came his way, when he was 30+, Rangana was ready to go. Over 400 of his 430 victims fell against an “old” Herath: A record speaking volumes of his determination. Herath’s could be the longest stay in cricket in our times. He scalping Ponting, in his 1999 debut Test in Galle now look a shot from an archived movie.  Hero of generations  He belonged to a deferent generation which had not touched a smart phone at school, never had a Facebook account; a “tab” meant a mere tag or a flap for them, they knew only females, not emails. After all, Rangana was loved, loved by a vast cross-section of cricket fans, across a couple of generations. The reason was that they knew he played for them, for the country.  Nothing was more vital for him than winning for his motherland. So this man can linger in the hearts of the Lankans for years to come, not only as a record-breaker, but as a lovable chap who always fought for a cause.

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) yesterday (15) raised concerns over the state sector’s capacity to hold Covid-19-positive patients with the sudden increase in the number of cases due to the new Minuwangoda cluster.

The association, however, said it had made several proposals to the Government in order to control the ongoing pandemic. The proposals included reconsidering the testing method applied, changing the government policy on PCR testing, and increasing the number of tests conducted.


In addition, the proposals also included increasing human resources at the Epidemiology Unit of the Health Ministry and PCR laboratories and increasing hospital capacities without affecting emergency services rendered, depending on the severity of symptoms.


In a media statement issued by GMOA Secretary Dr. Senal Fernando, the association stressed on the importance of sharing the information gathered by the Epidemiology Unit so as to mark the same in a map using GPS technology, thereby restricting movement within red zones; reconsidering Covid-related instructions given to hospitals; and updating the guidelines issued when quarantining the health staff in case of a reported case.

,,This is a complete betrayal - Gamini Viyangoda,news," Quotes: We knew that there was a conspiracy between Rajapaksa and Sirisena from the very beginning but we never expected this to happen. The President’s decision clearly shows that those who are in power are willing to do anything to be in power  We can’t compare the present situation with what happened in 2015 because the President obtained the people’s mandate to appoint Wickremesinghe as the PM. The UPFA members of that Parliament didn’t oppose that. They didn’t object. They didn’t say it was illegal or unconstitutional Not only the FCID, even the Criminal Investigation Division (CID) and all other independent commissions will not be functioning in the future. That is why Rajapaksa took the Government into his hand  By Maheesha Mudugamuwa Co-convener of the Purawesi Balaya Organisation Gamini Viyangoda yesterday said that President Maithripala Sirisena’s decision to remove Ranil Wickremesinghe and appoint former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the new Prime Minister was against democracy as well as humanity. He told  The Sunday Morning  that the President should be impeached and the decision was illegal, as it was against the provisions of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. Following are excerpts of the interview:   Q: At the last Presidential election, civil society organisations supported Maithripala Sirisena in his bid to become the President and to establish good governance in the country. But on Friday he appointed former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister and removed Ranil Wickremesinghe from the post of Prime Minister. As a part of civil society that supported Sirisena, what do you think about the present political situation in the country?  This is a complete betrayal of the Sri Lankan people and the biggest betrayal since the country gained independence. But we predicted this from the day President Maithripala Sirisena decided to give nominations to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to contest from the Kurunegala District at the last general election. We knew that there was a conspiracy between Rajapaksa and Sirisena from the very beginning but we never expected this to happen. The President’s decision clearly shows that those who are in power are willing to do anything to be in power. That is exactly what President Sirisena did on Friday. They have clearly violated the Constitution and therefore this appointment is illegal. As per the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, a new prime minister cannot be appointed in the way the President did on Friday. And also what would happen if President Sirisena died? Then PM Rajapaksa would be automatically appointed as the president. How constitutional is that? As per the 19th Amendment, no person who has been twice elected to the office of president by the people shall be qualified thereafter to be elected to such office by the people. So now the whole political system is in trouble. This is what a president shouldn’t have done. He did not even respect the people’s mandate. A majority of UNPers voted for him to become the president. The people voted for him as he promised to appoint Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister.   Q: Do you think ongoing investigations against the members of the former government will come to a standstill?  Actually, the UNP-SLFP Unity Government failed to fulfil the promises they made as they didn’t prove a single corruption case against the Rajapaksas and they tried to protect them. This is the only reason why Rajapaksa joined Sirisena. They wanted to stop the investigations and end all cases against the Rajapaksas and their gang. There are corruption cases against the present government members as well, but the President cannot make it an excuse. In whatever circumstances, we can’t justify unconstitutional decisions taken by a president. He is the President and this will be a bad example for the young politicians in Sri Lanka.   Q: What do you think will happen to the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID)?  Not only the FCID, even the Criminal Investigation Division (CID) and all other independent commissions will not be functioning in the future. That is why Rajapaksa took the Government into his hand.   Q: How do you compare the situation in 2015, when the President appointed Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister, who did not have the majority in Parliament, and the appointment of Rajapaksa as Prime Minister in 2018?  We can’t compare the present situation with what happened in 2015 because the President obtained the people’s mandate to appoint Wickremesinghe as the PM. The UPFA members of that Parliament didn’t oppose that. They didn’t object. They didn’t say it was illegal or unconstitutional. They all accepted PM Wickremesinghe because he got the people’s mandate. Today, the situation is different. This is unconstitutional, and the President had no reason to appoint Rajapaksa as the PM.   Q: Now the UNP is looking at bringing an impeachment motion against the President. Is this the way forward for the UNP?  Yes. I think the President should be impeached as what he did on Friday was not suitable for a democratic country. We can’t blame Prime Minister Rajapaksa because we all know that he is a cunning politician; but we can’t accept what the President did. What he did was against democracy as well as humanity.

,,"Little Friends of Sri Lanka takes part in their first online academy: ‘Stop Talking, Start Planting’",tabloids," By Chiori Higashi, Plant-for-the-Planet Co-ordinator 

Plant-for-the-Planet, and international organisation, together with the United Nations (UN)’s The Billion Tree Campaign, has been planting more than 14 billion trees in more than 130 nations and training more than 80,000 climate justice ambassadors globally at the Plant-for-the-Planet Academy in a one-day workshop.
Plant-for-the-Planet was established in 2007 by Felix Finkbeiner, a nine-year-old boy from Germany. He came across Wangari Maathai, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who planted 30 million trees in 30 years, and was inspired. He then presented an idea at school to plant one million trees in every country.
This was the second collaboration with Little Friends of Sri Lanka Girl Guides to organise the “Academy” in Sri Lanka. The Academy is a unique event designed to provide participants with high-quality training and networking opportunities around core priorities. The first Academy was held in December 2019 at the Sri Lanka Girl Guides Headquarters which was a great success with the participation of 64 children aged eight to 14 from 37 different schools islandwide.
United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Representative in Sri Lanka Ritsu Nacken was a special guest and her speech on Greta Thunberg’s story inspired the participants. Nandakumara from the Forest Department of Sri Lanka and Thuru Co-Founder Hasanka Padukka were also the guests who shared their knowledge on how trees are important and how to plant trees.
Whilst Academy events happen in more than 70 countries, this particular online Academy was a very new idea that Climate Justice Ambassador Miku Higashi (15-year-old) proposed to the Headquarters in Germany about seven months ago due to the current pandemic situation. She decided to spend her time and energy on the implementation of the online version of the Academy as her personal project in school. This second Academy, which was held on 11 October, was the first English online Academy in the world. It saw the participation of 16 children from three different countries (Sri Lanka, Australia, and Japan), 11 different schools, and home-schooled children aged nine to 15, with an additional five helpers as the co-moderators of the Academy.
The Academy began with some welcoming words by Sri Lanka Girl Guides Chief Commissioner Visakha Thilakaratne, who initiated this collaboration since last year, and also by Plant-for-the-Planet Co-ordinator Chiori Higashi, who has been organising the Academy. Miku was the main moderator with Henry, Dawa Yangki Grace Sherpa, Huirong Yang, Eleez Omar, and Thevuni Sadhinsa Kumarasena as co-moderators of the Academy.
The participants learned about environmental issues and climate justice. They also shared their individual experiences of what they’ve done for the environment. Climate Justice Ambassador in Japan Ryua Yamamoto (11) gave a presentation as a tree speaker. Children went around their houses and counted as many products made of a tree as they could. They learnt about how important trees are to us. Since this was an online Academy, Miku introduced how to plant trees online on a website she made. Then, we practised how to speak in public to motivate more people and raise more awareness among the public or the media, we brainstormed how we take action, and also discussed future action plans in school groups or individually. We had many small group discussions that gave children more chances to share their experiences or opinions.
In the closing ceremony, the new Ambassadors presented their future action plans. Thuru Co-founder Hasanka Padukka, Little Friends of Sri Lanka Girl Guides Commissioner Nanduni Wickramatunga, Sri Lanka Girl Guides Deputy Chief Commissioner Sulari Jayawardena, and Plant-for-the-Planet Co-ordinator Winnie Chikhwaya joined as guests to listen to children’s action plans and gave some comments. Padukka shared on his environmental activities which are social innovations that introduce new technologies like the “Thuru App” to accelerate reforestation, and those stories encouraged the children in their plans.
This online Academy used a website that Miku developed as a tool. All participants were appointed climate justice ambassadors and received e-certificates.

 

 A report from a participant 

 By Kimalka, Little Friend of Sri Lanka Girl Guides/Plant-for-the-Planet Ambassador 

On the morning of 11 October 2020 at 7.40 a.m., I logged on to an online class. The online class was the Academy for the Plant-for-the-Planet programme. At 8 a.m., we started to introduce ourselves and got to know our leaders. There were participants from many countries including Japan (it was amazing!).
After that, one of the conductors gave us a presentation and quiz. The presentation was on how the Plant-for-the-Planet programme started. After that, she gave another presentation on the endangered animal species around the world and global warming. Then, we did speech training, which was about learning how to present. After which we were divided into small groups. Each group had a small paragraph to present to the entire group. Then, we learnt how to plant a tree online (shocking, right!).
After that, we had a small programme called “World Café”. It was a group discussion within our divided groups. It was about planting trees.
Then we discussed how we can take action to tell more people about the Plant-for-the-Planet programme. This was whilst in our divided groups. After that, special guests came online to say a few words. Then, it was time to present our action plans (I presented it for my group). After that, the new ambassadors (which is us) had to reflect on the activities of the day, following which, the leaders had to reflect as well.
I mentioned that it was a great learning experience and made some friends and the group discussions were particularly fun! Then, the guest speakers spoke. After their small speech, it was time to take the group photo. Then finally, it was time for the closing remarks.

 Feedback from participants 

· I enjoyed this event. It was great. This event taught me how important the environment is and I enjoyed the group discussions and making new friends. I also learned that it is important for each of us to do our part and help the environment and plant trees (11 years old)

· I learned how to save the environment and the planet. I know now that our planet is going to be destroyed. So I thought I should take action to plant a lot of trees when and where I can, and also to spread this message to the community to plant trees to safeguard the planet. I loved today's Plant-for-the-Planet workshop (11)

· It was the best! It inspired me a lot to save the world. I wish you will keep more academies like this, and I hope I will be able to join your Academy. Thank you so much for inviting me. We learned a lot about the environment. We planned our goals. We did group discussions. We learnt how to do presentations, and also guests came and gave inspiring speeches (12)

· I had the chance to share ideas with children from different countries, and the presentations, group discussions, and questions were very useful and fun. It was not boring until the end of the Academy. The lecturers were kind and helpful (12)

· At first, I was a little scared to participate in this programme since I’ve never joined a programme like this, but actually, there were a lot of people like me, so I could relax and enjoy the Academy. I thought this was a really good opportunity for people to learn about environmental issues and also become friends with people from different countries (15)

· I learned how to save the environment and much more. I felt really happy during this session. I gained deeper knowledge about the environment, such as how to save the environment, what actions we should take to save the environment in the future, facts about global warming, and also much more (10)

· Before taking part in the Academy, I had some knowledge on global warming, factors contributing to it, and what actions could be taken to mitigate the ill effects living beings would be facing due to that. I learnt that if we start acting promptly, in little ways, we can make a big difference. We can do things every day, at an individual level, such as being conscious to preserve energy and water; at the family level, such as being vegetarian for one day a week or planting a tree on special occasions; at the school level by making a talk/presentation to increase awareness; and in the community too, by talking about it often and inculcating the practice of planting more and more trees. I'm so grateful to the organisers for giving us this opportunity. I am determined to contribute my best to making this planet a better place for all living beings (12)",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,"Little Friends of Sri Lanka takes part in their first online academy: ‘Stop Talking, Start Planting’",tabloids,0,1602961544,0,101290,,
,,Jed fights asthma,tabloids," By Kusumanjalee Thilakarathna  

This week on the Little Stars cover is Jed Fonseka, a six-year-old warrior who not only fights asthma but also takes pride in raising awareness about asthma to support other kids struggling with the illness every day. He works really hard to raise awareness on respiratory diseases and dreams of making a progressive impact on people in Sri Lanka. Together with his parents and with the help of his doctor, he leads the campaign #jedfightsasthma. This is what Jed shared with  Little Stars  about his journey.

 Jed, tell us about yourself. 

 My name is Jedidiah Fonseka. You can call me Jed. I just turned six years old last week. I attend OKI International School, Primary Branch, in Kandana. And I’m in Grade Two. I have one sister. Her name is Noya. We have a pet dog named Tubby. I enjoy colouring, playing with Lego, and watching movies. My favourite movies are Sing and Sonic. 

 Tell us about your favourite things. 

 I have a lot of favourite things. I absolutely love Marvel superheroes, and my favourites are Captain America and Spiderman. 

 I go for piano classes and I can play just a little. As a hobby I love to act for TV commercials. 

 Can you tell us more about your acting career? 

 I started acting when I was 18 months old. In my first corporate profile for a client I had to eat a piece of papaya, and the director said I did a job well done. Ever since, I have done many TV commercials, corporate profiles, and modelled for clothing brands. 

 In the description of your Facebook page, you’ve said that you are a child influencer. What do you mean by that? 

 An influencer is someone who can make an impact on the community. I have worked really hard to raise awareness on respiratory diseases. I want people to know the severity of breathing problems such as asthma and lung disease. 

 I hope to one day make an impact in Sri Lanka where people would know how to respond when children or adults have an asthma attack and that asthma can be controlled with proper medications and lifestyle changes. 

 Although asthma is not a rare problem among kids, we rarely speak about it. Why did you choose to speak publicly about asthma and raise awareness? 

 Asthma is not the only respiratory disease. We have diseases such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), asthma, etc. that cause problems in the lungs. I was born with severe respiratory distress syndrome, and was on a high frequency ventilator (HFV) for four weeks. My stage was critical as due to the lack of oxygen (desaturation), I had a brain haemorrhage and also cardiac problems. 

 Our lungs are very important for all our organs to function. The lack of oxygen in our body puts a strain on our other organs, which leads to other complications. 

 Wheezing is common in a lot of children, but asthma is not. An asthma attack is very painful and is a chronic lung disease. I wanted to raise awareness about asthma because all children deserve good medical care and we have to somehow equip our government sector hospitals with the facilities to help us asthmatic kids. 

 How has your experience educating other people been? Tell us about the projects you’ve done so far. 

 So far, I’ve noticed a lot of people reaching out to my Ammi and myself, asking us about the doctors who take care of me and about the treatment I am on. I’ve also noticed that people are now asking us about the pros of using inhalers and controlling wheezing and asthma. 

 My Ammi does a lot to help me raise awareness and always encourages me to understand that even though I am in a constant battle with a respiratory problem, I am still a kid and I can have a normal childhood with proper precautionary measures in place and proper healthcare. 

 Because of my Facebook page and the awareness campaign, a lot of people have acknowledged that they need help and have even understood that some myths brought down by our forefathers are not true. My #JedFightsAsthma campaign has touched the hearts of a lot of people who want to support my goal to raise awareness amongst the general public. 

 Who is supporting you? 

 My Ammi and my Dada. Even my little sister, Noya. My Ammi helps me with my social media page, and my dada designs my #JedFightsAsthma t-shirts. 

 It is not easy, as my asthma attacks are sudden, and my parents have to keep a close and watchful eye on me all day long. But, they do it with no complaints and always reassure me that I am special and I am loved. My paediatric chest physician Dr. Channa De Silva and my immunologist Dr. Suranjith Seneviratne are fantastic too. They are always in touch with my Ammi and encourage me to stay fit and active, even though I sometimes find it hard to do so. 

 How are you catching up with your schoolwork with all the hospital visits and awareness campaigns? 

 My school is awesome. My Branch Co-ordinator is Mrs. Christine Palmon and she understands my health problems. Along with the teachers, they get together and give me extra attention. I miss a lot of school due to my asthma attacks and recurrent lower respiratory tract infections (I’ve had 10 episodes of pneumonia in the last five years), so the teachers take photos of the notes I miss and send them over to my mother, who helps me with my schoolwork. The Primary Branch teachers have been educated on my health problems and they know what exactly to do in case of an emergency. 

 I also wear a special badge to school. It has my Ammi’s mobile number along with information about my medicines which I carry in my schoolbag. This is important because sometimes I may not be able to tell someone when I’m having an attack, but my badge has all the information they would need. 

 Are you currently working on any projects? 

 Right now, I am focussing on the #JedFightsAsthma campaign as I really want to raise awareness amongst the general public about respiratory diseases. 

 But, I did a shoot for a TV commercial for a bank last week and a few other commercials in the last couple of months too. 

 My main focus as of now is to get #JedFightsAsthma to the leaders of my country and influencers who will listen to my little (squeaky) voice and help make a change in the lives of children with respiratory diseases. 

 Do you have any tips for kids who are living with respiratory problems on staying safe and maintaining their health? 

 Children with respiratory diseases are just like other kids. Yes, we are a bit different as a lot of activities and foods are limited to us. 

 My main advice is to stay active. Running, riding a bicycle, swimming, yoga, and gymnastics are fantastic activities which help our lungs expand. Also, food intake is vital. Healthy foods such as vegetables, and proteins such as chicken, fish, and eggs are great. Ice creams and cold food and drinks are something we asthmatics cannot have, but an occasional, once-in-a-blue-moon sip of chocolate milkshake will do no harm. After all, we make memories, and the best memories for kids have chocolate in them! 

 What are your future goals? 

 I want to be a doctor. I have always wanted to be a doctor to help little children like myself. I want to pursue a career in acting as well. I think I can do both. 

 But for now, I want to be healthy and help other kids fight this battle with me. 

 Do you have any final message for our readers? 

 We only live once, so make the most of it – this is something my Ammi always tells me. So, she lets me play with dirt, encourages me to do activities that all other children do, and always makes sure I live a normal life as much as possible. 

 This is for both me and my sister. 

 My sister and I learn so much through play, and that is what children should be doing. Learning through play! 

 Respiratory diseases are on the rise with the rise in pollution in the environment, so my advice to everyone is to stay safe, and prevention is always better than cure. ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Jed fights asthma,tabloids,0,1602961849,0,101296,,
,,Re-emergence of Covid-19 | Don't panic! We’re in control: Lt. Gen. Shavendra Silva,interviews,"Sri Lanka faces its most aggressive wave of Covid-19 infections at present, and while the entire mechanism is yet again set in motion to flatten the curve,  The Sunday Morning  spoke with the Chief of Defence Staff, Commander of the Army, and the Head of the National Operation Centre for Prevention of Covid-19 Outbreak (NOCPCO) Lt. Gen. Shavendra Silva on how the entire operation is set in motion and the challenges the Sri Lanka Army and other stakeholders face head on to ensure the wellbeing of the population.

  Excerpts of the interview:  

 Following the COVID Lockdown Earlier this year, Authorities were closely monitoring the situation. How did the virus return to society? 

From the beginning back in March, the authorities have been closely monitoring the situation irrespective of whether the threat had reduced or not; monitoring will continue until such time the entire world is safe from the virus. Even though we had controlled Covid-19 in Sri Lanka, the virus still prevails in the world and the threat has not been evaded. Therefore, we have to understand that until such time a vaccination is invented, a medicine is found, or the people become naturally immune to this virus, the danger will not go away.

However, we cannot keep all the borders closed forever. Repatriation is a must for a country like Sri Lanka and we are obliged to bring back our own people who have gone out of the country to earn money for their families in order to have a better life. Also, there was massive pressure from their families, society, and other parties to bring them back soon. The Government took action, while answering to such grievances, to adopt a strategy to prevent and minimise the risk of the virus being transmitted to society from the repatriates.

Two organisations were involved in this process. First, the military; the military conducted the initial 14-day strict quarantine process – there is no opportunity to skip or evade the quarantine process at any cost. The second party is the healthcare authorities under whose supervision the next 14-day mandatory home quarantine was conducted. This period was not like in the quarantine centres; they were on their own but under the supervision of the health authorities. We sincerely believe and trust that people who underwent the home quarantine process were disciplined and adhered to the stipulated rules with integrity. However, we cannot rule out the fact that there is an opportunity for one or two persons to take a risk and go out.

 Did the authorities let their guard down since cases were not reported from society even after the August General elections? 

Under the great leadership of His Excellency the President, we have a very responsible and dedicated authority in this country that never lowered their guard – they are examples to the authorities of other countries. Without their commitment, the country would have been in a situation similar to most of the countries in the region. The relentless dedication of the authorities brought our country to normalcy within 50 days, whereas the huge economies and developed countries still struggle. However, the general public is also responsible; it is not possible to go behind every citizen in the country and police them.

 Were there lapses in the repatriation of Sri Lankans and the follow up of individuals after they completed quarantine? 

Again, this has links to the point that I stressed upon previously. As the Head of the National Operation Centre for Prevention of Covid-19 Outbreak, Chief of Defence Staff, and Commander of the Army, I responsibly say that there was no lapse in the system and we adhered to all the guidelines stipulated by the health authorities and the WHO (World Health Organisation).

 Were there instances when certain individuals after returning to the country did not follow the mandatory quarantine period? 

I would say no persons who returned or arrived in Sri Lanka evaded the private (paid) or government (free) quarantine process both run by the tri-forces, with the only exception for diplomatic staff of the foreign embassies – the agreement between the governments was to quarantine them under the respective embassies.

 With regard to the latest spread of the virus, the PHIs (public health inspectors) have alleged that they were not informed of the repatriations carried out by Brandix. What is your view? 

It is an allegation with no credibility. There was no separation of Brandix staff or any other staff; everyone who came to Sri Lanka were directed to the quarantine process regardless of the status.

If I give the statistics, 168 personnel came on 25 July and underwent the mandatory quarantine process; 82 at The Blue Water Hotel and 86 at Sheraton Hotel. 125 personnel came on 8 August, and underwent the mandatory quarantine process at Koggala Resort. Forty-eight personnel came on 22 September and underwent the mandatory quarantine process at the Sheraton Hotel. The first patient was found on 3 October and the symptoms of other staff were reported to have started on 28 September. We assume the virus had started spreading approximately from 10 to 20 September. At this time, the people who came from Chennai were still in the quarantine centre.

 Covid-19 cases are now being reported from all parts of the country including Colombo. How will the task force, headed by you, address this issue? 

We have had deliberate discussions at the NOCPCO regarding this. Our biggest concern is to revert the country back to normalcy without going for a lockdown as earlier. It is very easy to declare a complete lockdown and control the situation and it is very easy for contact tracing as well, and the public sentiment is also towards the lockdown. However, we have suffered enough as a result of complete lockdown.

At this juncture, I can give the assurance that there is no need to panic. We still have control over the situation, and “nothing is impossible”. Therefore, we request the people to trust in the mechanism and stick to being personally responsible and adhere to the instructions given by the Government.

 Will there be a partial lockdown if the cases continue to increase? 

We have better experience on the consequences of the spread and subsequent restrictions. Daily discussions take place and we assess the threat carefully based on real-time data and impose restrictions if the situation deems such action necessary. However, everything depends on how responsibly the people of this country behave in the next few days. If need be, the restrictions will be carefully imposed so that it minimises the day-to-day life of the people. We will be careful to select the affected area and restrict the minimum possible area, if we happen to opt for imposing quarantine curfew.

We request the great people of this country to report to hospital, get a medical opinion, or direct people for testing if you have the slightest doubt that you have been infected or made contact with an infected person.

 If measures are not taken to control the movement of the public, does the country have the necessary medical infrastructure to care for the increasing number of Covid-19-positive people? 

There will definitely be measures to control the movement of the public, and it is the responsibility of the public to self-control their own movement.

We are very optimistic of the capacity we have. Also, the number of ICU (Intensive Care Unit) beds are sufficient to care for extreme cases. Also, reports on the last few months say that the need for ICU beds is minimal. We have the capability to convert the existing hospitals to Covid-19 treatment hospitals. Also, we have earmarked an adequate number of hospitals for this purpose.

 How will the task force draw a balance between controlling the spread of the virus and economic activity? 

The NOCPCO; under the guidance of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, Secretary of Defence Major General Kamal Gunaratne, the Government, and all stakeholders are relentlessly working to keep the country open and the economy running.

Our efforts are towards identifying the infected personnel as soon as possible and separating them from the rest so that others can be protected. Real-time information on the affected, exposed, or any other suspicious contact is essential for this endeavour. Therefore, the co-operation of the people is highly expected in this juncture.

It is with this intention that we did not close down entire Free Trade Zones (FTZs) and all the other factories in the country. I brought down the factory owners under the BOI (Board of Investment) and other stakeholders and insisted that factories continue to run, provided that the employees of different factories do not mingle outside, in boarding houses, at public places, etc. I directed them to arrange their own accommodation and transport without allowing the employees of different factories to mix. I even offered to arrange temporary accommodation facilities if they needed it, until the situation returns to normal.

 What measures or adjustments have you made at quarantine centres that are operating under your purview? 

We have never reduced the standards of the quarantine process. We are ready to undertake any amount (of people) for quarantine with the necessary precautionary measures.

As adjustments, we have increased the number of quarantine centres, increased the frequency of disinfection, and changed the staff in a timely manner. In addition, we have one-third of our staff on reserve so that we can continue with the proper quarantine process unhindered at any eventuality.

 How many quarantine centres have been put up and what is the total number of persons that can be accommodated in these centres? 

As at 16 October, we have 84 government quarantine centres designated to provide a free-of-charge quarantine process and many adequate private quarantine centres designated for those who are willing to quarantine at private places at their expense. Both types are operated under the tri-forces under my purview. We can quarantine more than 10,000 people at a given time.

However, we have the capacity to increase the quarantine facilities substantially should there be any need for that. We have earmarked many possible locations for this purpose.

 How many hospitals and ICU beds do we have at present to treat Covid-19 patients? 

We have 14 designated hospitals for treating Covid-19 patients. Rather than playing with numbers, I guarantee the available capacity is enough to cater to the demand. We have the capacity to increase the number of hospitals and capacity to treat the patients. By now, we have enough ICU beds designated for extreme cases of Covid-19.

However, one should not be dismayed by the numbers. First, out of all the Covid-19 patients in Sri Lanka, very few required ICU facilities; second, we can convert the ICU facilities designated for other treatments to treat Covid-19 cases should there be any need.

I should especially mention that the NOCPCO is not an isolated body. We conduct deliberate discussions considering real-time data with the President, Prime Minister, Health Minister, Secretary of Defence, health authorities, and tri-forces, together with all other the stakeholders, continuously assessing the future possibilities.

 There are questions over the level of skill and knowhow of the Sri Lanka Army Medical Corps. Could you tell us a bit about how the unit put their professional skills to use when managing civilians who are referred to follow the quarantine process? 

I vehemently and responsibly deny this wrong perception. The doctors in the Army Medical Corps are equally qualified, equally trained, and equally experienced as civil doctors and so are the other medical staff. They have been endowed with the necessary knowledge through continued career progression and training.

Military medicine has been designed and developed with the experience of world wars, where the wars, pandemics, and disasters are not new to the curriculum of training. For your information, we have a separate directorate for pandemic situations which was established decades ago. The necessary training for such endeavours had already been given to them before the pandemic struck the country.

 Last month, the Sri Lanka Army Hospital established a dedicated laboratory facility. Is it only accessible to Army families? 

We are a self-sufficient force; we have qualified doctors and healthcare staff. Having all these capabilities, we do not need to add a burden to the Government in terms of seeking treatment for the members of the Army and their families at facilities which are meant for the general public. That is why we have declared our own lab facilities. However, should there be any need, we will not hesitate to open it to the public. Moreover, we have designed a Hospital in Kandy, which will be dedicated to the civilians should the need arise.

 Have you been able to utilise the new innovations that were much talked about in the first few months of the Covid-19 outbreak? 

That is a narrow quantisation, as it implies that in the beginning, we worked hard and now we don’t. I should remind you that we brought this country to complete normalcy once, and we will continue to do so. Our effort for innovation has been there from the beginning up to now.

The Army alone has made many new innovations which are being widely used in the government and private sectors. If I was to name a few main innovations – UV-C disinfection products, indoor air disinfection unit, two types of alternative respiratory machines for ventilation, sodium hypochlorite solution generator, disinfection heat chamber, safe incubation box, pro gap indicator, indoor disinfection robot and outdoor disinfection robot, automatic sanitising chambers, UV-C portable germicidal contrivance for document disinfection, automatic hand cleaners, automatic shoe cleaner, automatic vehicle disinfection chambers, cooling jackets, mobile hand disinfectant units, touch-free handwash systems, etc.

Also, the other sister services too have made many innovations which are widely used as you must have seen by now.

 Do you have a line of communication open with the rest of the world to keep up to date on the constantly evolving nature of the virus? How do you translate these findings to match the Sri Lankan situation? 

Yes, we have a very reliable system to get the real-time information, and we are linked with many of the countries. We do compare the developing situations in other countries with our situation. However, giving enough consideration to the growth of the virus in other countries, including the countries from which we bring down our own citizens, there is no evidence that the present situation is an overflow effect of the development of the virus elsewhere, despite possibilities.

We can’t deny the fact that the spread of the virus around the world has its effects on Sri Lanka, since we cannot have the entry and exit points closed forever and have to interact with the other countries as a nation. However, we have been careful not to import the virus to the general public.

 How confident are you of successfully combating the latest spread of the virus? 

I am fully sanguine of our capability, for firstly, we have a great leadership who clearly understands what is bad and what is good for the country; secondly, we have a robust healthcare system which we can rely on; thirdly, we have dedicated authorities and staff that can ardently undertake any challenge; fourthly, we have a disciplined set of citizens who actually need the betterment of the country; and finally, we are an enthusiastic, devoted, and daring force that passionately believes “nothing is impossible”.
  Additional questions*  
 How do you coordinate with various stakeholders to continue this operation to prevent the spread of COVID 19 in Sri Lanka? 

Working with civil stakeholders was newer a new task to us. As the defenders of this nation and its people at every difficult time we have collaborated with civil authorities, civil administration and even private stakeholders.

After foreseeing the national requirement, the NOCPCO was established in March to ensure coordination, collaboration and recalibration of roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders entrusting me to spearhead the venture.

Accordingly, The NOCPCO roofed all the stake holders including Tri Forces, Health Authorities, Police, and all other responsible agents including economic and social care authorities in a one platform. This enabled the necessary decision be drawn, argued, scrutinized and agreed upon with all stakeholders in one place. In that we clearly identified each other’s task, responsibility, the mutual support required, the timelines for the tasks to be completed etc.

Everyone worked as a one entity with one aim and the military contributed in all occasions stepped in when and required. This was well consolidated by the support and tolerance of the great people of this country.

 What are the challenges that your team, faced at the beginning of the process? Has there been an improvement in the situation? 

We embarked in to the battle against the Covid-19 at a situation the virus was novel, the entire world was at stand still and no country had found a concrete solution for the pandemic. Therefore, we had to go for our own strategy and focussed on containment of affected Cases, prevention of further spreading and minimizing the loss of lives.  Even though we dint have problems with stakeholders, when operationalizing the strategy, few practical problems were encountered.

The primary challenge was tracing the contacts; the most important aspect of this entire strategy is the contact tracing, because, based on the contact tracing only, the containment, and prevention of further spreading can be effectively achieved.  The military intelligence with the State Intelligence Service ardently shouldered this dauntless task. This affected immensely to contain the virus within 50 days at the initial breakout.

The secondary challenge was the isolation of affected personnel to contain the virus was not equally easy in every part of the county. Because, the spatial distribution of the population in some areas in the country, was too congested, so that home-based quarantine was not possible, for which we introduced the novel and unique ‘root ball’ system; may be for the first time in the world. In that, the personnel of close contacts were pull-out as a whole group from congested street, lane or housing complex, and transferred to quarantine centres.

Despite the strategies were made to keep people at home, there was a dire need for people to go out, reasons being the food, medicine etc. For this, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa established Special Presidential Taskforce on Essential Services that direct, coordinate and monitor the delivery of continuous services of food, medicine, banking and other amenities for the sustainment of community life.

There was a need to convey the real proliferation pattern of the virus, necessity of best health practices, personal responsibility, need for law enforcing to the people where the details of the situation were not clear and had been heavily distorted by false information’s through internet etc. In this regard Informing the public of the government strategy, and indoctrinating the necessity of compliance with the instruction issued by authorities was a must need.  We must be thankful for the National and private media for conveying the correct and extract information to and from the public.

As per my personal challenges, I have been entrusted to spearhead the National Operation Centre for Prevention of COVID 19, in addition to the Role of Chief of Defence Staff and Commander of the Army which is a huge responsibility. Therefore, I have responsibilities in three folds. I must mention the immense support and encouragement extended by my beloved wife and children in this gigantic task.

Compared to the situation at the beginning, there has been a lot of improvement, better than earlier, our soldiers understand how the spread could happen, what percussions to be taken and how to react etc. Also, the general public of the country know better about the virus than earlier. Our systems and mechanisms are better experiences by now, therefore we are optimistic that the situation can be controlled.

 At the onset of the pandemic your teams worked around the clock to prepare/ convert/ reconstruct various facilities in to temporary hospitals and quarantine centres to accommodate the growing need for such spaces. Is this operation still going on? 

We are still ready to work around the clock for the country and the people. We can meet the growing need of hospitals, or quarantine facilities. You might remember, the soldiers gave even their sleeping mattresses for the quarantine facilities at the beginning. We have been continuously working to uplift the healthcare facilities, for mitigating the COVID 19, even today we are working for it. We will be fulfilling the needs of the people even at the expense of our well-being and I guarantee that to the people of this country.

 How have you ensured the safety of your staff that is involved in this operation and the safety of the other stakeholders that you have to work alongside with? 

We have our own rules and it is not difficult to impose and carryout healthcare rules in the Army.  Our duty as responsible citizens are to act selflessly to carry out our duty and ensure safety of the civilians.

This is common to any other force as well. That is why the Navy cluster also could be controlled without affecting to civilians. We have stuck to the basic health guidelines. We have a systematic, leave, after leave, employment, deployment, and routine conduct systems. Moreover, our competent healthcare staff issue necessary guidelines frequently and the information flow within our members is very sound. Therefore, we can ensure that we will not be a carrier of the virus to any other counterpart.

,,Rewind to Sri Lanka’s first-ever ODI victory,news,"On Saturday, 13 February, 1982 at SSC, Sri Lanka played their first official One Day International (ODI). That was against England under Keith Fletcher. Sri Lanka was captained by Bandula Warnapura. England played two ODIs in that series, over a weekend, with the second match being held also at SSC on Sunday, 14 February, 1982. After losing the first by just five runs, Sri Lanka fought back to record a famous victory, their first official ODI win, the next day by three runs in the final over of the game.  The Englishmen were here for Sri Lanka’s inaugural Test match, played from 17-21 February, 1982 at P. Sara Oval. After a long battle, the International Cricket Council (ICC) bestowed Sri Lanka Test status in 1981.  Before first ODI  Coming into the first official ODI, Sri Lanka had played six “unofficial” ones, all of them being at the ICC World Cup. They played three matches in the first-ever World Cup in 1975 in England, and three again in the 1979 edition of the World Cup, also held in England.   Results of first-six unofficial ODIs:   ·       7 June 1975: Loss to West Indies by 9 wkts. at Manchester ·       11 June 1975: Loss to Australia by 52 runs at The Oval ·       14 June 1975: Loss to Pakistan by 192 runs at Nottingham ·       9 June 1979: Loss to New Zealand by 9 wkts. at Nottingham ·       13 & 15 June 1979: No result against West Indies at The Oval ·       16 & 18 June 1979: Beat India by 47 runs at Manchester  1979 inaugural ICC Trophy  Sri Lanka played the inaugural ICC Trophy for the non-Test playing (ICC Associate Members) from 22 May to 21 June 1979 in England.  Reaching the finals of the 15-team event, Sri Lanka beat Canada by 60 runs on 21 June in Worcester, to raise their stakes for ICC Full Membership which they received in two years from then. Interestingly the ICC Trophy was held simultaneously with the 1979 World Cup. The World Cup began on 9 June, with the two semi-finals held on 20 June.  The ICC Trophy final was held on 21 June and the World Cup final was held on 23 June; where West beat England for their second title at Lord’s.

,,Caring for your mental health during the second wave of Covid-19,tabloids," 

 By Sakuni Weerasinghe 

 Gone were the masks. The bottle of sanitiser, which had been a staple in our purse over the past few months, had been relegated to the dusty corner of our dressers. Entering supermarkets after just sprinkling some water on our hands had replaced previous meticulous hand-washing habits. No. I’m not pointing my finger at only you. All of us, myself included, had forgotten that it was just a couple of months ago that we endured the effects of a little something termed the Covid-19 virus. Today, we’re seemingly back to square one with the virus re-emerging to disrupt our daily lives. 

 We were slowly re-adjusting, moving on from the whiplash of the uncertainty, hopelessness, loneliness, disappointment, and other side effects of the first wave. In having gone through that experience, most of us are presumed to have an idea on what to expect with the second wave. However, this is no indication of how well we recall    the ways    stress seeped into our lives and the coping strategies we had to adopt back then as a response to mitigate it. If we are not aware of how we may be impacted, we would not be able to use our resources to upkeep our mental health the second time around.  

 Let’s take a look at a few stressors we may experience this time.  

 We were placed under curfew and had social distancing regulations in place even back then. So how is the experience any different now? For starters, we were just readjusting to our regular social lives, pre Covid-19. We were back to hanging out with our friends over brunch on Sundays, hosting dinners for family and relatives, and going out on mini-trips with cousins rejoicing in what we missed out on for months. Having just had a taste of social life, we are having to impose restrictions on ourselves again. It’s a tough adjustment.  

 Tuning into the daily news, you may find that the worries for the health, safety, and security of yourself, friends, and family are back too. Anytime a new contact is identified at a particular place on a given day, you may find yourself ruminating on your whereabouts and those of your friends. You may be irrationally pondering whether you may have passed on the virus to someone despite lack of evidence. As such, you may notice an upward spike in your health-related anxiety.  

 You may have just restarted going back to the office, and now you’re back to working from home (WFH) which can feel like you’re back to square one. You may wonder about the progress in your career, your job security, find yourself fretting over your finances once again, or find yourself entertaining thoughts of quitting altogether because the demands placed during the first WFH stage were too much that you don’t know how well you could cope with another.  

 Following the first wave, you may have just readjusted your life goals and timelines for personal events, such as starting a new degree, moving your house, or planning an engagement. Now that you’re going through this once more, you may have to edit these goals and timelines again, which can place undue stress on your shoulders.  

 As you can tell, just because you’ve been through this once doesn’t exactly mean it’s going to be a piece of cake the second time around. So what are the signs that tell you that you need additional self-care this time? 
 
           Not being able to sleep or sleeping throughout the day at home, but still not feeling rested  
           Lack of appetite or engaging in excessive eating (stress-eating). You may notice fluctuations in weight  
           Reduced physical activity and lacking the energy to engage in workouts   
           Experiencing sadness, loneliness, tiredness, anxiety, and feeling like you’re on an emotional rollercoaster  
           Constant ruminations of your health and the health of your family and friends  
           Trouble taking care of yourself including engaging in safe hygiene practices, and managing basic household chores  
 
 The good news is that strong mental health habits and self-care practices, although once forgotten, can always be re-learnt. Therefore, in caring for your mental health right now, you ought to relearn the following. 

            Address basic health needs: Nutrition, sleep, and physical activity  

 It is vital that you strive to eat healthy, in appropriate portions as per your body type and health conditions, incorporating more fruits and vegetables while minimising overly processed food. Rest is vital to your health. Adopting good sleep hygiene practices such as having a wash before bed, dimming the lights in your room, and reducing TV consumption and the usage of your mobile phones at least an hour before bed are important. Getting physically active is primary to good mental health, owing to the mind-body connection. Not only does it improve physical immunity, but it also helps upkeep mental resilience as well.  

            Stay connected with family, friends, and community  

 Our social connections are vital to our health. They are our support systems and as such, it is necessary that we remain in touch (from afar). Thanks to the easy access to mobile phones and social media, we are able to stay connected despite physical distancing. As much as we are supported by friends and family, we also have to remind ourselves to be a source of support for them as we are all going through some form of the effects of the pandemic. Some struggles may be invisible. Hence, it is vital that we take time to inquire about their health and well-being, such as by asking “how are you feeling today?”, “have you had your meals and had a restful sleep?”, or “how do you feel about working from home?”. We are all part of multiple communities; therefore, it is necessary that we extend our check-ins to those in those respective communities as well. Check in on your neighbours, college peers, and your friends from Sunday school.  

            Remain hopeful  
As Admiral William H. McRaven notes in his book    Make Your Bed   : “Hope is the most powerful force in the universe…(shows) that in the very worst of times we could rise above the pain, the disappointment, and the agony and be strong. That we each had within us the ability to carry on and not only to survive but also to inspire others.”  

 Irrespective of the context, hope gives us something to look forward to, even in turbulent times. We can still look at things we can be grateful for. Remind yourself that the pandemic would not last forever, and that life remains yet to be experienced. This also allows you to refocus on what you can control when everything seems beyond it. We cannot undermine the effects we have on others by being hopeful. Action out of hope has the potential to shape and inspire. In practising safe hygiene habits such as wearing a mask the right way, practising appropriate hand washing; fostering new connections and putting time and effort into existing relationships; and revising your routines to accommodate a work-life balance, you’re engendering hope within yourself as well as in others. Hope is displayed through these seemingly “little” gestures and in the way you communicate. In the very least, it gives another person a chance to consider the big picture.

,,Aadhya Wijegoonawardena : The lady behind Brown Paint,tabloids," By Mahika Panditha 

 Happy Sunday and welcome back everyone! We hope you are all having a lovely weekend. I would like to take this moment to introduce you to our amazing cover feature today – a young Sri Lankan woman residing in Australia at the moment. You may have seen her on Instagram either for her dancing or through Brown Paint, of which she is the Founder. 

 Aadhya Wijegoonawardena is a woman of many talents! She has just finished filming an Australian television series that is being produced by both Netflix and ABC, and it is so exciting – we cannot wait to see her on the big screen! At the moment, however, she is working on a musical. She is also a semi-finalist in the Artists of Colour Initiative, which is for emerging musical theatre artistes in Australia. 

 “Work has been limited, given the almost year-long quarantine in Melbourne due to Covid-19, but I have been blessed to have landed some this year, despite everything, and for that I am so grateful. In the meantime, I have been studying in an acting course to deepen my craft and have been working on writing my own stage show which is yet to be announced,” she told    Happinez   . 

 I was curious to know what Aadhya would describe her passions and goals as. In this regard she said: “My passion is creating thought-provoking art that communicates something important and spreads the infectious joy of dancing. I hope that one day my art truly inspires social change. I love people and I believe the best in people. I believe that encouraging more people to simply follow their passions will create a more passionate world and will in turn cure the world. I hope to do this through Brown Paint. 

 “I would love to further my career in the arts, particularly act more on TV and move on to doing films. I would love to also make music and tour one day, singing and dancing around the world perhaps. I hope that Brown Paint takes off and brings to light these issues within South Asian culture. Most of all, I wish to be a role model for young South Asian people that have a dream and to empower them to follow their calling.” 

 We are beyond excited to see what Aadhya has in store, but in the meantime, we had the chance to talk to her a little more. Check it out! 

 Tell us a little bit about yourself before we dive in. 

 I am a 21-year-old Melbourne-based dancer, singer, and actress working in the film, television, and music theatre industries. I am also the Founder of Brown Paint, a platform that aims to inspire intra-cultural social change and break barriers within the South Asian community by celebrating Brown artistes, creatives, and renegades. 

 What inspired you to get into dance and how did it all start? 

 My late mother inspired me to dance. She was a traditional Kandyan dancer and so I feel this gift was passed down to me. Dance was the biggest gift my mother gave me. Even though she is gone, I feel that dance still connects us in a way that words cannot explain. From the minute I could walk, I was dancing and when I turned three, my mother enrolled me in a local ballet, jazz, and tap class. I grew up dancing at a classical ballet school, exploring all styles, from contemporary to jazz to lyrical as well. My ballet school didn’t offer street styles so I began training at an adult hip hop class in the city and immediately fell in love with the hip hop scene and its culture. My biggest strengths became ballet and it’s polar opposite, hip hop. At the age of 16, I decided to start exploring my art professionally and signed with my first agent. 

 What is your favourite dance style and why? 

 I tend not to think of dance in styles anymore. After years of dancing, it transforms into more of an amalgamation of movement, which is far more enjoyable than being constrained by a specific style or genre. However, if I had to pick, I would say I enjoy a fusion of hip hop and contemporary, similar to one of my idols, the incredible Lex Ishimoto. I love moving in freedom and dynamics, creating interesting shapes, and pushing my body’s limits. The body is different every day and craves different movements. Movement is truly medicine and if you really listen to what your body needs, you can very literally dance your way out of your emotional traumas. This is why I love movement as it appears in dance styles, because it allows for the intuitive wisdom of your body to kick in. 

 Any advice for aspiring dancers? 

 Train, but don’t get lost in the training of it all. Always come back to why you started dancing in the first place, your love for it, and don’t forget to dance with joy first and technique second. Maintain a healthy relationship with your body and its movement. As dancers, our bodies are our instruments, so it is so important to stay in tune with it. When making dance into a career, it’s vital that you remember to dance for fun. Have an occasional boogie in your room and don’t worry about what you look like; simply enjoy it as a felt experience. This is great advice for everyone, not just dancers. Dance is medicine and can be highly therapeutic, so surrender, let the music possess you, and just let go. 

 You are also the Founder of Brown Paint on Instagram. What is the story behind that? 

 Brown Paint was born out of my frustration towards my South Asian culture. Growing up, I always felt like the black sheep of the family. I felt that no one accepted those of us that were against the grain: Brown artistes, creatives, rebels, renegades, entrepreneurs, etc. I realised that because the culture rejected me, I rejected the culture, and grew so far away from my sense of true self and ancestry. 

 Brown Paint was my solution to rebuilding a relationship with my culture, celebrating the beautiful parts, and finally holding the destructive parts accountable. We celebrate Brown creatives and renegades because we believe they will be the ones to inspire this much-needed social change within the culture, through their rebellion, expression, and creative vision. Some of the issues within the culture we address are: Tiger parenting, misogyny, colonialism, beauty standards, representation, mental health, sexual stigmas, and double standards towards women. Brown Paint will soon be launching on YouTube, Facebook, and as a podcast on every platform, including Spotify, Google Play, and Apple Podcasts. So stay tuned. 

 A new series called ‘Drop Out and Dream’ is also out. What does this series focus on and what do you hope to achieve with it? 

 As a young South Asian with big dreams, I struggled to embrace my identity as an artiste and dancer and being accepted within the culture. There are unfortunately so many old stigmas that our culture clings on to that will present a great challenge for most young aspiring Brown artistes, and may even discourage a person completely from pursuing their dreams, whatever they may be. This is what I believe is one of the biggest tragedies within the South Asian community; young people giving up on their dreams out of pressure from their community, culture, and family. This is an issue Brown Paint hopes to eradicate. 

 The overarching message of this series is to never stop dreaming. By this I mean do not put a time limit on your dreams and do not fall into the trap of compromising on your path of happiness out of a need for “security”, especially if that advice is given by someone other than yourself. I truly believe that every single human is worthy of and is more than capable of creating any life they wish to live. Doing anything other than believing in oneself will only eat at one’s self esteem. 

 Allow your dreams to be as they are, no matter how big or unrealistic they may seem, because you can actually do it, and because you deserve everything you wish to have from this life. That is what the “Drop Out and Dream” series focuses on, as well as how to stop letting others influence your pivotal life decisions, going into depth in abolishing the myth of the “struggling artiste”, and offering practical advice, like on how to provide for oneself as an artiste and how to have a conversation with your family about pursuing an alternative or controversial career path. 

 What motivates your ideas for content, whether it be informative texts or videos? 

 My own personal experience and trauma with my culture inspires the Brown Paint content, as well as other people’s personal stories. Many of us have been discriminated against by our own culture for simply expressing or being ourselves, and sharing these messages through Brown Paint has proven to be incredibly healing for myself and many others. For example, coming into myself as a young woman and artiste caused tremendous grief for my Brown family, especially those still living back in Sri Lanka. Since then, I have been able to heal my relationships, especially the one with my dad, which has given me invaluable insight for Brown Paint. Our newest series that is coming out soon is a series about Brown parents and how to heal relationships specifically catered towards our culture and it’s unique quirks. 

 Where do you hope Brown Paint will be in the next five years? 

 I hope that in five years Brown Paint will have grown a significant online presence and also furthered its physical presence. I dream to have Brown Paint events and workshops one day, where we bring real parents and children in and get hands-on with healing relationships. I would love to launch a clothing line to empower young South Asian kids living within a diaspora to embrace their cross-cultural identity through eastern and western fusion clothing. I hope to actually go back to my motherland Sri Lanka and other South Asian nations to introduce programmes into their school systems and influence politics. More than anything, I wish that Brown Paint genuinely shifts the mentalities of this current generation, so that one day, our children can live in a loving and healthy culture and be proud of their beautiful brown skin.

,,Procrastination: Why do we do it?,tabloids," By Patrick de Kretser 

 The relevance of this article really depends on what end of the spectrum you reside on; whether you are someone who works so often that you consider yourself a “workaholic” or whether you cannot get anything done until the last minute no matter what you do. Maybe you identify as someone in between. Perhaps you find that you’re an active person who only occasionally slacks off or maybe you see yourself as a lazy person who has bursts of productivity from time to time. Either way, procrastination is an issue that most of us face on occasion. And it could be for absolutely anything, mind you. It could be you putting off that important assignment for work or school until the final day or it could be something as simple as you delaying the cleaning up tasks you have at home. As teenagers and young adults, we can find ourselves really struggling with the consequences of procrastination on occasion. Things like paranoia, anxiety, depression, and anger can all occur as a result of procrastinating things that we need to do. So why do we do it if that is the case? Is it because we are simply lazy or is it more complicated than that? 

 Well, the first thing that we need to understand is that procrastination is not always a result of laziness. And this is a misconception that many people have when they think about the topic. It can be easy to equate procrastination to a lack of care or passion to do a particular task, but it is often not the case. We do not always put tasks off because we do not care about them, but rather because sometimes we have no choice or guidance on how to get around doing them. One example is because a person might be suffering from issues such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). 

  ADHD affects millions of people worldwide and is a main reason why many adolescents and young adults struggle with doing tasks. It is estimated to affect 2.2% of all youth individuals worldwide under the age of 18.

 Maybe you do not realise it just yet, but you yourself could be suffering from acute symptoms of ADHD if you have not been properly diagnosed for it before. It can sometimes be hard for families and friends to see the signs of ADHD in an individual, hence many children grow up feeling a sense of confusion or frustration as to why they find learning so difficult. For those that go through ADHD, learning becomes a bit harder and the difficulties with focusing on tasks arise far more consistently than with someone who does not have ADHD. The problems associated with it could even be so severe that no conventional tactics will ever get you to do productive work; you could be locked in a room with no phone or distractions other than the textbook in front of you and you still would find it incredibly challenging to get through it. What we need to understand is that these problems are normal to face; it does not make us lazy nor does it mean we lack ambition. It simply means that we require a bit of extra guidance and support which will get us back on track. 

 Even if ADHD is not the problem you face and if procrastination is an occasional thorn that you still wish you could cut down on, you might find a solution in planning how you go about your tasks a bit differently.  

 Here are three easy methods that might work as a quick remedy for you to cut down on procrastination. 

 
 
 	  Spread your tasks and deadlines out  
 
 

 You might be facing an issue with overly congesting your timetable to do too many things in a short period of time. For some people, this tends to be a desirable tactic because they get bursts of energy on occasion and want to do everything at once if they can. But the problem with this is that it amplifies those feelings of anxiety, depression, and frustration that you might be feeling as well. Spreading your work out is important to cut down on those mental problems you might be tackling and it genuinely helps your overall productivity if you try to commit this idea to memory. 

 
 
 	  Be supportive of those around you and encourage them to do the same for you  
 
 

 This is something I found very useful to deal with procrastination myself. Some of us just are not designed to be isolated learners, we benefit the most from interactive learning and connecting with other people to encourage us to push forward. And sometimes people need a bit of support to make them feel better about themselves and the struggles they are going through. Be understanding of those that might be struggling with procrastination, because it is not an easy obstacle for all of us to face. 

 
 
 	  Keep clear instructions closeby so that you can refer it anytime   
 
 

 This is essentially the idea of devising a proper study plan or work plan for your timetable. Everyone learns at a different pace and we often end up being much more productive if we learn under our own system which is catered specifically to our preferences. Do not just blindly do tasks or study without any clear focus or plan. Set out a list of instructions or a guide that reminds you about the way you should approach your tasks. By doing so, you give yourself a point of reference that you can look back on for guidance if you ever feel stuck doing your work. This will massively cut down on the mental strain you will face, as you will not constantly spend week in and week out wondering how you should go about doing your tasks. 

 -- 

 Now, if nothing in this article applies to you and if you are already taking all the advice that I have presented you, perhaps you should not fix anything. There are a lot of people I know that work really hard yet constantly feel that they do not do enough or get distracted too much, yet they do not realise that they are doing everything correctly and there is nothing that they need to feel guilty about. There have been trends in society which have made us believe that we need to constantly put out 100% every day of the week if we want to be successful, which have made a lot of people resent themselves because they feel like they are not living up to the standards set out for them and are not being as productive as they can be. But sometimes, we need to just take a step back, relax, and realise that we do not always have to live life in the fast lane. As long as you are making active progress towards your goal, you must always remember to give yourself some time off and not push yourself too hard, for the sake of your own mental wellbeing. Regardless of how much you feel affected by procrastination, always remember that it is normal and that there always is a solution for it. As a community, we should aim to improve ourselves and help improve those around us by understanding and guiding them through the struggles that they go through. Hopefully, this article will bring you one step closer to finding out how to do that.

,,The long wait for justice ,news," After sputtering away for many months now, serious headway seems to have been made by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) probing the Easter Sunday attacks, going by what transpired before the commission last week.  

 As expected, former President Maithripala Sirisena was the cynosure of all eyes and the man of many surprises did not disappoint. In the process, the former President, who is well known to be a serial betrayer, added one more to the infamous list when he had no hesitation in pushing his former confidant and Head of the State Intelligence Service (SIS) right under the bus. Others who have suffered a similar fate in the recent past include the Late Ven. Sobitha Thera, former President Chandrika Kumaratunga, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, and the 6.5 million people who voted for him in 2015.  

 Although Maithripala Sirisena had insisted all along that SIS Director Nilantha Jayawardena did not communicate the foreign intelligence received on 4 April 2019 of an imminent terror attack, telecommunication data obtained by the PCoI probing the 21 April 2019 attacks had in fact revealed evidence to the contrary. In fact, call records produced at the inquiry last week show that Jayawardena had called Sirisena on multiple occasions between 4 and 16 April 2019 when the then President left for Singapore on what has so far been described as a private visit.  

 However, in his evidence last week, Maithripala Sirisena for the very first time revealed that he had been hospitalised in Singapore at the time the attacks took place. Having been the Head of State at the time, the people of the country deserved to have been informed whether this was a sudden, unplanned hospitalisation and if so, for what reason, or whether it was a pre-planned hospitalisation, in which case he had all the time in the world to make the necessary arrangements to appoint someone to act on his behalf during his absence from the country.  

 It is unfathomable that the SIS Director was unaware of his statutory obligation to brief his boss and Commander in Chief on sensitive intelligence information, given the credible foreign source, whether corroborated by local intelligence or not, during the multiple times the duo had spoken between the 4th and 16th. All evidence points to the affirmative, especially in light of the well-known fact that Jayawardena was considered to be the ex-President’s confidant and go-to man for all matters concerning the Police, even bypassing the Inspector General of Police (IGP). It was this short-circuiting of the police hierarchy by the Defence Minister and Commander in Chief that led to a breakdown of communication with the IGP who, at least in Sirisena’s eyes, was seen as being more loyal to the then Prime Minister.   

 By the looks of it, Sirisena may well have cooked his goose as a result of what he said before the commission last week. The inaccuracy of telephone records, inconsistencies with regard to what was stated before, and multiple slip-ups on his version of events during the inquiry proceedings last week, have opened up what might well be a can of worms. What stood out, however, was his revelation that he was hospitalised when the explosions took place in Sri Lanka and the fact that either by design or default, he avoided appointing an acting Defence Minister in his absence as “he could be contacted at any time using technology”.   

 The most startling revelation was when Sirisena told the commission that SIS Director Nilantha Jayawardena had contacted him and informed him about the explosions that had taken place on Sunday morning. However, phone records show the particular call was made before the explosions took place. How Jayawardena could have informed him about explosions that were yet to take place that morning is the million-dollar question, while Sirisena claimed Jayawardena told him so. When the improbability of such a call being made was pointed out to Sirisena based on call records, he pointed to the time difference between the two countries. When this was also factored in and it was established that the call came before the attacks, he said he could not recall speaking to Jayawardena that morning.  

 The contradictions are astonishing to say the least. Having gone on record that the reason he did not appoint an acting minister to oversee the defence portfolio was because he could be reached at any time, he then claimed to have been hospitalised on the 20th and 21st, and therefore, could not be contacted as even his security was not allowed to be in the vicinity. On the face of it, whichever way one looks at it, Sirisena has to be held accountable if nothing else for sheer negligence and the cavalier manner in which he handled the country’s most important job at its most critical point.   

 If Sirisena knew he was going to be hospitalised, does that not merit the appointment of an acting minister under normal circumstances? In this instance, it can be assumed based on the evidence submitted before the PCoI so far that Sirisena could not have been unaware of the intelligence reports pointing to an imminent threat. Yet it seems he took things for granted.   

 If one is to go by what the former President is now saying, then his friend, the SIS Director, needs to be held accountable for his monumental failure to apprise the Defence Minister of an imminent threat despite multiple warnings from multiple sources. It has now come to a point where it has to be one way or the other. It is up to the commission to find out who is to be believed and indeed who is to be punished.   

 If that was not bad enough, adding fuel to the fire was the revelation that it was none other than Sirisena himself who had signed the recommendation for the release of suspects held in custody over the recovery of a large haul of explosives and weapons in Wanathawilluwa just four months prior to the Easter attacks. These suspects were identified as Muslim extremists hailing from the East, connected to the destruction and vandalising of Buddhist statues in Mawanella, which resulted in a mini riot there. All four suspects had been arrested under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and two of them had been released based on Sirisena’s recommendation in less than three months – just over a month before the Easter attacks.  

 Unfortunately, for the people eagerly seeking justice for the hundreds who perished and yet more maimed for life, the drama unfolding before the commission is being drowned out by the cacophony surrounding other current issues. One can only hope that the law will take its course and those responsible for criminal negligence and breach of duty will be identified and held accountable.

,,20A: D-day Thursday,news," 
           India, China, and US pour attention on Sri Lanka   
           20A heats up, creating chaos at group meeting   
           Only changes given to SC to be amended in 20A   
           Religious leaders express concerns over 20A   
 
 Amidst the unfolding drama over the 20th Amendment Bill, Sri Lanka has managed to capture the attention of three foreign countries – China, India, and the US.  

 Following a virtual bilateral meeting between Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi a few weeks back, where discussions focused on bilateral relations and the Indian-funded projects in Sri Lanka, the attention of the Chinese also focused on the island nation.  

It is as a result of this attention and prominence placed by the Chinese on Sri Lanka in its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) that Director of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission of the Chinese Communist Party Yang Jiechi led a delegation of Chinese officials to Sri Lanka the previous week.  

 During the brief visit, Jiechi held discussions with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa on the 9th. 

 The Chinese Embassy tweeted a few days after Jiechi’s visit that “a $ 500 million concessional loan” has been requested by the Finance Ministry from a “China financial institute” and that it was under negotiation. This loan negotiation is in addition to Beijing’s $ 90 million grant to Sri Lanka, announced soon after Jiechi’s visit.  

 State Minister of Money, Capital Markets, and State Enterprise Reforms Ajith Nivard Cabraal had said the Government will use the $ 500 million loan from the China Development Bank (CDB) for budgetary support.  

 According to Cabraal, this would be in addition to the $ 500 million loan obtained earlier this year and the agreement for the fresh loan would be signed between the Finance Ministry and the CDB.  

 Soon after the Chinese delegation left the shores of Sri Lanka, news of an impending visit of a senior US state official hit the stands.  

 US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is scheduled to visit Sri Lanka on 28 October and during his visit, is expected to hold discussions with President Rajapaksa and Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena.  

 An advance team from the US is expected to arrive in the country to lay the groundwork for Pompeo’s visit. Members of the advance team will be required to undergo PCR tests.  

 Given Sri Lanka’s geographical positioning in the Indian Ocean, the focus on the island nation by the Chinese has undoubtedly got the Indians and the Americans all trying their best to push their respective interests in Sri Lanka.  

 The cold war between US and China that has seen the former blacklisting many Chinese companies engaged in projects in the South East and South Asian regions, along with travel restrictions imposed on some senior members of the Chinese Communist Party, shows the possibility of being extended to the shores of Sri Lanka. 

 However, President Rajapaksa has clearly outlined the country’s non-aligned, friendly foreign policy that gives no space for external interference and it would now be put to the test.  

Bathiudeena drama    

 Another non-20th Amendment political development that unfolded last week was the Police chase for former Minister and All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) Leader Rishad Bathiudeen.  

 The “Rishad-Police” drama started with the Attorney General (AG) directing the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to arrest Bathiudeen over the alleged misappropriation of public funds.  

 However, with the Magistrate refusing to issue an arrest warrant, saying there was no need for one, the CID deployed several teams to take Bathiudeen into custody.  

 However, even by Friday (16), the Police had failed to arrest Bathiudeen, as he could not be found.  

 Bathiudeen meanwhile filed a writ application at the Court of Appeal through his lawyers on Thursday (15), seeking a court order to prevent his arrest.  

 Then Minister of Industry and Commerce Bathiudeen, Project Director Mohamed Yaseen Samsudeen, and Project Accountant Alagarathnam Manoranjan are accused of violating Article 82(1) of the Presidential Elections Act No. 15 of 1981 by misappropriating public funds amounting to Rs. 9.5 million.  

 They had allegedly misused 222 buses belonging to the state-owned Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) to transport internally displaced persons (IDPs) from Puttalam to the Silavathurai Polling Division in Mannar during the 2019 presidential election.  

 The Fort Magistrate last week imposed a travel ban on Bathiudeen on the request of the CID.  

 The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), of which the ACMC is a coalition partner, has condemned ongoing attempts to arrest Bathiudeen, calling the move politically motivated.   

 SJB General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara, issuing a press release, stated that Bathiudeen, as the then Minister for Industry and Resettlement, had obtained written permission from the Ministry’s Project Office to obtain funding to hire buses from the SLTB to transport displaced persons from Negombo to Mannar, to exercise their vote at the last presidential election.    

 “Furthermore, the Chairman of the Election Commission, Mahinda Deshapriya had given written authorisation to the Chairman of the SLTB to make the necessary arrangements to transport the displaced persons,” Madduma Bandara had said, pointing out that the Project Management Unit of the Ministry had made the necessary payments for the service after the election was over.   

 “The Government is making baseless allegations regarding Rishad Bathiudeen and have begun a staged drama by arresting a police officer who was assigned to protect him and by taking into custody firearms which were issued by the State for his security. They are displaying these to the media and trying to mislead the public,” the SJB General Secretary had said.  

 According to Madduma Bandara, Bathiudeen was only doing what was expected of him as the Minister for Industry and Resettlement, and charged that the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) is yet to settle Rs. 145 million in dues to the SLTB for services during the said election.   

 20A heats up    

 Apart from the Bathiudeen drama, political circles are eagerly awaiting the parliamentary sessions scheduled for this week.  

 Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena is expected to read out the observations of the Supreme Court that have been sent to him regarding the 20th Amendment Bill.  

 The Bill would then have to be taken up for debate with the necessary changes to the Amendment being made at the committee stage of the parliamentary debate.  

The parliamentary party leaders on Friday (16) decided to debate the 20th Amendment in Parliament on Wednesday (21) and Thursday (22).

 However, the 20th Amendment Bill has created quite a rift within the governing party ranks. The past few weeks saw several governing party parliamentarians as well as nationalist organisations affiliated to the Government making public statements against certain clauses in the proposed piece of legislation.  

 They also expressed disappointment at the lack of a proper dialogue on the 20th Amendment.  

 It is in the backdrop that a meeting of the governing party parliamentarians was organised on 9 October evening at Temple Trees convened by Prime Minister Rajapaksa to discuss the 20th Amendment.  

 The meeting was aimed at discussing the contents of the 20th Amendment, but it ended up in pandemonium. 

 President Rajapaksa had headed the meeting and former President Maithripala Sirisena as well as Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) MPs had also attended it. 

 The meeting that had commenced around 4 p.m. had lasted for over two-and-a-half hours and concluded at 6.30 p.m.  

 Explaining difficulties    

 At the outset of the meeting, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman, Education Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris had explained the difficulties in removing certain officials like the Attorney General (AG) and the Inspector General of Police (IGP) due to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.  

 He had explained that the need for introducing the 20th Amendment while abolishing the 19th Amendment was important, as the country had been governed by former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe through various cabinet subcommittees during the previous Government under President Sirisena.  

 However, objections were raised against Prof. Peiris’ reasoning with a ruling party member noting that the removal of the AG and the IGP was not connected with the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.  

 The MP had pointed out that then Prime Minister Wickremesinghe had moved a motion in Parliament which had allowed the then Government to remove the AG and the IGP at any moment by passing a resolution in Parliament with a majority vote under Act No. 5 of 2002.      

 However, the President had intervened and objected to the statement.  

 Meanwhile, briefing them on matters relating to government auditing, Justice Minister Ali Sabry had noted that such auditing is useless.  

 Citing examples from auditing in Malaysia and India, Sabry had explained that auditing by the Government has not brought any tangible benefits to the country.  

 Chaotic meeting    

 It is learnt that the President had not agreed with the statements made by MP Gevindu Kumaratunga related to the clauses in the 20th Amendment.  

 Kumaratunga had urged the head of the meeting to permit him to express his views on the 20th Amendment, as they are the people who shaped public opinion to bring the Government into power and helped Rajapaksa assume the presidency.  

 He had complained that persons in air-conditioned rooms, who had not done anything towards bringing the “Pohottuwa” into power, were now trying to mislead the governing party.    

 The President had said: “There is nothing to discuss. I am the Executive President of this country, elected by a massive mandate of 6.9 million people to change the 19th Amendment to the Constitution and develop the country. Therefore, don’t hinder my work unnecessarily.”  

 The President, during the meeting, had clearly indicated who was calling the shots.  

 It is learnt that the President had also objected when Minister Wimal Weerawansa had inquired as to why the parliamentary group was summoned for a meeting if their suggestions were not required. 

 Prime Minister Rajapaksa had then intervened and had requested the President to allow party leaders to express their views.  

 However, the President had not agreed with the Prime Minister’s request, stating that he had received the people’s mandate to work and he could not do so with the 19th Amendment.  

 Thereafter, speaking on behalf of the SLFP, Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva had noted the need to implement the 20th Amendment.  

 Responding promptly, Minister Weerawansa had criticised de Silva before the President, saying: “This man, Nimal, is a crook and a coward.” Weerawansa had said that it was de Silva who had walked up to him in Parliament and expressed his concerns about the 20th Amendment and commended him (Weerawansa) for publicly raising objections over some of the contents in the proposed piece of legislation.  

 “Mr. President, many leaders in this country have been wronged by such rogues. Therefore, it is better for you to be careful,” Weerawansa had charged.  

 Thereafter, speaking on behalf of the President, Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi had reiterated the need of abolishing the 19th Amendment, as it was enacted in Parliament to take political revenge from opponents.  

 Minister Vasudeva Nanayakkara had expressed his concerns over the 20th Amendment despite disruptions. 

 Nanayakkara had vehemently criticised Justice Minister Sabry’s submissions on government auditing amidst obstructions by some ruling party backbenchers at the meeting.       

 He had noted that he is fully aware of the need to audit state institutions as a member of the parliamentary COPE (Committee on Public Enterprises) and had asked why there is hesitation to audit the President’s and Prime Minister’s Offices.  

 At this moment, several MPs including Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Vidura Wickramanyake, and Tiran Alles had stepped up to express their views amidst objections raised by the President.   

 The President had reiterated that the people have given him a mandate and he will act accordingly and there was no need for any more discussions about the matter. 

 The Prime Minister had then concluded the proceedings.      

 It was later learnt that several governing party backbenchers loyal to SLPP Founder and theoretician Basil Rajapaksa had met with him (Basil) several hours before the meeting at Temple Trees on the 20th Amendment.  

 While the President had objected to the concerns raised by governing party members over the 20th Amendment, the group of backbenchers who had met with Basil earlier that day had heckled and jeered at the members who had spoken at the meeting.  

 Difficult changes    

    Nevertheless, it was last week revealed that proposals made by governing party members to be included in the 20th Amendment Bill will not be included even at the committee stage of the debate in Parliament.  

 Justice Minister Sabry has explained to the Cabinet of Ministers last week that only the amendments that had been presented to the Supreme Court through the AG could be subject to changes in the proposed piece of legislation.  

 The Minister had further explained that the clauses that would require the holding of a referendum would also be subjected to changes at the committee stage in Parliament.  

 The amendments to the 20th Amendment Bill proposed by the likes of Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Wimal Weerawansa, Vasudeva Nanayakkara, and Gevindu Kumaratunge are therefore, likely to be discarded.  

 Wijeyadasa writes again    

 Following the pandemonium at the parliamentary group meeting the previous week when discussing the proposed 20th Amendment Bill, former Cabinet Minister SLPP MP Rajapakshe last week wrote a second letter to President Rajapaksa requesting to formulate a new constitution instead of introducing the 20th Amendment.  

 Rajapakshe had pointed out that in a situation where the country is facing a severe economic crisis triggered by Covid-19, it was unwise to create a constitutional crisis and fight over it.  

 In addition, vehement opposition was also expressed among society against the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution, and the people who voted for the Government and the President had also become hopeless, he had noted.  

 The law veteran had pointed out that he decided to raise his concerns over the 20th Amendment in a 10-page letter, as he and other ministers and MPs weren’t given an opportunity to express their opinions over the proposed Amendment; they were told there was no need to discuss the Amendment and that it would definitely be passed in Parliament by the President irrespective of the outcome of the meeting that was called at Temple Trees on 9 October to discuss the 20th Amendment. 

 Elaborating further, one-time Justice Minister Rajapakshe had also stated that the two points expressed by Education Minister Prof. G.L. Pieris at the beginning of the meeting were totally wrong. 

 Accordingly, the points, as explained by Rajapakshe, which were wrongly interpreted by Prof. Pieris, included the inability of the President under the 19th Amendment to remove the IGP and the AG, and to appoint a subcommittee within the Cabinet for economic activities and the holding of its chairmanship by former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.  

 The governing party MP had denied any connection between the two points raised by Prof. Pieris to the 19th Amendment.  

 Rajapakshe has reiterated the negative aspects of the 20th Amendment under 10 subtopics in the letter.  

 The 10 subtopics include: removing of several presidential powers, abolishing of the commissions needed for the country including the audit commission and procurement commission, removing the limitations introduced on the number of cabinet and state and deputy ministers, enabling the president to dissolve Parliament within a year from the inauguration, introducing provisions to present emergency acts, amending the law which disabled a dual citizen to become an MP or the president of the country, removing the Presidential Secretariat and Prime Minister’s Office from the Auditor General’s inspection, repealing the constitutional provisions which made it compulsory to audit an institution in which the State has shares of over 50%, removing the Bribery and Corruption Commission, and removing of the oath in the subsection for not dividing the country, which has already been accepted by the Justice Ministry which said it was a mistake.  

 Hitting out 

 Soon after Rajapakshe’s second letter to the President became public, several senior SLPP members decided to take a stand against Rajapakshe.  

 Convening a media conference at the SLPP head office, SLPP Maharagama Organiser Kanthi Kodikara had said that members of the SLPP had made great sacrifices and had even suffered behind bars in order to ensure the party won at the presidential and general elections.  

 Also speaking at the news conference, former Mayor of Moratuwa Saman Lal Fernando, who is also the next in line to enter Parliament from the Colombo District, had said that the SLPPers had toiled to assume power to serve the people of the country and not to send people like Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe to Parliament to criticise the Government.   

 Another candidate from the Colombo District list, Attorney-at-Law Ravindra Jayasinghe, had said it was unjustified for an individual to secure a parliamentary seat through the SLPP and to later act against the party.  

 The statements made by these senior SLPP members are a clear indication that Rajapakshe has earned the wrath of the pro-Rajapaksa SLPPers backing the 20th Amendment Bill.   

 SLFP stance    

 Meanwhile, former SLFP General Secretary and member of the Central Committee Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa noted that the implementation of the 20th Amendment would drag the country backwards.  

 Piyadasa is known to be a close confidante of SLFP Leader Sirisena and he had made these observations during a media discussion in Kandy recently.  

 Piyadasa had also noted that most of the agreements reached between the SLFP and SLPP were not honoured by the governing SLPP after the election and that some ministers were sidelining and harassing SLFPers in their electorates.  

 Speaking further, he had stated that even Party Leader Sirisena was being subjected to stepmotherly treatment with even his security contingent being reduced. He had added that some members of the Government were of the view that attempts are being made to arrest Sirisena under the Easter Sunday attacks probe. 

 According to Piyadasa, when governing as an alliance, there should be mutual respect and the lack of it has resulted in many SLFPers being disillusioned with the Government.  

 It is also learnt that after the general election, Sirisena had requested for Piyadasa to be appointed to Parliament through the SLPP National List, but SLPP seniors had ignored the request and appointed another member instead.  

 Maha Sangha to the fore    

 Amidst the continuing debate over the 20th Amendment, last week saw Buddhist, Catholic, and Christian religious leaders weighing in on the proposed piece of legislation.  

 The proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution rejects the core of democracy, which is one of the progressive elements of humanity, and hence should not be enacted, the Amarapura-Ramanna Samagri Maha Sangha Sabha stated last week.  

 Issuing a statement, they noted: “Steps must be taken to draft a new constitution that upholds democracy and rule of law.”  

  Following is the statement in full:   

 The Amarapura-Ramanna Samagri Maha Sangha Sabha made its position clear on the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution, and further confirmed that the proposed amendment is regressive and paves the way for an undeveloped tribal society, that will seriously impede progressive characteristics of human society such as freedom of thought and action, and therefore, the Sangha Sabha decided to make a strong emphasis to the Government that they should not pass the proposed 20th Amendment.  

 At present, most countries in the world have based their government systems on the democratic principle that the three branches of the state, i.e. the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary, should keep the equilibrium by means of checks and balances on each other. In 1978, introducing a new Constitution, Mr. J.R. Jayewardene undermined the system of checks and balances and concentrated unprecedented powers in the executive branch of the government. Since then, a broad discussion took place in the country, and 37 years later, in 2015, the 19th Amendment to the Constitution restored those checks and balances removed by President Jayewardene. The proposed 20th Amendment once again threatens democracy by undermining the system of checks and balances. The end of this process will mark the birth of authoritarianism, arbitrary despotism.  

 The Government, in support of the 20th Amendment, emphasises that their effort to bring in the 20th Amendment is to reverse some of the obstacles introduced by the 19th Amendment. However, here we wish to mention that justification put forth by the Government needs deeper scrutiny. The 19th Amendment clearly made some legislation that strengthens the sovereignty of the people. Some of the progressive enactments of the 19th Amendment are as follows:  

            Re-introducing the constitutional restriction for two terms for a president by Article 31 (2), which had been removed under the 18th Amendment;   
            Restricting foreign citizens from becoming Members of Parliament or President by Article 91 (c) XIII;   
            Establishment of a constitutional council to oversee appointments to important positions in public service;   
            Establishment of independent commissions by Article 41 (b) VI;   
            Subjecting the appointment of judges to superior courts by the President, to the approval of the Constitutional Council by Article 41 C.   

 The above facts very clearly show that the 19th Amendment to the Constitution is not a regressive reform as the Government claims. However, legal experts have pointed out technical shortcomings in the 19th Amendment; as such, any reform to the Constitution must attempt to redress the prevailing shortcomings and remedial action to address them. Instead, bringing in a new constitutional amendment such as the 20A, will only bring regressive reforms, add negativity and undemocratic features to the present Constitution. Following are some of the regressive elements proposed by the 20th Amendment.  

            Although the Parliament holds powers over public finance according to Article 148 of the Constitution, the 20th Amendment proposes to remove the offices of the President and the Prime Minister from the purview of the Auditor General, thus, not subjected to government audit. This contradicts the Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitution that specify that people hold the sovereign power of the state;   
            The proposed changes to Articles 44, 45, and 47 under the 20th Amendment seem to invalidate the mandate and independence of the Members of Parliament;   
            The proposed 20th Amendment seems to subject the public service under direct political authority;   
            The proposed 20th Amendment, by Article 103, seems to remove the independent mechanism for elections;   
            The proposed 20th Amendment, by Article 109, seems to challenge the independent existence of the judiciary;   
            The proposed 20th Amendment, by Article 122, seems to abolish the right of the people to plead justice from the judiciary;   
            The proposed 20th Amendment, by Article 153, seems to open space for embezzlement, fraud, and corruption.   

 In consideration of the above, it is quite clear what the country needs now is a new constitution that suits a modern nation to face the challenges and steer the country forward, hence not another amendment to the Constitution that undermines and paralyses aspects of democracy and humanity.  

 Therefore, we hereby kindly emphasise to the Government to foster a broad public discourse on a new constitution that suits the country, and ensure that the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution is not enacted and conform the same by the Parliament.  

  Pallekande Rathanasara Thera,     Maha Lekhakadhikari,     Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha Sangha Sabhawa,     Aththangane Sasana Rathana Thera,     Maga Lekhakadhikari,     Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya   

    No decision says Amarapura    

 However, the day after the statement was issued, the Amarapura Nikaya said in a statement that the Sangha Councils of the Amarapura Nikaya had not met and there had not been any discussion on the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution.  

 The statement further noted that no comment can be made without studying the 20th Amendment thoroughly.  

 Shastrapathi Ganthune Assaji Mahanayake Thera of the Amarapura Nikaya said his personal view is that the Executive should be more powerful than at present.  

    Catholic Bishops weigh in    

 The Catholic Bishops Conference last Tuesday (13) also rejected the proposed 20th Amendment, pointing out it fails to safeguard and protect the sovereignty of the people and warned it will not strengthen Sri Lanka’s democracy.     

 In the wake of the change of Government following the parliamentary elections, the Catholic Bishops Conference in Sri Lanka stated it’s constrained to share its grave concern to protect the sacredness of the State that transcends the mutable political and governing bodies.  

 The statement further read that the 1978 Constitution changed primarily the Westminster-type cabinet democracy to an executive presidency. Since then, 19 amendments have been made, citing various reasons. However, one cannot deny that the main reasons have been to ensure economic growth, national security, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the island nation. Apparently, the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution under consideration, does not seem to put forward any other rationale for the move.   

 “Whether it is an amendment or the drafting of a new constitution, the sovereignty of the people should always be safeguarded and protected. In all probability, the contents of the 20th Amendment will find its way into the envisioned new constitution. It is imperative then to closely examine the proposed 20th Amendment before it is voted upon in Parliament,” the Catholic Bishops Conference in Sri Lanka said.  

 The statement went on to say that the executive presidency has been the bone of contention since it was created in 1978. All elected presidents since 1994 vowed to abolish the executive presidency with powers vested in it by the 1978 Constitution and transfer power to the democratically elected Parliament, but none had the political will to do so for reasons not unknown to the people, the statement recalled. 

 The Catholic Bishops Conference in Sri Lanka emphasised that concentration of power in an individual without checks and balances does not augur well for a Democratic Socialist Republic.  

 “A two-thirds majority of the members in Parliament based on political parties does not necessarily manifest the true conscience of the people. Therefore, let the entire membership of the Parliament appoint an independent constitutional council comprising a majority of men and women of proven integrity from the society, who will take care of drafting a new constitution which ensures transparent democracy, the rule of law, and the equality of all citizens,” it said.  

 The Catholic Bishops Conference in Sri Lanka further said that it is of the view that rules need not be changed due to the vagaries and inconsistencies of individual players but to identify and elect or appoint suitable persons who will abide by the rules to safeguard truth, justice, and the wellbeing of the country. It is the bounden duty of the democratically elected Parliament to create wholesome governing structures capable of moving this country forward.  

 “The drafters must beware to plug the loopholes that lead to multiple interpretations. Greater clarity is needed if the Constitution is to serve the citizenry,” the Catholic Bishops Conference added.  

 NCC joins bandwagon    

 Meanwhile, the National Christian Council (NCC) of Sri Lanka called on the Government to preserve aspects of the 19th Amendment that promote the independence of institutions and accountable governance.  

 In a statement issued on Tuesday (13), the NCC urged the Government to make all the changes to the 20th Amendment available to the public.  

 “We call upon the Government to preserve those parts of the 19th Amendment that promote the independence of key institutions and accountable governance. Since one of the main objectives of a constitution is to protect and empower the people vis-a-vis the government, all amendments to the 20th Amendment should be made accessible to the public so that its contents can be considered before the Amendment is debated in Parliament.”  

 The NCC voiced its concern over the process and substance of the 20th Amendment.  

 “The NCC of Sri Lanka expresses its deep concern about the manner in which the 20th Amendment to the Constitution is sought to be introduced and several substantive provisions of the Amendment itself.”  ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,20A: D-day Thursday,news,0,1602980304,0,101323,,
,,"People rejected 18A, so why revert?: Vidura Wickramanayaka ",interviews," 
           ‘Good in 18A and 19A should be combined for new constitution’   
 
 By Sarah Hannan    

 State Minister of National Heritage, Performance Arts, and Rural Artists Promotion Vidura Wickramanayaka has been outspoken about his observations on the 20th Amendment and has requested a fresh constitution, rather than going for yet another amendment which is to be changed by the turning Government in another five years.  

  The Sunday Morning    this week spoke to Wickramanayaka about his thoughts on the country’s Constitution and whether he has decided on what is best for the country and its people.  

  Following are excerpts of the interview.       

 You have suggested that rather than going for another amendment to the Constitution, it is better to draft a new constitution. Can you elaborate?     

 There should be a solid constitution for a country and not amendments that are done by each turning government. The constitution is the basic law of the country; if the basic law is flawless, we can build the rest of the laws based on it.  

 But as referred to in the field of political science – the constitution could be for a generation, which is for a time span of about 30-40 years. Then, an amendment takes place every five years with each turning government; that has been the usual basis for having these amendments.  

 The Constitution was enacted in 1978 and has undergone 19 amendments by now and it is heading towards an amendment for the 20th time, which is why I said that we need to have a solid constitution; not to cater to a set of people, but to cater to an entire nation.  

 The foundation of the Constitution should be the expectations and aspirations of the people and it should be based on past experiences to solidify the present needs.  

 What are the imminent dangers you see if the 20th Amendment comes into play?     

 There could be certain dangers and there could be pros and cons of the present draft. But I am still studying the draft, and waiting for the final verdict of the Supreme Court (SC) over the petitions that are being heard.  

 Are you opposing it in its entirety or are there specifics that you would want changed?     

 I am sorry that I am unable to divulge any observations that I have over the draft 20th Amendment, as right now we are still waiting for a word from the SC.  

 I do not see the ethics behind making such statements. Once the observations are debated or deliberated by the SC or any house of law, we should let it take its course.  

 The 20th Amendment is essentially reverting back to the 18th Amendment. Do you think that the ruling party is betraying the trust of their voter base?     

 This is my personal view about the 18th Amendment – on 8 January 2015, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa lost at the presidential election, to which the 18th Amendment and its consequences had a larger impact that led him to the defeat.  

 People once rejected that Amendment. So, why should we revert to an amendment that was rejected by the people? Why can’t we go for a fresh amendment?  

 One should take the good from the 18th and the 19th Amendments and should come up with a fresh constitution.  

 If President Gotabaya Rajapaksa says that his hands are tied and he cannot perform and he cannot deliver, you can come up with a new constitution; without going back to the 18th Amendment.  

 Say that the 19th Amendment should go and we all agree on that, which is not the problem, what is needed are fresh amendments and it must be ensured that it is neither a replica of the 18th Amendment nor a replica of the 19th Amendment.  

 Your close family has been pushing you to be a voice that challenges the 20th Amendment. Are you heeding their requests or were you opposed to the draft 20th Amendment before?     

 Let me clear this once and for all – I have no connection with that person in question. I never go by their needs; I have my responsibility towards the voters of this country and the Constitution. That is where my responsibility lies.  

 Now, the very same person was proposing somebody else for the presidency but did we toe the line? We cannot go by the requests of each and every one of the family; we have our own set of principles and I am answerable to my conscience.  

 If one reads through what she circulated, it is nothing but a mudslinging campaign against me. After the first two paragraphs of its contents, she alleged that my brother and I had inherited everything from our father and she had not been given anything. So, it was a mudslinging campaign that she launched against me.  

 That had finally nothing to do with the 20th Amendment or the 19th Amendment.  

 My family are the people of Horana and Kalutara towards whom I have very high regard for and then the people of this country and the public. They are who I choose to call family.  

 The family we are born into cannot be chosen and in that there are some family members who are worse than a deadly virus.  

 It has been reported that Ape Gama, which was vested under you, has been removed. Do you think it has any connection to you publicly criticising the 20th Amendment?     

 I don’t think there is a connection between that and my remarks challenging the Government; the gazette notification was dated 25 September.  

 Do you feel let down by the party, as they failed to consult learned professionals in drafting the amendment?    

 We should have consulted the members that had a good grasp of the contents of the Constitution and could have consulted them. The SLPP (Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna) should have done that.  

 In fact, when President Gotabaya Rajapaksa came into power, he should have appointed a committee to draft a new constitution or they should have converted the legislature at the Constitutional Commission.  

 This should have been done in November 2019 soon after President Rajapaksa was elected.  

 Already a year has passed. Had the committee been appointed in November 2019, within this year, we could have completed the draft.  

 Unfortunately, we are debating these amendments, the Constitution, and all administrative things while the people are burdened with the skyrocketing cost of living and other social issues such as children who are unable to gain entry to Grade 1 for 2020. This is October and we do not know when schools will commence due to the global pandemic and the current spread of the coronavirus in Sri Lanka.  

 Mind you, the Government is now trying to import rice as well. There is extensive damage done to the environment and all these crucial issues that need to be immediately addressed are now being swept under the carpet, and we are sitting and debating whether we should pick the 20th Amendment or go for a fresh constitution.  

 It is unfortunate that we are not addressing the problems of the people and their needs at such a crucial time.  

 This has been the problem with politicians all along and even the media is not focusing on such matters anymore. Take the case of Covid-19; this is a serious health emergency that needs more attention, but we are all harping on the 20th Amendment.  

 I don’t know whether justice has been done for the people of Sri Lanka at this moment.  

 Do you believe that the 20th Amendment should be opened for a public referendum?    

 It will be decided by the SC in the coming days. We should wait until they lay down their decision and table it to Parliament.  

 Afterwards, if it is open for a debate, we would have to debate. I myself am for a new constitution.  

 Will the amendments proposed by the committee appointed by the Prime Minister to study the 20th Amendment be introduced at the committee stage of the Bill in Parliament?    

 The committee stage deliberations will take place after the SC has heard the petitions and the second reading of the draft at Parliament. Even the first reading has only been tabled; the Amendment has only been tabled. So, the second reading and the committee stage will follow.  

 With many within the ruling party and its friendly parties raising concerns over certain clauses, do you think the Government will be able to secure the two-thirds majority to pass the Amendment at Parliament?    

 It depends on what they present. If it appeals to the members, and that is what needs to be done to safeguard the interests of the country, definitely the members will rally round the 20th Amendment. We have to take this country forward and not backwards.  

 At the end of the day, we will all do what must be done; we will oppose, criticise, and redraft this amendment or draw a new constitution to ensure that a solid constitution is in place. Also, we have pledged to keep this ruling party together and will do everything in our capacity to ensure that our President and Parliament can deliver on its promises to the people, whilst strengthening the laws of the country.  

 Self-criticism is the best method and I am confident that the SLPP-led Government will be able to produce a strong constitution that would last for a generation and would not need amendments.  ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,"People rejected 18A, so why revert?: Vidura Wickramanayaka ",interviews,0,1602981411,0,101326,,
,,In the backdrop of Covid-19 | Race to increase dwindling bed capacity ,focus," By Sarah Hannan    

 Sri Lanka’s health sector is once again faced with having to make do with limited and outdated facilities as it prepares to accommodate the increasing number of Covid-19 patients who are referred to state hospitals for treatment and observation.

 Just last week, the Ministry of Health said they were considering adding 147 more hospitals to which it was to refer the Covid-19 patients who will test positive over the following few days.  

 As of 8 a.m. on Friday morning (16), the number of active Covid-19 patients who were hospitalised stood at 1,851.  

 Only 13 hospitals so far are officially equipped to treat patients who have contracted the novel coronavirus, in which total bed capacity stood at 1,691.  

 There is a disparity in patient distribution as well, and hospitals operating not only in the Colombo District but also in the Matara, Kandy, and Ampara Districts have been reportedly running out of space to accommodate patients.  

 Ministry of Health Spokesperson Dr. Jayaruwan Bandara, speaking to    The Sunday Morning,    assured they would ensure state hospitals do not get overcrowded.  

 “We are actively discussing and converting several hospitals at present in the districts that have a high risk of the disease spreading, and even the quarantine centres are to now be facilitated with treatment centres going forward so as to ensure state hospitals do not get overcrowded.”  

 He confirmed that as of Friday morning, a total of 1,851 Covid-19-positive patients were being attended to at the hospitals while an additional 322 were placed under observation.  

 Dr. Bandara also noted that only three patients were treated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (IDH), and confirmed that they were not in critical condition.  

 The hospitals commissioned to treat Covid-19 patients are the Base Hospitals at Teldeniya, Rambukkana, Minuwangoda, Homagama, Colombo East, and Welikanda; District General Hospital Hambantota; IDH; Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital, Malabe; Divisional Hospital, Laggala Pallegama; and the Rural Hospitals of Kattankudy, Kamburugamuwa, and Iranawila.  
Request fallen on deaf ears
 At the time the global health emergency over the Covid-19 outbreak was announced in March, Sri Lanka only had 500 ICU beds which were sufficient to treat only 3,000 patients a month in a normal health situation; the available number of ICU beds in Sri Lanka per 100,000 people was just above two.  

 In March, medical professionals urged the Government of Sri Lanka to consider increasing the number of ICU beds at least by five-fold in an attempt to be prepared for a worst-case scenario.  

 Given the limited resources available in the state health sector, medical experts advised that a person was to be directed to get a PCR test done only if that person suffered from the relevant symptoms as determined by the healthcare service authorities.  

 The World Health Organisation (WHO)’s recommendation was to upgrade the facilities so all those suspected of being infected are tested. Following the implementation of that step, Japan and South Korea were able to flatten the curve of increased infected patients.  

 The lack of essential protective gear was a major issue faced by nurses and other workers in Sri Lanka, according to Ragama Teaching Hospital Head Nursing Officer Menaka Priyanthi.  

 At the peak of the first wave, hospital staff had to undertake sewing the necessary PPEs (personal protective equipment) using their personal sewing machines as well.  
3.9 beds per 1,000 population
 In the most recent survey, which reflected the numbers for the year 2018, statistics published by the Medical Statistics Unit of the Ministry of Health indicated that there were 641 curative care hospitals in the government health service providing in-ward treatments.  

 Hospital beds play the key role in measuring the patient capacity of the hospital system. The total bed strength in the government health institutions was 84,728 in 2018, giving a rate of 3.9 beds per 1,000 population.  

 Private healthcare establishments mainly provide allopathic medical services.    

 Since Sri Lanka allows dual practice of services for health professionals, most health professionals work in private healthcare on a part-time basis, while being permanently employed in the government sector.  

A survey conducted in 2011 found 125 private hospitals with inpatient facilities where the total number of beds available within those facilities stood at 4,210. These private establishments admitted about 260,000 patients and treated approximately 50 million patients in outpatient departments (OPD).  

 Although outpatient department care is delivered by all hospitals and primary medical care units, patients who need more treatment and patient care are directed to in-ward care or to a nearest larger hospital when facilities are unavailable.  

 Specialised care is provided through base, district general, provincial general, teaching, and some selected specialised hospitals.  

 There are also outreach clinics occasionally conducted by specialists where continuous series of treatments are thereby managed for identified cases.  

 Curative sector PHC (primary healthcare) institutions include divisional hospitals and primary medical care units. The divisional hospitals are further classified into three categories – Type A, Type B, and Type C district hospitals.  

 All divisional hospitals are managed by a medical officer in charge who is accountable to the regional directors of health services of the district. Apart from the medical officer in charge, there are a few medical officers attached to each type of divisional hospital as well.  

 The main difference between these categories of hospitals is the number of beds available. Type A divisional hospitals usually have a bed capacity of above 50. The Ministry of Health is now appointing family medicine specialists to work in Type A divisional hospitals.  

 Type B divisional hospitals usually have the services of two to three medical officers per hospital. The bed capacity of these hospitals is usually between 20 and 50.  

 Type C hospitals have a bed capacity of less than 20, and are also served by one to two medical officers with other staff.  

 All these divisional hospitals provide maternity care services, and labour rooms are available for utilisation.  ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,In the backdrop of Covid-19 | Race to increase dwindling bed capacity ,focus,0,1602982338,0,101329,,

,,Covid-19 and social stigma,brunch," 
How are our attitudes to Covid-19 helping (or hindering) prevention efforts? 
 

 By Naveed Rozais 

 

 The impact of Covid-19 on all our lives has been felt time and time again this past year. From the anxiety and uncertainty a spike in infections brings, to the total lockdown we went through in March, this pandemic has left no one unaffected.  

 The recent second wave has brought a lot of emotions boiling to the forefront, with Sri Lanka exceeding 5,000 reported infections.  

 Chief among these emotions have been anger and finger-pointing, whether at the first reported Covid-19 patient of this new cluster, or the company she was associated with. Covid-19 has become the new taboo and while this is understandable, it is a highly infectious disease, the long-term implications of which are unknown. So, at what point does the anxiety and fear around Covid-19 become a stigma? Is it helping? Or is it making an already bad situation just that much worse?  

   
What causes this stigma? 
 Stigma is essentially bias that leads to discrimination and/or unfair treatment. It is the inherent tendency from the majority of society to view someone in a specific situation or with a specific illness negatively. National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Senior Consultant Psychiatrist Dr. Pushpa Ranasinghe explained that in many cases, stigma stems from fear. “One thing is that people fear that they will be discriminated against, that they will be segregated, and people will distance themselves. They also fear that their movements will be restricted. Lots of people also feel that it is inevitable that they will get it (Covid-19) because there is no vaccine or clear way to prevent it.”  

 A report published by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on the social stigma associated with Covid-19 shared that the stigma surrounding Covid-19 stems from the fact that Covid-19 is a new disease which comes with many unknowns. The unknown and uncertainty are some things that frighten the vast majority of us, and it is easy to associate that fear with “others”, and in doing so, blame those “others”.  

 Vaccines and Infectious Diseases Forum Sri Lanka President and consultant paediatrician Dr. H.T. Wickramasinghe shared that in our society, not just in Sri Lanka, but globally, there is always a stigma that comes with infectious diseases. Dr. Wickramasinghe said: “The Covid-19 stigma has been created without people even knowing that they’re doing it; even at the Government and law enforcement level. Take the Minuwangoda cluster for example, the worker who was first reported to have had Covid-19 has said that when she came to know she had it, the Police had allegedly come and shouted at her as if she was a culprit. But this is absolutely not the case. She is simply the victim of an illness. Now we know that many other people in the same place had Covid-19 as well, very likely before she had it herself. She was simply the first known case.   

 “We need to understand and remember that Covid-19 is an illness. A communicable illness, which means it can be spread from one person to another. Anyone can get it, regardless of their circumstances; Amitabh Bachchan and members of his family, Donald Trump, and Boris Johnson have all got it. It’s not something that affects only certain people.”  

   
The impact of Covid-19 stigma
 The basic fear and uncertainty of getting Covid-19 is being compounded by a layer of social stigma and discrimination. Stigma in any situation makes things difficult. It prevents open discussion and promotes insularity. It makes people less receptive to dealing with the situation, from both sides of the equation, be it accepting the problem and coming forward with it or dealing with it carefully and safely finding solutions.  

 Covid-19 is no different. “The whole problem is society has created this impression that stops people from coming forward,” Dr. Wickramasinghe commented, adding: “Looking at the first patient from the Minuwangoda cluster, horrible things were said about her in the media, some going so far as to designate her a prostitute. Do you think anyone will be willing to come forward with symptoms? They will be more worried about the kinds of things society will say, and their families needing to deal with such things.”  

 The WHO also noted that stigma can often lead to situations where the virus is more, not less, likely to spread. Stigma can drive people to hide their symptoms and stop them from seeking effective healthcare immediately. It can also discourage them from adopting healthy behaviours that in other situations would help reduce the spread of the virus. For example, they may keep showing up to work despite knowing they’re not well because they can’t tell anyone they’re not feeling well and take two weeks to a month off without drawing attention to themselves. This puts them at risk of passing the virus on to their co-workers who can spread it on to their families and close contacts and so on.  

   
Beating the stigma: The power of our words 
 Beating stigma is a war that needs to be fought on multiple fronts. One very important tool to overcome stigma is our words. “The language people use is very negative,” Dr. Wickramasinghe said, adding: “In Sinhala especially, they say things like    thawa ekkenek ahuwuna    (another one has got caught). Why use words like caught? Even in the papers, words like ‘suspect’ are used. Why use the word suspect? The attitude of treating victims of Covid-19 like culprits is very present and this needs to change. They’re not criminals. Society using language like this has made it so that people don’t like to go to the hospital or even admit they have symptoms. Threats by the Government on legal action and confiscating properties and similar things of those who don’t come forward are also adding to the problem. We need to remember that people who have Covid-19 haven’t done anything wrong. Anyone can get Covid-19.”  

 The WHO report also stressed the importance of language, encouraging the use of phrases like “people who have Covid-19”, “people who are being treated for Covid-19”, “people who are recovering from Covid-19”, or “people who died after contracting Covid-19”, as opposed to phrases like “Covid-19 cases” or “victims”. 

 Instead of using terms like “Covid-19 suspects” or “suspected cases”, phrases like “people who may have Covid-19” or “people who are presumptive for Covid-19” should be used.  

 When speaking about people contracting Covid-19, we must not talk about people “transmitting Covid-19”, “infecting others”, or “spreading the virus”. This implies intentional transmission and assigns blame. More approachable ways of discussing this are through terms like “acquiring” or “contracting” Covid-19.  

   
Beating the stigma: Being mindful
 It is always important to be mindful. Misinformation breeds stigma. Be mindful of what information you see and share. Do a little research. Make sure the information you’re sharing comes from a reliable source. Don’t share highly technical information that is difficult to understand, unless you’re sharing it with people who you know will understand that terminology. Challenge myths and stereotypes that promote a negative sentiment.  

 Dr. Ranasinghe shared that one form of stigma is the perception that Covid-19 is rampant among those who are less fortunate, like, in the case of the Minuwangoda cluster, factory workers. “We have to accept that it is not a disease of a lower socioeconomic class or anything like that. It’s to do with your immune system. Anyone’s immune system can get affected.”  

 Dr. Ranasinghe noted that Sri Lanka’s death toll has been very low, indicating that we are able to overcome this and that Sri Lanka’s healthcare system is able to fight it.  

 Dr. Wickramasinghe commented on Sri Lanka in particular, noting that South and Southeast Asia, in general, have had lower mortality rates than the west. “The most rational explanation for this is that the strain of Covid-19 that we’re fighting is not as virulent as that in the US and Europe. There are also lots of other potential explanations; one could be our unique Southeast Asian diet, we eat a lot of turmeric and other spices that boost immunity.”  

 Dr. Wickramasinghe stressed the importance of being mindful with preventing the spread of Covid-19. “The problem with Covid-19 is that it is highly infectious and spreads rapidly, even though it is droplet-borne,” Dr. Wickramasinghe explained, adding: “The important thing is to take proper precautions. It is essential to follow the instructions issued by the Ministry of Health; washing hands, wearing masks, and avoiding crowds. One of the biggest causes of Covid-19 spread is from assembly, whether it is parties, meetings, etc.  

 “Social distancing is not in place simply to protect yourself, it is to control the spread of the virus. If the spread gets out of control, the number of people requiring concentrated medical care like hospital and ICU treatment will exceed our threshold and capacity. This puts doctors in the uncomfortable position of needing to prioritise who to treat and in eventualities, who to resuscitate.”  

 Dr. Wickramasinghe further explained: “This is what happened in Italy and Spain. Elderly people were not ventilated because the priority was to ventilate younger people. It was not fair, but doctors had no choice. Social distancing keeps the rate of infection plateaued, so it is manageable.”  

  The importance of being kind 
 The power of being kind is one that simply cannot be underestimated, and kindness and warmth is something Sri Lanka is known for the world over. Now, more than ever, is the time for that kindness to shine. Let’s band together to create a more understanding and welcoming society. Covid-19 doesn’t need to define us. Like everything else, it too shall pass. ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Covid-19 and social stigma,brunch,0,1602975652,0,101333,,
,,Ethical journalism in Sri Lanka: A work in progress?,brunch," 
By Dinithi Gunasekera  

 

 The recent resurgence of Covid-19 in the island has also brought into focus occasions where some established news outlets, particularly online, have failed to adhere to ethics when reporting about Covid-19 cases. 

 Such reporting has caused severe backlash from the general public, who call for a more nuanced and ethics-driven approach to be adopted by digital media platforms in Sri Lanka. 

 Picture this.   Your flatmate has tested positive for the novel coronavirus and has been rushed away for isolated treatment. All your friends, family and well-meaning neighbours (for the most part), are petrified of your presence. You are rushed to an ambulance assisted by sanitized medical staff and police clad in protective gear from head to toe. You are surrounded: A dozen reporters asking your name, hurried camera-men. Then: Lights! Camera! Action! Your space and your energy are swamped by an unbearable amount of attention you have never received. Suddenly your face is on national television and all over Facebook. All for the wrong reasons. 

 The media is regarded as the messiah of righteous truth, and equivocally, it is at the butt end of any and all criticism. In Sri Lankan media’s questionable stance on ethical journalism, there seems to be more than what meets the eye. 

 Amongst the plethora of mass media outlets, the most time-honoured and trusty constituent is the press, where in some parts of the world, digital media is still a relatively new phenomenon. 

 Digital news media includes online journalism, blogging, digital photojournalism, citizen journalism, and social media. Although a vibrant addition to the existing collective of mass media, digital news media is on the slippery side of things in the context of Sri Lanka, the reason being the absence of a written Code of Ethics for the said medium. 

 Sri Lanka Press Council (SLPC) Press Commissioner Niroshan Thambawita was eager to elaborate on the legal perspective of it all. According to Thambawita, an Act in 1973 talks of the right to produce a Code of Ethics for Mass Media. It was accordingly carried out for press media through Gazette No. 162/5A of 1981, consisting of 11 statements and clauses. 

SLPC and the press
 When defamation or any such infringement occurs from the side of the media, the only organisation to lodge complaints with, which would work towards resolving the issue, is the SLPC. 

 Thambawita described the SLPC as an institution that strives to respect and protect the freedom of mass media while safeguarding the rights of the people. At instances of detriment where mass media is involved, the Council acts as a mediating body that is free of the rigidity of governmental interface whilst being rather courteous in its conduct. Although it is gazetted under the Ministry of Mass Media, it has powers similar to a district court and functions as an independent council that is entrusted to do justice at the end of the day. 

 Though particularly prominent during the Easter Sunday attacks in April 2019, where many news items were motivated by racial prejudice and misinformation, within the press media, there are very limited reported incidents of the infringement of people’s rights, said Thambawita. 

 The prohibition of race-based discrimination is a leading statement in the 1981 guidelines. There is another such prohibition on mentioning names, location, and photographs of relevant individuals with regard to sexual abuse of minors. 

 In press journalism, in addition to the actual journalists themselves, there are also editors, subeditors, etc., through whom the news item is checked repeatedly and necessary amendments are made, which is one of the reasons why infringement of peoples’ rights is limited through the press. 

 “When such an incident occurs with regard to the press, we notify the Editor-in-Chief about that allegedly infringing news item using the mandate of the 1981 Code of Ethics and a sort of investigation procedure is conducted. Afterwards, both parties consisting of the responsible media personnel and the complainant would be invited to the premises and further investigations would be conducted by the Board of Directors of the Press Council. It should be noted that the procedure is, at all times, courteous and impartial,” explained the Press Commissioner. 

 Digital media in focus
 In addition to the absence of an arbitrary code that governs the ethical use of digital media, the very nature of social media is challenging in nature in terms of overseeing ethics. 

 TV Derana General Manager of Digital Media and IdeaHell General Manager Janeeth Rodrigo, in an exchange with    The Sunday Morning Brunch   , shared that media personnel within the scope of digital media are currently working with a set of guidelines they themselves set, which is also policed by them. 

 “Unfortunately, when the debate about how these ethics should be enforced comes up, there’s always backlash, especially from the media industry as a whole, where they consider themselves ‘the champions of the people’. We are very averse to any guideline arbitrarily given from outside of the industry, which I think is one of the main problems at present,” shared Rodrigo. 

 The SLPC Press Commissioner used the metaphor of water to elaborate the nature of social media. Flowing water neither has direction nor regulation. It flows freely and at times recklessly, if not contained. It can be both beneficial and destructive. While water is used for drinking and household purposes, the same water can be responsible for the occurrence of tsunamis, floods, and other calamities. 

 Rodrigo, further adding to his comment, noted: “It’s a massive grey area as to what constitutes libel or slander that happens on an online platform. Dealing with social media and ethics is difficult because it’s very platform-specific. If we take the most popular social media platform Facebook into account, there’s a set of community guidelines that determines what is ethical and what is not.” 

 Most of the time, social media users are not aware or educated of the ethics that media and journalism abide by. With the rise of the new phenomenon of “influencers”, a segment of individuals who have risen to popularity in popular social media platforms are able to make a greater impact on people than the press. 

 “The problem with digital media is that everyone is in a hurry to report. There is a lot of competition involved. In terms of us as a media agency, we strive to prioritise what’s accurate even if we are not the first to report it,” stated Rodrigo. 

 In any case of digital media or social media infringement, the two organisations that assist in resolving the issue are the Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (SLCERT) and the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). Rodrigo added that he personally knows that they are quite efficient and prompt in what they do. The problem-solving protocol not only consists of contacting the relevant social media platform directly, but it also takes legal action locally. 

 From his expertise gained in digital media at Derana, Rodrigo revealed that there is a limit that the media organisation can do to counteract infringement caused due to fake news; it can make official announcements to control whatever damage that has been caused. 

 “Additionally, platforms such as Facebook are the most used social media and also the most abused. Facebook has direct links with almost all leading Sri Lankan digital media networks. When there is something going on that is fake and potentially detrimental, we reach out to them and action is taken accordingly. 

 “As a media organisation, what we follow is the gatekeeper philosophy. The news item is passed through at least six to eight individuals before it is released, starting from the regional reporter to the regional news editor and so on. Still, with that being said, there still could be infringements that occur.” 

 
  The media industry  
 “The biggest problem by far is that we as an industry cannot and do not comprehend that there is a problem at hand,” expressed Rodrigo. 

 Rodrigo is of the opinion that firstly, we have to identify the existence of a problem in order to look for a solution. “If the industry fixes that as a collective, then there would be no need for legal intervention, but the best possible step is for the industry to come to terms with the state authorities and agree on certain essential guidelines.” 

 “There is also an apparent generational gap. The media industry is still dominated by a ‘bunch of dinosaurs’ who are very used to the way of doing things the way they have been doing it over the years. So at times, it’s difficult for people with new ideas to have a say in things. I believe there should be a compromise and a middle ground. We cannot continue to do things the way we did it and expect the results to change,” said Rodrigo. 

 
  A personalised code of ethics  
 SLPC Press Commissioner Thambawita revealed that at the moment, there is proactive discussion between the relevant authorities such as a panel of mass media journalists, news directors, and mass media unions in collaboration with the Ministry of Mass Media on the prompt need for an individualised Code of Ethics and a monitoring mechanism not only covering the scope of electronic media, but also for social media. It is learnt that a discussion was also held a couple of weeks ago with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. 

 The President’s manifesto “Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour” itself mentions that the Press Council should be inclusive of other types of media. 

 “A workshop on the importance of the theoretic base for the proposal was scheduled to be discussed with mass media experts and professors in universities on 15 October. It was however postponed due to the resurgence of the Covid-19 outbreak. It was aimed as input sessions to aid the production of an official Code of Ethics and overseeing mechanisms.” 

 
  Negative impact and bigger picture  
 “During the past few weeks, we have seen how certain digital media reporters covered the Covid-19-positive patients by invoking a thriller film-based effect through the misuse of patients, disregarding their rights as dignified human beings. The reputations of these individuals are nothing but mere stories for them, as if it were a hunt for destructive drugs,” commented the Press Commissioner. 

 “In addition to the infringement of human rights, more damage was caused by the unnecessary social anxiety that was created by these media personnel, causing Covid-19-positive patients to go into hiding, resist treatment, and run away from their households. No one would want their families, neighbours, friends, households, or belongings to be telecast on national television for all to see.” 

 
  Formal education: A cure to all ills?  
 “Most of the time, it’s regional reporters and correspondents who engage in unethical journalism to gain the spotlight and gain a spot on the news bulletins,” opined Rodrigo. 

 He said that media organisations treat regional correspondents quite offhandedly. “We don't consider them as one of our employees. The unfortunate repercussion of this is that it leaves room for an unaccredited handful to represent the media, in both the good and bad. They do a lot of good work as well, such as educating the public on social problems they never knew existed as opposed to main media personnel who utilise a very top-down approach to things. 

 “However, the lack of training is definitely one of the issues. If all media organisations can cumulatively train their regional reporters and correspondents, it would greatly mitigate this problem that we have at hand.” 

 A formal education appears to be a deciding factor, which is the case with most problems in Sri Lanka. All the media organisations have to ensure that due training is given to its employees. 

 
  Cumulative freedom of mass media  
 There’s a thin line between freedom of speech and expression, and respecting the rights of the people. If media personnel feel they have the right to unjustly utilise the identity of the common man for the benefit of the media organisation, it is only fair that the people exercise their right to seek justice in the case of the violation of rights, expressed the SLPC Press Commissioner. 

 “Freedom of speech is not reduced by following a Code of Ethics; it is complete slander in itself, motivated by selected groups, certainly not all, within the network.” 

 There are also many instances where the relevant media personnel in question are wrongly accused, in which case after the course of justice through the proceedings of the Council, due credit is given to the particular reporter for his/her work. 

 There are also many issues covered in the Code of Ethics for the press media, such as plagiarism, which is another factor that should be addressed regarding digital media. 

 “The making of a legal framework does not mean the repression of the freedom of the press, and the freedom of speech and expression. This is not an issue of censorship but rather about moving forward as a society where information is abundant yet ethically obtained.” 

 SLPC Press Commissioner Thambawita confessed, however, that the 1973 Act should definitely be amended and restructured in a manner that is appropriate for today’s developed society. 

 
International examples  
  
  In relation to the global stage, ethical journalism is governed by a variety of mandates, some of which are specialized to specific news agencies.    The IFJ Global Charter of Ethics for Journalists    is one such internationally recognized declaration. The Charter is based on major texts of international law, in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  

 However, the stray from ethical journalism practices is not something exclusive to Sri Lanka as there are many examples of such gross violations in the global stage from the case of Yazidi women’s painful testimonies on the practices of journalists who covered their stories to prime examples for fake news and misinformation on the world stage such as the Buzzfeed report on President-elect Donald Trump   that was based on uncorroborated, unverified work via third-party intelligence.  

 For a country such as Sri Lanka, it is apparent that we have ample room for improvement and to achieve more ethical standards in media. 

    “Sensationalizing a story does bring in more views, it shouldn't violate anyone's rights or bring harm to anyone,” shared Muqaddasa Wahid, a young print journalist of one of the leading news outlets in Sri Lanka. 

 “As a print journalist, our code of ethics restricts us from such actions and when we see digital and electronic media doing such stories, there is an immense pressure on print media journalists to do the same, which sometimes can be very taxing on our mental health, career and integrity. Such acts happening is a black mark on the whole journalism industry in the country and questions the integrity of the media, which affects many journalists who are honest in their work and work hard to ensure they put out true stories ensuring no harm is done to anyone.”

,,"""I basically marched into the interview room"" - Rehan Alexander Mudannayake",brunch,"‘DIDI’ – a film by Rehan Alexander Mudannayake
Selected for the Academy Award-qualifying HollyShorts Film Festival
 

 By Dimithri Wijesinghe 

 

 DIDI is the story of a young British Indian faced with a momentous decision when reunited with her long-lost sister. Directed by Rehan Alexander Mudannayake, the film has been selected – from over 6,000 submissions – for the Academy Award-qualifying HollyShorts Film Festival. 

 We reached out to Mudannayake, Founder of Odyssey Film Company and best known for his 2015 short film Elephant, which was about the Colombo elite in Sri Lanka, to speak about how DIDI as a project came to be, and how he as a Sri Lankan student, studying at University College London, came to direct a short film about Indian sisters reuniting; also that it got nominated by a prestigious film festival and praised by Academy Award nominee Deepa Mehta herself. 


 

 How did this project come about? How did you happen upon this story and why did you choose to tell this particular story? 

 

 I was a couple of months into my degree at University College London (UCL), and I was studying a mix of cinema, political history, and cultural studies with a focus on cinema and when I began to feel a little restless because my degree was entirely theoretical, this was a conscious decision I made, but I felt compelled to get out into the field and make a film during my time in London. So I was rather thrilled when my friend came to me and said that our university film society is commissioning a series of short films. 

 I didn’t know much about UCL’s film society so I did a bit of digging and found out that Christopher Nolan (who directed the Batman films) was part of their past alumni and was president of the film society, where he started making films; it was where he first met Emma Thomas, his long-time production partner, and also his wife. 

 I then had a read of the selected script for term one and it was just the most moving and most powerful script I had read in a long time. It was written by a very, very young 21-year-old English literature graduate, Radhika Jani, and it was her very first script. It was the most thought-provoking piece of writing I had read in a long time, and I thought to  myself I have to make this film. I basically marched into the interview room and demanded that they give me the position. 

 I was lucky enough to be given the directorial position and basically spent the next two or three weeks prepping for the film which was shot over two nights. 

 One of the very first conversations Radhika and I had in pre-production was how frustrated we were with the depiction of the South Asian community in western cinema. We’ve all seen films that focus on young women being forced into arranged marriages and beaten by their abusive husbands. Not to say that these stories aren’t important or relevant, but we thought that it was time to expand the industry’s repertoire to other stories as well, and I think that is how DIDI came about. 

 

 What was the filming and casting process like?   

 

 The film society very graciously funded the film, and I think we ended up casting it through social media Insta stories; we put out all these casting tweets, WhatsApp messages, emailed amateur theatre groups, and in two days we had 16 South Asian actresses walk in through the door and audition for us. We then had about a week to rehearse and then over the course of two days we shot the film. I remember we started on a Saturday at 5 a.m., finished at 12 a.m., and then went back to set on Sunday at 5 a.m. and ended at 5 p.m. It was just the wildest shoot ever but so much fun. 

 What was great about this film was the fact that for a lot of the crew it was their very first time making a film, and a lot of them were studying other subjects – everything from philosophy to English literature, economics, and human sciences – but everybody was bound by this love for cinema and it was just the most amazing team. 

 Editing took about a year; I sat with my fantastic editor Hal for maybe two to three nights every week, and I think by September last year we finished cutting it. 

 

 The story is of a British Indian girl and her journey. As a Sri Lankan born educated largely in England, what was your experience like directing this particular story? 

 

 Even though it was directed over there, my experiences are quite different than those of the characters of the story, and I really relied on this fantastic team of women that I worked with to help me check my ego and essentially make sure I portray the story in an authentic, meaningful, and respectful manner. 

 What was also fantastic about the film crew was that over 60% of the crew were international students and I think 70% of the set were women; I think that representation was key to making a film of this nature. Essentially every single change that was made during pre-production was sanctioned by Radhika – I mean we had a whole list of changes and I would sit down with her and discuss them and make sure that we were on the right track and make sure I didn’t misrepresent the characters of the film. 

 

 DIDI has been selected for the HollyShorts Film Festival. What does this mean to you as a filmmaker, to be accorded such recognition? And do you think your film has what it takes to win? 

 

 I am thrilled that it made it into HollyShorts, precisely because it is such a selective festival. It is notoriously difficult to get into because it is an Academy Award-qualifying film festival, which basically means that it belongs to this elite group of Oscar-accredited film festivals. And in eight years of making films, this is the first Academy Award-qualifying film festival I’ve gotten into. 

 I have gotten into other film festivals but this is probably the biggest one so far, and essentially a festival’s Oscar accreditation means that if it wins at a festival, it gets admitted to the Oscars. So yeah, I am just chuffed that we got this far and it is just amazing. 

 And whilst I do believe the film has the potential to win, just the mere fact that it has gotten this far in HollyShorts is just the most amazing feeling. 

 

 Academy Award nominee Deepa Mehta said about your film: “Evocative and excellent. I loved DIDI."" How did that make you feel? 

 

 I nearly fell off my chair when I received her comments on the film. She is one of my cinematic heroes, one of the world’s greatest directors, a true visionary, and one I have learnt a lot from. So I was just so thrilled that she watched my film and liked it. It meant a great deal to me. 

 

 As the Founder of film production studio Odyssey based in Sri Lanka, in your experience, what can you say about the state of the Sri Lankan film industry; where are we at on a global scale, and why do you think we are where we are? 

 

 I think Sri Lanka produces cinema of an incredibly high standard; you needn’t look further than internationally successful directors like Vimukthi Jayasundara, Asoka Handagama, and Prasanna Withanage. 

 I mean, sure, we have been hit pretty hard by Covid, but we are a resilient lot and I have no doubt we will bounce back. 

 

 How did you get into filmmaking and what’s it been like as a Sri Lankan who makes films? What can you say to anyone who wishes to pursue it as a career? 

 

 I have always wanted to be a filmmaker and I think I was inspired by my mom and her love for photography. From a very young age I learnt how to load 35 mm into a point and shoot a camera, and I think that inspired me to then pick up a video camera and start telling stories. 

 If making films is your calling, you should absolutely pursue it as a career. It is not lucrative when you first start out and I think you are going to have to be creative with how you make money. I for one have spent the last six to seven years directing ad campaigns for corporates and shooting documentaries for NGOs (non-governmental organisations) and the UN (United Nations), and that is how I have been able to fund my short films. I think you have to be a little thick-skinned and must prepare yourself for rejection and years of failure if you do want to succeed eventually. 

 

 What are your thoughts on the current trend of filmmaking, which is essentially adaptations and sequels aimed at getting people to the cinemas? Is it important to make art house films and thought-provoking short films that appeal to a few, or is it necessary to appeal to the masses? 

 

 I think it is a crying shame that the vast majority of adaptations and sequels coming out these days suffer from lazy unoriginal storytelling. 

 As for the rest, I think it is a personal choice. I personally want to make films that are critically acclaimed but also have widespread appeal amongst the masses. I certainly don’t believe in making a film that goes to a fancy film festival and is only understood by an elite group of film critics and wins an award and is never watched again. I certainly want my films to live on and I want my film to appeal to as many people as possible. 

 And I think there is a way to do that, to hit that middle ground while maintaining one’s creative integrity. 

 

 What are your plans for the future? Any upcoming projects you can share with us? 

 

 My most exciting upcoming project is “Funny Boy”, Deepa Metha’s adaptation of Shyam Selvadurai’s literary masterpiece in which I play one of the leads.

,,Madagascar opposes ‘Ceylon cinnamon’ : Claims Sri Lanka lacks Indigenousness,business," By Madhusha Thavapalakumar 

 Madagascar has objected to Sri Lanka’s application to the European Union (EU) requesting them to grant Geographical Indication (GI) for the country’s cinnamon as “Ceylon cinnamon”. 

 Department of Export Agriculture Special Research Director Dr. J.M. Seneviratne told The Sunday Morning Business that these objections were raised by the East African island nation when the EU called for statements of objection recently. 

 The GI is a sign used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation that is attributed to that origin. In order to function as a GI, a sign must identify a product as originating in a given place. In addition, the qualities, characteristics, or reputation of the product should be essentially due to the place of origin. 

 Even though calls for objection are still open, Madagascar is the only country that has objected to Sri Lanka’s application so far. 

 “The objection has been made by the Madagascar authorities on the grounds that ‘Ceylon cinnamon’ is not a variety and they too grow Ceylon cinnamon,” said Dr. Seneviratne. 

 Outside Sri Lanka, Madagascar is one of the countries where Ceylon cinnamon or so-called “true cinnamon” grows in abundance. While the cinnamon tree is native to Sri Lanka, according to Madagascar Spices Company, it was introduced to Madagascar in the 17th Century by sailors crossing the Indian Ocean on their trading routes and since then, Madagascar has been promoting their cinnamon as “Ceylon cinnamon”. 

 Scientific names for Madagascar's cinnamon are Cinnamomum Zeylanicum (Ceylon cinnamon) and Cinnamomum verum (true cinnamon). Partly for historical reasons and partly because of the reference to Ceylon, Cinnamomum Zeylanicum is still today the widely used botanical name for the cinnamon plant. 

 If Sri Lanka receives the “Ceylon cinnamon” GI, Madagascar cinnamon would face issues promoting their cinnamon as Ceylon cinnamon, as the Ceylon cinnamon with the GI would have higher acceptance and recognition in international markets, The Sunday Morning Business learns. 

 Nevertheless, Dr. Seneviratne stated that even though Madagascar has Ceylon cinnamon, the cinnamon peeling methods that are used in Sri Lanka are indigenous to the country and when providing the GI, such unique components too are taken into consideration. 

 “Their objection is vague. We can defend their objection and get the GI,” Dr. Seneviratne expressed with confidence. 

 Obtaining GI for Sri Lanka’s cinnamon has long been in the pipeline under consecutive governments. Lack of required provisions in the Intellectual Property Act of the country and high costs involved in preparing for GI application are said to be the reasons for the delay. 

 However, last week, the Cabinet of Ministers approved a proposal by the Ministry of Trade to advise the Legal Draftsman to draft a bill to amend the Intellectual Properties Act of No. 36 of 2003 with the provisions to establish a comprehensive and definite legal framework for the registration of GIs in Sri Lanka. 

 After obtaining the GI, Ceylon cinnamon can be sold in international markets for much higher prices than at the moment as the country would be able to maintain the traceability and quality of its spices. 

 “Once the final product reaches the global market with its very unique identity, we will get higher prices for our products. By higher, I mean five to six times higher,” Dr. Seneviratne added.

  Sri Lankan wildlife authorities unaware of what is going on in their own backyard  
 
By Dimithri Wijesinghe   

 

 The Wetahirakanda Nature Reserve (Tier IV) is a highly protected area and a designated wild elephant corridor connecting the Udawalawe National Park to the Lunugamvehera National Park, and through it runs the A2 Highway, that is the Colombo-Galle-Hambantota-Wellawaya Road. 

 Climate Action Now Sri Lanka (CAN Sri Lanka), a volunteer-driven local initiative, recently shared that they had discovered a large number of H&amp;M labels buried in this protected area amongst other waste in a garbage cluster. 

 Speaking to The Sunday Morning Brunch, CAN Sri Lanka stated: “A few months ago, we heard from one of the team members about a section of the Wetahirakanda Nature Reserve (Tier IV), which serves a secondary dual purpose as a wild elephant corridor, being highly polluted due to the trash that's being dumped there. We organised a group of volunteers to go there on 3 October and managed to clean up most of the waste and sent the recyclable waste for recycling.” They added: “During the clean-up, we came across a bunch of H&amp;M labels in a specific location that was around 50 metres inside from the Colombo-Galle-Hambantota-Wellawaya Road.” 

 They shared that as they were collecting them, their volunteers realised there were a lot more buried in the ground, and they managed to collect thousands of H&amp;M labels, all of which had been discarded along with the other non-recyclable waste they found during the clean-up. 

 Considering the brand name attached to the discarded labels, we reached out to the clothing retail company H&amp;M, and H&amp;M Group Communications Press Officer Laura Engels stated: “We take this extremely seriously and we are currently investigating how this could have happened and will make sure that the necessary steps are being taken.” 

 
  Clueless authorities?  
 

 The Wetahirakanda Nature Reserve (Tier IV) is protected under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance as per the Extraordinary Gazette No. 1239/28 (dated 7 June 2002). Therefore, it is under the governance of the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC). However, when we reached out to the authorities, the information regarding the incident had not yet reached them. 

 DWC Publicity Officer Hasini Sarachchandra said: “The Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance has declared the area of state land described as Wetahirakanda to be a national reserve for the purposes of the Ordinance and is therefore accorded the same protection, and so these areas are protected, and discarding garbage in these lands is illegal. 

 “However, we have not yet heard about this particular incident but we will take measures to look into the matter as it is serious. 

 “The area has experienced issues in the past; back when the Mattala (Rajapaksa International) Airport was being built and then the Southern Highway, it did face many issues, and so we will take measures to look into the matter.” 

 We also reached out to the office of the Southern Wildlife Region which overlooks the protected areas in the South. Speaking to DWC Southern Wildlife Region Assistant Director Channa Suraweera, under whose purview the Wetahirakanda Nature Reserve (Tier IV) falls, he shared that he too was unaware of this particular incident and that once they receive the geotag of the location they will investigate further. 

 We asked Suraweera about the nature of the protection afforded to these areas, and how they execute the protection that is given to them via the Ordinance; he shared that essentially, the way they go about it is by setting up demarcations and signposts in order to make the public aware that they are in fact protected areas. “We have DWC boundary poles and signboards put up. We do not have patrol officers and such who are deployed; however, there are certain stations sanctioned across these protected areas, starting at the best stations at the primary level and then range offices which have rangers who are given the task of monitoring these areas.” 

 He said that the primary protection of course comes from the fact that they are gazetted and the assumption is that the citizens of the country are aware of the Gazette. However, practically, this is not the case and so they put up signposts to help keep people in line. 

 While the authorities were forthcoming with the information they shared, it was rather disappointing to learn that while even someone with just a passing interest in the environment has heard of this issue of the garbage cluster, none of the relevant authorities appeared to be aware of what is going on in their own backyard. 

 
  Soon becoming a trend  
 

 Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ) Executive Director Hemantha Withanage addressed this matter of the relevant authorities either lacking interest, resources, or the knowhow to follow through and enforce the law. 

 Withanage commented on this particular incident where the garbage cluster was discovered, sharing that it is often a middleman who is carrying out these activities, not the waste company itself. He said: “There was an incident that happened during the height of the pandemic where toxic plastic containers in four lorry loads were being burnt in Kataragama, and those involved were apprehended by the Police. 

 “There was another incident with regards to liquid waste where five bowsers of waste were dumped in Modara and the court has since intervened in these activities,” he said. 

 He shared that this dumping of waste in protected areas is soon becoming a trend due to the highway waste manufacturers taking their waste to be dumped in the South. All the designated dumps are now full, including the dumps in Muthurajawela, which also originally started with compostable waste. 

 He pointed out that there is a serious lack of awareness and knowledge amongst the local authorities in charge of protecting these lands, stating that every industry must be required to apply for an environment protection license which covers the element of waste management. Officers at the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) are unaware of the critical questions they must ask when they issue these licenses, especially how these industries plan to discard their waste. 

 “People are saying that you can tell the CEA anything and they will believe it, which to an extent is true as they are simply unaware,” said Withanage. He further explained that there is no knowledge on sanitary landfills of liquid and solid waste, and at this point the acquiring of this license which is there to protect our ecosystem has become just a routine matter. 

 
  A good example should be set  
 

 Movement for Land and Agricultural Reform Environment and Legal Officer and Environmental Conservation Trust Director Sajeewa Chamikara also shared his thoughts, stating that often it is in the hands of the authorities to set a good example, and they simply have not done so. 

 Chamikara said that this particular area in question is highly protected and its protection falls under the DWC, and he stated that he can say with certainty that this is a result of the bad example set by local authorities. 

 He said there are 58 garbage dumps used by these local authorities which are totally illegal and are situated in areas protected by the Forest Department and under the Ordinance, and the reason they continue to operate is because the CEA has repeatedly failed to take effective and necessary action. “Now people think that they can get away with it, because everyone is just doing it with no consequences,” he said. 

 As a result, Chamikara shared that due to these areas being sensitive plots of land, these foreign pollutants not only fuel the human-elephant conflict (HEC) as a result of the constant encroachment of these lands and disturbance to elephants’ corridors; they also really affect the biodiversity of these protected areas.   ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Sri Lankan wildlife authorities unaware of what is going on in their own backyard,brunch,0,1602969873,0,101341,,
,,China FTA slow and steady to prevent another Singapore,business,"State Minister of Regional Co-operation Tharaka Balasuriya

 By Madhusha Thavapalakumar 

 Sri Lankan authorities are reviewing the provisions of the proposed Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with China to ensure it would not turn out to be “another Singapore FTA”, State Minister of Regional Co-operation Tharaka Balasuriya told The Sunday Morning Business. 

 “The proposed China FTA is a huge document and there is a lot of negativity towards Sri Lanka. We are reviewing the contents and assessing Harmonised System (HS) codes because we do not need a repeat of what happened with the Singapore FTA,” the State Minister stated. 

 Despite strong opposition from professional associations and other bodies, Sri Lanka entered into an FTA with Singapore, called the “Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement” (SLSFTA), in January 2018, following 18 months of negotiations. The opposition was mainly on two grounds. One, that the agreement endangered Sri Lankan jobs by allowing the entrance of Singaporean skilled labour and professionals. Two, that it would open the floodgates for the importation of clinical and nuclear waste, making Sri Lanka a dumping ground for Singapore. 

 In the face of unrelenting opposition and lobbying, both in the political and professional spheres, former President Maithripala Sirisena appointed an independent committee a few months later, comprising five experts to study the SLSFTA and to submit a report. 

 During an official visit to Singapore in January 2019, President Sirisena, referring to the FTA, said that certain weaknesses of the Sri Lankan side were evident in the drafting of the agreement and therefore he expects to make amendments to rectify this. In May 2019, Sri Lanka proposed setting up a joint committee with Singapore to amend the SLSFTA, and Balasuriya told us that its provisions are still being reviewed. 

 Meanwhile, China is the world’s second largest economy and an FTA with it has been coveted by Sri Lanka for many years. Negotiations on this FTA finally commenced in 2016, but came to a virtual standstill by 2018. This was due to Sri Lanka’s insistence on reviewing the agreement every 10 years, to which China was strongly opposed due to its willingness to have longer term stability, according to Sri Lanka’s then Chief Trade Negotiator K.J. Weerasinghe, as reported by Reuters in May 2018. 

 Nevertheless, during a meeting with Sri Lanka President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa on 9 October in Colombo and a high-level Chinese delegation, Sri Lanka and China agreed on the need to resume negotiations on the stalled talks on the Sri Lanka-China FTA. According to Balasuriya, Sri Lanka is reviewing the agreement before getting back to China on resuming the negotiations. 

 The massive difference in bargaining power between the two nations also meant that China insisted on a zero-tariff regime which would have overwhelmingly benefited them due to the bilateral trade relationship being dominated by China’s exports to Sri Lanka.

,,Govt.’s pending payments to construction sector : Promissory letters worth Rs. 226b issued,business,"Treasury Secretary S.R. Attygalle

 By Madhusha Thavapalakumar 

 Under the “Letter of Acceptance of Payments of Outstanding Bills Due to Contractors (LAPC)” financing facility, the Treasury has issued over Rs. 226 billion worth of letters to contractors for state construction projects until last week.  

 Treasury Secretary S.R. Attygalle told    The Sunday Morning Business    that outstanding payments to the sector for state projects carried out for the former Government was originally a total of Rs. 242 billion, meaning that only for Rs. 16 billion more needs to be covered by the letters.  

 “We have issued letters for those who have done work for highways and education. Those are the main ones. Roughly about Rs. 10 billion worth of letters have been issued to them. The pending Rs. 16 billion is for land projects and road construction. This too will be issued soon,” Attygalle stated. 

 Taking into account the financial struggles faced by the country’s construction companies over the past few years and the outstanding payments to the sector from the Government, the Central Bank on 26 June introduced a liquidity facility scheme to support the construction sector through licensed commercial banks (LCBs) based on a directive from the Treasury. 

 Accordingly, backed by a LAPC from the Treasury, LCBs were directed to provide promissory notes to contractors secured by pledged Treasury bills and Treasury bonds in their own holding, to the Central Bank to obtain credit facilities at a concessionary interest rate of 4% to construction companies. According to Attygalle, the Treasury will make all payments as per the promissory notes before 31 December 2020. 

 Within three weeks since the announcement of the loan, the Treasury received requests worth Rs. 17.29 billion asking for letters to be issued to them, which could then be used to obtain concessionary loans from banks, a Treasury official told    The Sunday Morning Business    on 16 July. According to him, by then they had already approved a number of requests that came through various ministries. 

 As of 16 July, the Treasury has received requests from four ministries and two departments – the Ministry of Roads and Highways; the Ministry of Urban Development, Water Supply, and Housing Facilities; the Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medical Services; the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development; the Department of Agriculture; and the Department of Sport Development.  

 Requests received from the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) had to be sent back to them by the Treasury due to several pieces of missing information, according to the Treasury. Nevertheless, the Treasury official told    The Sunday Morning Business    that the Treasury had approved 14 requests submitted by the Ministry of Roads and Highways, and the amount of outstanding payments to these 14 contractors/suppliers stands at Rs. 54.7 million. 

 Further, two requests from the Ministry of Fisheries, amounting to Rs. 122 million, were said to be approved by 17 July. The total number of requests received through this ministry at that point was 6,724. 

 Outstanding payments from the Government to the construction sector were supposed to be settled before the presidential election in November last year. Nevertheless, since the payments were not made last year, the Government has decided to provide this facility for six months, within which period the Treasury is expected to settle pending payments to the respective companies. Therefore, they can settle the loan they obtained under this facility. 

 Even though the ongoing pandemic has worsened their struggles, the construction sector’s financial struggles date back to 2018 due to a large number of unpaid bills by the Government to contractors. These issues were exacerbated by the October crisis in 2018 and the Easter Sunday incidents last year that drove away foreign direct investment (FDI), according to industry stakeholders.

,,Maliban the first to source ginger 100% locally,business," By Uwin Lugoda 

 Maliban has become the first biscuit manufacturer in Sri Lanka to source 100% of their ginger from local farmers for their “Inguru Biscuit” brand, according to the company.

 Speaking to    The Sunday Morning Business   , Maliban Biscuit Manufactories (Pvt.) Ltd. General Manager – Operations Bandula Perera stated that the company first made the decision to source their ginger locally in 2019, and began the initiative during the same year. However, they only started sourcing 100% of the spice from local farmers last May. 

 “Inguru Biscuit is one of our best performing products and our customers love the taste, which only comes from the finest ginger. Due to this, we decided to source it locally and train our local farmers to harvest only the best-quality ginger.” 

 Maliban produces 14 million packs of Inguru Biscuit per year and requires up to five tonnes of ginger per month. Perera stated that earlier the company used to import their ginger from countries such as India and China, which was not ideal. Now they source their ginger from 25 farming families based in the areas of Muddaragama, Divulapitiya, Palawela, Midigama, and Naranwala. 

 This new initiative is handled by Maliban’s dairy and agri products arm, Maliban Dairy and Agri Products (Pvt.) Ltd., which also trains these farmers in the best seed selection, pre-cultivation, and post-cultivation methods, through their experienced field teams who supervise the farmers. 

 Perera explained that achieving the goal of sourcing their ginger 100% locally came easy to Maliban due to its already existing farmer base of 3,000 farmers, harvesting a variety of crops in a land area of 3,000 acres. The company also sources their corn, green gram, and even soy locally for their cereal product “Yaha Posha”. 

 Moreover, the company began its own mango plantation in 2018 and more recently started farming pepper on a small scale, with plans of eventually expanding it into areas such as Kolonnawa, Godakawela, and Embilipitiya. 

 In general, Sri Lanka’s ginger cultivation is spread across the country, with wet and intermediate zones being the main growth areas. The total land extent used for cultivation in 2019 was estimated to be 1,838 hectares, in districts such as Kurunegala, Kandy, Gampaha, Colombo, and Kegalle, with the total production being 13,785 metric tonnes, according to the Department of Export Agriculture.

,,International community keeps a close watch,news,"The international community was keeping a close watch on the developments taking place in Sri Lanka.

,,Tourism visa to be extended : SLTDA requests six-month validity,business," By The Sunday Morning Business Desk  

 A proposal has been made by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) to increase the validity period of tourist visas to six months from the current period of one month, according to the SLTDA.  

 The proposal has been submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers and is likely to be taken up this week, SLTDA Chairperson Kimarli Fernando told    The Sunday Morning Business    last week.  

“Normally you have to pay $ 35 to get a one-month visa and pay again for an extension, which is a hassle. So I have suggested charging a one-time fee of $ 35 for a six-month visa,” Fernando added. 

 The extension has been proposed due to lengthy quarantine procedures tourists have to adhere to as per Ministry of Health guidelines when they visit the country and also to encourage tourists to stay for a longer period, according to Fernando.  

 She stated that the international travellers who arrive in Sri Lanka after the country eventually opens for tourism will be required to go through a compulsory 14-day quarantine period at selected hotels according to the Ministry of Health guidelines. 

 After completing the initial 14 day period, tourists can be moved to another set of selected hotels, where they get to visit designated tourist hotspots during specified hours while undergoing the second 14-day quarantine period. As the quarantine process alone takes 28 days, the SLTDA believes a visa valid for just one month would not suffice.  

 Further, when a visa is extended to six months for the same cost of that of one month, it is believed that tourists tend to stay for a longer period, increasing the tourism revenue for Sri Lanka.  

 According to the Department of Immigration and Emigration, prior to the lockdown, tourists were granted a 30-day visa. A person who applies for a short-term visit visa must obtain Electronic Travel Authorisation (eTA) before entering the country.  

 Every bonafide tourist who enters Sri Lanka within the period of the landing permit granted by the immigration officials can apply for a visa extension before the expiry of the visa. The short visit visa may be extended up to 90 days from the date of arrival at the first instance and a further 90 days at the second instance. 

 A Sri Lankan tourist visa with double entry up to 30 days, single entry up to 90 days, and double entry up to 90 days costs $ 20 for countries in the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC) and $ 35 for all other countries. 

 The country’s tourism came to a standstill after the closure of the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in March, following the local outbreak of the Covid-19 virus. Nevertheless, following the lifting of the seven-week lockdown imposed by the Government to control the local spread of the virus, domestic tourism began to pick up bringing the occupancy rates of hotels to 20% until the recent “second wave” of the virus, which began on 4 October with the detection of the Minuwangoda cluster.

,,Why CSR is being phased out for greater 'impact',business," By Uwin Lugoda 

 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been a part of Sri Lanka’s corporate culture for decades, achieving formal prominence, particularly over the past 10 or 20 years. It has set an example on how businesses can create shared value for society while operating responsibly. However, traditional CSR alone does not seem to be effective in today’s context, according to Lanka Impact Investing Network Director and entrepreneur Dr. Nirmal De Silva. 

 During an online media briefing held on 15 October titled “Take an action, make an impact” by Together In Action (TIA) to discuss how we can come together to take real action towards the global sustainability goals, Dr. De Silva promoted the idea of impact investing. TIA’s goal is to identify, support, and scale the most impactful social enterprises from around the world by connecting them with the best innovators with major organisations and impact investors, to bring about real and lasting change. 

 The concept refers to investments made by companies, organisations, and funds with the intention of generating a measurable and beneficial social or environmental impact alongside a financial return. 

 He explained that most organisations and entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka, either through guilt or by following the global trend, are now focusing on social impact as a key goal. He stated that the era of traditional CSR died a few years ago, and now the way forward is to create a positive impact. 

 “If you look at the current CSR most local companies do, they spend a million on advertising the project, another million printing t-shirts and other merchandise, and another million creating an event around it and taking bus loads of staff to rural villages. But the only impact they really have is giving Rs. 200,000 worth of school books to a few schools. This was just a façade companies used to put forth to feel good, but now is the era of impact.” 

 Dr. De Silva stated that irrespective of how companies and entrepreneurs choose to define or measure their social impact, it is something they should all focus on. He explained that the Lanka Impact Investing Network has already carried out some initiatives to create a good social entrepreneurship ecosystem, and are working to identify rural-level ideas which can be used to solve community-related problems. 

 “Social entrepreneurs and companies are not against making money. They need to make money for sustainability, but their priority is to create a positive impact on their communities. We have not only been able to create a silent economic revolution, but we have also empowered more entrepreneurs to join this framework.” 

 He said that in Sri Lanka he has seen the positive disruption of the healthcare industry, access to education, access to clean drinking water, and solutions to the plastic problem, stemming from grassroot-level entrepreneurs who were trying to solve community problems. However, these entrepreneurs are often overlooked and are given very little support in the form of financial capital, he added. 

 According to Dr. De Silva, the biggest hurdle these entrepreneurs face is not having any mentors or veterans to guide them into the next stage of the process. He explained that this is why they need initiatives like TIA to help these social entrepreneurs to really solve these community problems. 

 He stated that as entrepreneurs, their job is to find a solution for these problems in an innovative way that challenges conventional norms and creates a lasting impact. He explained that once they do this in a transparent manner, many more corporations and entrepreneurs will jump on the social impact bandwagon. 

 “We should remember that we are here for a short time and that what we are leaving behind is the impact we create on society and not the success we achieve.”

,,"Economic reforms before constitutional reforms, please",business,"Kumar Sangakkara in his famous Colin Cowdrey Lecture at London’s hallowed Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 2011 said: “In cricket, timing is everything.” Not only in cricket but in economics and politics too, timing is everything. 

Unfortunately, Sri Lanka’s track record on “economic reforms” has been very poor and completely devoid of timing. We have been completely ignorant of the need for economic reform and things are now at a dire stage. Across the board, even the Government has conceded that things are not easy! 

 Sri Lanka is experiencing a second wave of Covid-19 and the continued imposition of curfew in parts of an important district such Gampaha, which is a key economic centre, is a cause for concern. The recent lockdowns also cover a free trade zone, the country’s main international airport, and many export-oriented factories. Hence, one cannot simply ignore the economic impact of this health crisis. 

The Sinhala, Tamil and English versions of Sri Lanka's Constitution

 Our economy contracted by 1.6% in the first quarter of 2019 and the second quarter data is yet to be released. On the positive side, our exports have exceeded the $ 1 billion mark in September and our remittances have increased by 28% YoY (year-on-year). While this increase in remittances is a good sign, this sudden increase may be due to workers sending home their final savings due to job losses. Another positive sign is that our stock market is performing well with about Rs. 5 billion turnover with more than 41,000 transactions, the highest since 2011. However, on the other hand, following Moody’s credit rating downgrade and even prior to that, the departure of foreign investors from the stock market can be observed, and our treasury bills have been undersubscribed as of late. 

 Unfortunately, with Covid-19 infections picking up again, it is unlikely that people will see further relief measures from the Government, as the Government’s finances are in a complicated situation; in fact, they are probably worse off than our household finances. Reopening the country for tourism will most likely be postponed, at least until the end of the first quarter of next year, and further moratoriums or government handouts may be unlikely, given that the budget deficit for 2021 is expected to be around 9% of GDP. 

 In this context, we have to admit that our economy cannot be fixed just by incremental reforms. Superficial changes or stopgap solutions will not help us reach where we aspire to be. 

 Unfortunately what we are seeing at the moment are attempts to micromanage what is essentially a macroeconomic problem, while serious core economic concerns are reaching a boiling point. Measures such as the reduction of tariff lines on a few consumable goods and allowing the importation of some ingredients for the production of incense sticks are just a couple of examples of ad hoc micromanagement of the macro economy. When a senior minister has to engage himself in a micro task such as creating a tiny tariff reduction on just one HS (Harmonised System) code, it prevents them from prioritising the broader issues to navigate the economy at a time where the country is facing the unprecedented crisis of Covid-19. 

 A similar situation was reported to have occurred during the 1970s where the Minister of Finance had to go through a file every morning to evaluate the licence requests for the importation of motor vehicles. When a Finance Minister has to sit and supervise such a micro issue, it is obvious that many other policy priorities will be either ignored or mismanaged. 

 The World Bank predicted an economic contraction of about 6.7% for 2020 even before the emergence of the new wave of Covid infections, but mainstream conversation has been focused on constitutional reforms, particularly the 20th Amendment. It is true that people have provided a clear mandate for a new constitution, but our policymakers have to think of the timing of the new constitution and other constitutional reforms. The country and people’s needs and expectations have shifted, especially as the entire world is grappling with a pandemic. New needs and lifestyles have been created. Consumer and citizen behaviour and priorities have undergone a massive transformation. This doesn't mean that the mandate for a new constitution is no longer valid, but the timing and focus being given to a new constitution has to be reconsidered. This matter could just as easily be taken up whenever the current crisis has been dealt with. 

 There is no doubt that our constitution is far from our expectations, but the brewing economic crisis (not just in Sri Lanka but across the world) requires 100 times greater focus for the economy to be put back on the right track. 

 The previous Government too was spending its energy on a new constitution without focusing on much-needed economic reforms. After spending significant time and resources during its tenure on a proposed constitution, it was ultimately not even presented to Parliament. Much-needed economic reforms were postponed and we ended up with 2.3% economic growth with stagnation in exports and foreign direct investments. 

 It is a political reality that there is a trade-off between constitutional reform and economic reform. Ultimately, for both constitutional reforms and economic reforms, one needs to sacrifice some political capital as, naturally, there is opposition to any type of reform. It all comes down to prioritising what reforms are urgent considering the internal and external environments. 

 Serious legal reforms can be carried out to positively affect businesses and the business climate before these planned constitutional reforms. As I have highlighted before in this column, Sri Lanka’s land regulations, regulations on micro and small enterprises, and employment regulations can be easily reformed to bring faster results. Age-old laws, regulations, and bureaucratic practices continue to hamper investment. Therefore, instead of a heavily energy-consuming constitutional reform process, we can focus on getting our economic fundamentals right. Creating competition and competitiveness is the way to go. 

 Over the years, while we have been discussing constitutional reforms, our regional peers have moved ahead of us, especially on the economic front. For example, Vietnam increased its exports from $ 50 billion to $ 250 billion from 2008 to 2018, while Sri Lanka’s performance improved only from $ 7.5 billion to $ 10 billion in the same period. 

 National Budget 2021 

 Now the Government has a golden opportunity to bring in a series of economic reforms through the upcoming national budget. A clear direction through serious reforms will bring back credibility to the Government and the economy, and send a positive signal to investors locally and globally. Sri Lanka’s economic problems have gone far beyond ad hoc fixing. Now it can only be fixed through macro reforms. 

 Then comes the question of what sort of reforms. In the world of business and economics, it is incentives that drive growth and innovation. It is by expanding markets and access to markets that growth can be achieved. It is through competition and by creating a level playing field that growing economies, including our regional peers, have achieved growth. So, for a market of 21 million people, our reforms have to be based on setting up proper incentives, connecting with other markets, and improving productivity for those who work hard and value free exchange of goods and services. 

 Bringing in these macro changes before micromanagement has to be at the forefront of government policy. Unfortunately we have no other alternative if we are serious about creating a prosperous country. Let's hope that Sri Lanka will get its timing right at least this time and establish the right fundamentals for a competitive economy.

,,Not trash but treasure : National plastic recycling effort required,business,"  By Ashan Weerakoon and Nilani Priyangika

 Our Earth can’t keep up with us. According to the Global Footprint Network, it takes one year and eight months for the Earth to produce what we consume in one year. We truly have to look beyond the take-make-waste model, and this includes looking even more closely at one of the world’s most controversial materials – plastic.      

 Not all plastics are recyclable. However, Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), easily identified by the number “1” placed inside the recycling symbol, is the most recycled plastic in the world and according to research conducted by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), PET amounts to more than 57% of the global recycled plastic market. The growing importance placed on the contribution of PET to the economy is further emphasised by the fact that the market for recycled PET is anticipated to be worth approximately $ 66.9 billion by the end of 2025 (CSIRO, 2017).  

 PET, a 100% recyclable material, holds multiple advantages over single-use plastic (non-recyclable). For instance, PET does not contain BPA (bisphenol-A), an industrial chemical that is used to make certain types of single-use plastics. On the contrary, PET is an inert polymer, which makes it a safe and ideal material to be used in packaging; “safe” and “ideal” because the contents within the PET packaging will not be exposed to external elements, and PET does not contain any adverse industrial-grade chemicals known to cause health concerns. Moreover, the manufacturing processes of PET are evolving, with a 1.5 litre PET bottle weighing 30% less than what it used to weigh five years ago.  

 PET is highly resistant, lightweight, and can be recycled several times to manufacture personal care products, clothing fibres, home utensils, construction materials, and even industrial strapping.  In Sri Lanka, a majority of recycled PET is currently exported as polymer grains, chips, and pellets that are used in the manufacturing of other products – namely recycled PET (rPET) products. Recycled PET pellets are produced into clothing fibres, clothing accessories, sportswear, brooms, and brushes and are even used in the manufacture of high-street fashion.  

    While PET can be a valuable resource for the packaging and apparel industry, it can also play an important role in offsetting the ecological footprint left by single-use materials. The footprint of recycling PET is smaller than that of extracting single-use natural materials, which have a sizeable demand on arable land, clean water, fertilisers, and regeneration time. Recycling PET also has a considerably smaller carbon footprint as it takes less crude oil to recycle a used PET product.   

 Trash is treasure; the story of a PET collector  

 We at Shanthi Sustainable Development provide complete solutions in waste management to businesses and local communities across Sri Lanka. With a small yet dynamic team of five members, our Environmental Consultant and two other collectors, we collect approximately 60,000 PET bottles every month. We began operations in November 2019, and even though we have been up and running for less than a year, for us, trash is treasure, and at the core of our business is our responsibility to the environment. Our work takes us to different parts of the country where we work with local non-governmental organisations (NGOs), voluntary groups, local government authorities, municipal councils, businesses, and communities to create and support sustainable mechanisms towards better waste management. 

We also work with individual community collectors such as your neighbourhood “bothal paththara”   collectors, to collect all waste items created from households. Once the used PET has been collected from different locations, i.e. from beach clean-ups, collection bins, the local “parisara pola”, municipal council waste, and local businesses, we transport this non-biodegradable waste to our warehouses to wash and sort through the collected material before taking it to the recycler, Eco Spindles (Pvt.) Ltd.  

 The lifecycle of a PET product is continuously evolving and changes hands from a manufacturer, to consumers, to collectors, to recyclers, and then goes back into the market as a new product altogether. PET not only creates an expansive value chain, it also provides livelihood opportunities for many individuals and businesses down the line. Knowing this, it is our responsibility to champion collection and recycling within local communities with the hope of empowering individuals to build their own business around waste management. Ultimately, Sri Lanka can also take on the role of being a regional hub for PET management and recycling.  

 PET is not the issue, irresponsible recycling is  

 Despite the media attention, awareness campaigns, and efforts by municipal councils across the country, the general public remains unaware about the recycling properties of PET, and more importantly, how far a PET product can go if disposed of and recycled correctly. According to the Journal of Research Technology and Engineering of the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Jayewardenepura (2020), the Western Province alone generates around 3,500 metric tonnes (MT) of solid waste every day, of which 2,400 MT is collected. Of this, close to 15% becomes compost, 10% is recycled, and 75% is thrown into open dumps. As of now, only 20-25% of Sri Lanka’s PET is being collected for recycling. The rest is being burnt, ends up in landfills, and ultimately in our waterways. This system needs to change.  

For a truly circular economy to come into existence, we believe that there should be a coming together of collectors, recyclers, PET manufacturers, importers, brand owners, manufacturers of rPET products, environmental authorities, the State, and the informal sector that engages in waste collection. With a few common forums and no structured alliance, this disconnect amongst these different entities has caused a prolonged and somewhat disrupted recycling system.  

For example, let’s look at our very own business model. Shanthi Sustainable Development first began operations within Wennappuwa and Kalpitiya. Together with the local authorities, we were able to help Chilaw hold the city’s first-ever “parisara pola” recently, to raise awareness of proper waste separation and segregation, so that the community will be able to create an income supplementation with their recyclable household waste.  

 Close to a year into operations and after having met different kinds of consumers from the eco-conscious to ones who believe climate change is a farce, one thing is clear – education and awareness around separation, segregation, and responsible recycling should be a national priority. The issue is beyond the consumption of PET. We should actively pursue the creation of a network to support the many individuals involved in the process of waste collection, segregation, and recycling. Businesses like ours not only contribute towards the attempt to solve the trash problem in Sri Lanka, they also provide jobs and create an entire ecosystem that contributes towards community development. Our way of doing things is reaching its limits. It is time to disrupt the system and think circularly.

""We have done a draft which is currently being reviewed by the health authorities, and when they give the green light, I can open it up for the local insurance companies to bid. But this is not about making a profit, we are only covering the cost"" SLTDA Chairperson Kimarli Fernando

 This new wave of Covid-19 seemingly making its way through Sri Lanka has highlighted the importance of information in controlling the spread of the pandemic, which will be accentuated once the country reopens for international tourists. 

 To address this, Sri Lanka Tourism announced the launch of a comprehensive travel app “Visit Sri Lanka”, with the aid of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA), last June. 

 Following this announcement, Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) Chairperson Kimarli Fernando stated that as of August, Version Zero (V0) of the app was ready and awaiting authorisation from the Immigration and Emigration Department to be linked with the online visa process. 

 Speaking to    The Sunday Morning Business   , she explained that the app would be an extension of the online immigration form, where it will include more information relevant to the present situation. Currently the online immigration forms only require basic information, such as the date of the flight, etc., but Covid has made it paramount that more information be shared by the tourists to control the spread. 

 ""We will put the app link on the online form, where tourists coming into Sri Lanka can download it. They will be required to enter information on when they will be arriving and the Level One and Two hotels they will be staying at, which they can book and pay for via the app."" 

 As per the regulations released by the local health authorities, any tourist entering the country will have designated hotels they need to stay in at different stages of their visit. 

 The first level is a limited list of hotels where the tourist will stay for 14 days, with a PCR test being conducted between the fifth and 11th day, and they will not be allowed to leave the hotel. Once they do a final PCR test on the 14th day, they will be sent to a Level Two hotel – this stage has a wider selection – where the tourists will stay for 28 days, only being allowed to go to designated tourist destinations at particular times. 

 ""Due to these requirements, tourists have to stay in the country for a minimum of 14 days. This is because even if they tested negative 72 hours before the flight, there are cases where they could test positive on the ninth day."" 

 The app also required information from the tourists on whether they are travelling to Sri Lanka with a local passport holder. Fernando stated that this was a new requirement that was rolled out due to them seeing a surge in inquiries where many of the tourists have personal connections to the country; where they either have a spouse that is Sri Lankan or owns a local business. 

 She explained that in these cases, the app also requests information as to what that relationship is, with options such as wife, husband, mother, father, child, and other being available. After this, the app requires the tourist to fill out their name, local passport number, and passport expiry date. 

 In order to avoid any confusion, Fernando stated that they have included a clause in the app, stating it is mandatory to provide the required information, and pay for both the three PCR tests and Covid-19 insurance, which is for the medical facilities related to Covid-19. 

 She stated that as of now, the prices for the PCR tests range from Rs. 7,500 to Rs. 11,000, and the Covid insurance they are looking at is a Rs. 5 million cover. She explained that the reason for this is that, in a worst-case scenario, a tourist who tests positive may need intensive care for 30 days, which would cost around Rs. 100,000 a day, and they will also incur other costs related to medical services. 

 ""We have done a draft which is currently being reviewed by the health authorities, and when they give the green light, I can open it up for the local insurance companies to bid. But this is not about making a profit, we are only covering the cost,” Fernando said. 

 Once all the payments are made and questions answered, the app will produce a reference number which needs to be entered in the immigration form to start the visa process. 

 Fernando stated that visa approval should take around a day or two, after which the app will also automatically notify the health officials in the 25 districts via email. 

 ""For example, if the tourists pick a Level One hotel in Hambantota and a Level Two hotel in Habarana, once the visa process is done, we will immediately inform the health authorities in those areas so that they stay informed. Then our duty as the Tourism Board is done. Right now, information is key.” 

   

 Version One 

 While V0 of the app is set to focus on Covid-related information and features, Fernando stated that the next version of the app, Version One (V1), is set to have a multitude of data and features which are aimed at enhancing Sri Lanka's tourism experience. She also added that funding for V1 would come from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and World Bank. 

 Its features include the ability to buy tickets for government-run tourist destinations such as Sigiriya, access to maps, registered hotels, sports centres, tour guides, and it will even host a platform to rate each tour guide. 

 Fernando stated that while Sri Lanka Tourism currently trains tour guides and registers them, they have no feedback on whether or not the guides are any good. The app is set to allow people to rate the guides, thereby providing Sri Lanka Tourism with data on any gaps in the training that need to be addressed. It will also promote the guides with the best ratings based on customer feedback, and list the specialities of each guide with regard to language, region, and activities. 

 However, she stated that the app will only allow people to book tickets from government-registered tourist spots. It will not facilitate the booking of any hotels or guides, instead limiting itself to providing information on them. 

 Significantly, the app will showcase 4,596 newly identified locations for camping and cycling. It has also received data from the Ministry of Buddhasasana, Cultural and Religious Affairs to give tourists the locations of all the temples in Sri Lanka. 

 ""This is not just for hotels and restaurants. If a tourist wants to visit one particular temple or all the temples in one district, they can use the app."" 

 The app will also host an emergency button to connect the tourists with the nearest police stations if the need arises, and share their location with the authorities. Moreover, it will also have a complaint portal, where tourists can complain to the Tourist Board about anything – from hotels with poor service to invasive “beach boys”. 

 ""We can share these complaint statistics with the media and stakeholders so that we know what kind of danger each district poses. Right now, tourists go directly to social media, which paints a bad picture of Sri Lanka, so we cannot continue to let that happen. We need to be able to respond to all these complaints directly."" 

 The app will also provide surveys for tourists to fill on their experience in Sri Lanka. As an incentive for filling out the survey, tourists will be given a small gift at the departure lounge of the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA), such as a free cup of tea. Fernando stated that pre-Covid these surveys were done manually by airport staff who approach tourists when they are departing Sri Lanka and noted that this was an inefficient technique. 

 Fernando plans to share data gathered through the app with stakeholders, making it easier for them to pitch Sri Lanka as the perfect tourist destination to each international market while targeting their specific interests. 

 Fernando stated that this app is drawing inspiration from similar apps in tourism hotspots such as Singapore, Australia, and Dubai, with the biggest gamechanger being the ability to book all tickets on a single platform. 

 This next version of the app will receive funding from the World Bank for its technical side, which is mainly the IT architecture, while the ADB will fund the data collection efforts for the app.

A statement by the Army media unit said that in response to a request made by the United Nations, the Sri Lanka Army had decided to recall Lieutenant Colonel Kalana Amunupura, the Contingent Commander of the Sri Lankan Combat Convoy Company in Mali. The Army said that the appointment of the officer was agreed on by the UN itself, after the Sri Lanka Army forwarded the names of four nominees in the year 2016, before the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka was entrusted the task of vetting service personnel, bound for UN assignments in December, 2017 as advised by the UN. “In fact, the UN at that stage cleared Lieutenant Colonel Kalana Amunupura for the appointment of the Commander of Combat Convoy Company in Mali (MINUSMA) dropping all three other nominees,” the Army said. Therefore, the Sri Lanka Army said that the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka was not involved in recalling the said officer. The Army said last week that it is to recall the military officer stationed in Mali following a UN demand but will later appeal against the order. Following a review of the human rights background of the commander of the Sri Lankan contingent deployed to the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Mali, the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission in Mali has requested Sri Lanka to immediately repatriate him to Sri Lanka.

,,Transforming Colombo with smart street lighting,business," By The Colombo Municipal Council 

 Colombo City has been undergoing many changes during the last two decades. The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) has been at the forefront of making the city more liveable for both residents and visitors. The CMC on a daily basis serves approximately 1.3 million people including 800,000 residents. Considering that Colombo is an important city to all Sri Lankans, the CMC has, together with various partners, continually acted to facilitate the changes needed to modernise the city. As a result, Colombo is considered one of the cleanest and safest cities in South Asia in comparison to other major cities of the same size in the region. 

 The vision of the Mayor, Rosy Senanayake, is to transform Colombo into a smart green city. In line with this vision, the CMC continues its efforts to make Colombo a world-class city, and makes further plans to modernise it in the future. We aim to create a city that is resident and visitor-centred. 

 The CMC is happy to announce a partnership with Richardson Technologies to install energy-efficient smart LED street lighting throughout the city starting this year. The aim is to ensure efficient lighting by leveraging the latest technology and knowhow at no capital cost to the rate payer. The LED lights will be installed on street lamp poles along main and other roads in consultation with the CMC to address deficiencies in both lighting and reliability of the street lighting system itself. It will also ensure enhanced safety for vehicular and pedestrian traffic. 

 The time has come to move to more efficient, robust technology solutions that will enable better control of when the lights come on and off, will notify of maintenance issues, and other smart lighting features. City councils in Singapore and South Korea, for example, have already done so. It is estimated the city of Colombo will save 60% on energy cost per smart LED street light. 

 The CMC has entered a public-private partnership (PPP) for this project. This partnership requires the private entity to absorb capital costs in exchange for the ability to monetise over a period of time to recover their cost. In turn, the city gets modernised with efficient and safer services and royalties from any solution successfully rolled out by the partner within the confines of the PPP contract. It is important to note that the contract also allows Richardson the right to implement other technology offerings on the street lamp. 

 Colombo City has approximately 300 km of roads that the CMC provides lighting for. That is approximately 12,000 street lamps in Colombo  1 to 18. The CMC will be continually engaged with the public from time to time to update and disseminate more information about the nature of this project, the oversight duties of the CMC, information on the financial aspects, adherences to the framework of the contract, both in letter and spirit. 

 The CMC is confident that this project, known as the Smart City Lighting Project, will usher in a new dawn for Colombo and its people.

,,Delays within our Justice system : Reasons and Solutions,business," Almost anyone in Sri Lanka will have a story about their run-ins with our system of justice – about land cases that have dragged on for decades, victims waiting for years for justice, custody battles that outlast a kid’s childhood, about impoverished people languishing in jail unable to settle their paltry fines, etc.

 The New Minister of Justice assumed office with the promise of major reform, specifically addressing judicial delays. For years, our system of justice has faltered from inadequate numbers of judges and courts, complex and outdated laws, and politicisation and corruption. Today, despite a strong push to reach settlement in outstanding cases, hundreds of thousands cases remain pending, weighing down the entire judicial system. 

 The human cost of these delays is often ignored; it’s easier to turn a blind eye than to dwell in the plight of those awaiting justice. Families suffering while their breadwinner languishes in jail, unable to pay a fine; gentle men and women spend their twilight years embroiled in property disputes; children who have the joys of childhood robbed by custody battles. Each delay means a piling of legal fees and other expenses – a drain on resources for years as cases drag on unnecessarily. Where serious crimes are concerned, the lengthy delays mean that multiple judges preside over a case and the final verdict is delivered by a judge who has played no part in the related hearings. 

 A closer look at our severely overcrowded prisons alone would tell a tragic part of this story; nearly half of all prisoners are in there because of the non-payment of fines or their inability to post bail while awaiting trial. That many of them only received a fine means their crimes were never considered serious enough for imprisonment. Yet, the judicial system’s inability to address these critical shortcomings means our prisons remain overcrowded. 

 And then there is the urgent need to update and strengthen laws surrounding pressing issues of the day: Child abuse, sexual abuse, economic crime, narcotics, medical negligence, IT fraud, and privacy, to name a few. Justice must not only be delivered with efficiency and timeliness, it must also be delivered in the context of the times we live in. 

 The strong interdependence between the judicial systems and the economy means that the weaknesses of justice have a direct impact on or economic performance. These drawbacks are reflected in Sri Lanka’s low ranking in the Ease of Doing Business Index. A slow, inefficient and often archaic system does little to inspire business confidence and can be a turn-off for even the most earnest of foreign investors. Sri Lanka needs to urgently up its game on arbitration and contract enforcement if it is to fulfil its inward investment ambitions. 

 No one denies that our judicial system needs fixing. Leave aside the inherent issues of politicisation and corruption, the sheer inefficiency must be addressed forthwith. Clearing the backlog and the bottlenecks throughout the system certainly requires the addition of more judges and more courthouses. But that alone won’t put things right. Sri Lanka needs a simplification and modernisation of the entire framework that allows speedier passage of justice. Ultimately, it must be done in acknowledgment of efficient and timely justice as a human right.

,,"Shishyathwa: Not during Covid, not ever!",business," By Dr. Nicholas Ruwan Dias and Niresh Eliatamby 

 Last Sunday, hundreds of thousands of little children were put at risk by forcing them to sit for the Grade Five Scholarship Exam, during the middle of the worst outbreak in Sri Lanka of the deadliest pandemic to challenge mankind in more than a century. 

 A few days before that, a male teacher was arrested for sexually abusing four six-year-old girls, when their parents sent them for individual tuition classes for the same Scholarship Exam that they would sit in four years’ time. 

 Meanwhile, employers throughout Sri Lanka have been lamenting for decades that graduates and Advanced Level (A/L) and Ordinary Level (O/L)-qualified young persons possess few skills for employment. 

 Private and state sector vocational training institutes are filled with hundreds of thousands of youngsters who learnt little in school, despite having good A/L and O/L results. Thus, large numbers of Sri Lankan youth spend their most productive years outside the job market. 

 The present Sri Lankan educational system, which is focused on A/L and O/L, does not allow children to think and unleash their potential to build up their own future in an innovative, systemic way. 

 We have an illusion that our kids are advanced in emerging technologies, but their knowledge is more often just imaged on past papers and they know little of technology. 

 The extraordinary operation of sending children for an exam during Covid underlined the unhealthy attitude towards education in this country, where success in non-innovative exams are deemed to be the yardstick of academic success, despite much of the world moving away from such an antiquated system. Although there was significant grumbling about the holding of the “Shishyathwa” and other exams, many parents nonetheless felt that they had little choice but to put lives at risk and have children take their exams. 

 Parrot education 

 Sri Lanka’s current method of education fails children by teaching them as one teaches parrots, not realising that the education system does not inspire or motivate children to think, reason, and activate their capacity for shaping their future. 

 Sri Lankan teens are taught to learn the parrot way for their O/L and A/L exams, which was once considered a ""gold standard"" for intelligence testing. School teachers and tuition gurus are using marking schemes published on examination boards' past papers to prepare children in order to be able to replicate answers without understanding subjects in detail. 

 Background 

 The education sector in Sri Lanka has grown rapidly over the past decade, but the standard of learning remains unimaginative and misguided. Quality education is more critical than ever in an increasingly knowledge-based world economy. Education must be aimed at encouraging and building children. The call for increased investment in education has been growing since independence, but the issue of its education policy continues to be addressed by an independent Sri Lanka even over six decades after. Distorted national goals in this critical sector indicate low levels of learning. 

 Sri Lanka does not promote innovative thinking by emphasising rote learning and its strict evaluation system. There are flaws in the rote teaching approach. Research has found that the mathematics, science, and reading abilities of primary and secondary school students have regressed. It has not only long-term consequences, but is an institutionalised procedure as a detrimental rote method. The students, who read, mingle with people, and experience society, culture, and places in which they move, become well rounded. These all form their views and experiences on their educational journey. The less they experience, the less they explore and the more closed their minds remain. 

 Tuition masters’ “tuition kada”  

 Mass classes of over 1,000 students are quite normal in cities and large towns across the country. Nugegoda, Gampaha, Kurunegala, Anuradhapura, and many other towns are known as “tuition towns” with students from many miles around flooding in for classes on Saturdays and Sundays. 

 Even during Covid, tuition masters petitioned the Government to allow them to go back to these huge mass classes, and obtained a concession to have 50% capacity classes of 500 students! 

 These tuition classes conducted for students of as early as Year 1, continue until A/L, and are an enormous financial drain for almost all parents. 

 Poor grading system 

 The grading system employed in Scholarship, O/L, and A/L exams simply rewards the vomiting out of answers crammed into students’ heads, for the most part. There is little scope allowed for creativity. This has led to Sri Lanka becoming a non-competitive nation globally. 

 The way forward: Practical solutions 
 
           Replace the Scholarship, O/L, and A/L system with a credits-per-course-based system, where children are encouraged to continuously learn, as opposed to cramming and parroting  
           Such a system should include a diverse range of subjects up to the end of their schooling, including a wide choice of electives, to enable them to explore different areas and find what they are each talented to pursue  
           Replace the current O/L and A/L Z-score system of entry into universities and government jobs with a points system that recognises and rewards sports and extracurricular activities  
           Build a better society by giving additional points for activities that benefit society – social service, scouting, innovations, etc.  
           By giving points for sports, build a healthier and more competitive society  
           Outlaw mass tuition classes. Make teachers provide extra coaching for students of their own schools in the afternoons after regular school hours  
           Change the school hours to allow children to come to school by 8.30 a.m. and stay in school until 5.30 p.m., with the last two hours being for sports or extracurricular activities, or extra classes. That would allow parents to pick children up from school after work  
           Stop trying to reinvent the wheel, as Sri Lanka often tries to do and fails. Look at global best practices in education in countries that are leading the world in innovation, economic growth, science and technology, etc.  
 
 The Scholarship and O/L exams 

 Of course, the Scholarship Exam and O/L serve one good purpose, in that they provide an opportunity for students in rural areas to enter the big schools. However, it is not the opportunity that must be reconsidered, but the manner in which the evaluative exercise is conducted through regurgitative exams. It would be far better to use different criteria for selection as outlined above. 

 The global scenario: Key highlights 
 
           In all international student assessment programmes, Finland was a frontrunner  
           Sri Lanka is not examined under Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and is thus unsure of its student standards   
 
   

 Every three years in the world, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) analyses education systems, measuring the skills and knowledge of children aged 15 (and collaboratively to address challenges and financial learning) in science, reading, and mathematics. The PISA exam is conducted in 79 countries with 600,000 students, based on a two-hour test.  

 The PISA 2018: Top-rated countries 

 Figure 1 shows the top PISA ratings globally for the countries with the best education systems. 

 Primary education quality across the 2017/2018 country index 

 Figure 2 shows the ratings for primary education. 

 With an index score of 6.7, Finland had the world's highest elementary school rating in 2017. The index is one (low quality) to seven (very good). Switzerland, Singapore, the Netherlands, and Estonia have placed in the top five as the countries with the highest primary education standards. The first stage of formal formation involves basic knowledge and skills, such as math, reading, writing, and science, which have extraordinarily high student attendance rates in advanced economies. This allows young students to build a strong basis in education. 

 Finland 

 The principle of play-based learning is part of Finland's early education system. Students are not obliged to attend school until they are six. When the child turns seven, they give basic education. They will pursue a single structural education for the next nine years. They take extra steps to review and revise the curriculum to fulfil the needs of each individual. To further strengthen teachers and classrooms, the Finnish National Education Agency supports self-evaluation. Finland also does not provide national standard assessments, but measures learning performance. Free meals are another striking feature. The high school is divided into two general and technical courses. 

   
 
           The school days are shorter (190 days a year)   
           The education system of Finland has certain basic values   
           Students can choose their educational direction  
 
 Finland consistently ranks among the world's education systems and is renowned for having no systems of banding. Students are taught in all classes, regardless of their skills. The difference between the poorest and the richest is also the lowest. Finnish schools have only one compulsory examination at the age of 16 as well as very little homework. 

 Students may select their schedules in general education, and they must eventually attend an admission test. These ratings are taken into account in the university applications. Training is based on work, while studying and apprenticeships go together. After that, students gain competence-based skills. High school is also totally open to higher education. Only books, transport, and other school supplies must be paid for by the students.  

 Denmark 

 Education remains one of the primary pillars of the Danish welfare state and has helped make the citizens and workers in Denmark relatively harmonious. The Danish education system seems reasonably cohesive, systematic, and comparable in international contrast. It is mainly state-funded and regulated. Schools are almost entirely governed by the State through the Ministry of Education, with recognition by the competent authorities in further education and higher education. However, under public oversight and financing, the education system involves a variety of private institutions and special interest groups or associations participating in the education system. 

 Singapore to replace GCE exams 

 In 2027, the Ministry of Education will implement a new common national examination, which will replace the existing GCE Ordinary Level (O/L) and Normal Level (N/L) exams, thus replacing the subject banding system which will further replace the secondary school streaming. The proposed subject-based banding system would also require a new high school programme. Each topic is divided into three different levels: General 1 (G1), which refers to Technical, General 2 (G2) is Academic, and General 3 (G3) is referred to as Express. Students may take topics at various levels, depending on their skills. All students in high school will sit in 2027 for a general national examination and will have a general certificate, a list of completed subjects, and the regular subject band. This is because subject-based banding is a more versatile course. 

 Teacher vs. technology 

 The Fourth Industrial Revolution is a crucial test to the education system that focuses on the recitation of facts and measurement of formats exactly where people cannot compete with intelligent machines. In all our technological development, human creativity and imagination remain unparalleled. We should take advantage of this and give our young people the ability to make the most of their advantages. 

 Research findings indicate that the teacher vs. technology technique has not been compatible with its hype and legitimate purpose. We must be cautious that technology alone may or may not revolutionise education. The most critical factor for the progress of the pupil will always remain teachers. Students must have the belief that they are interested in the future, a goal for which they should fight if they want to do well in school. Education should provide just the right amount of physical adventure and intellectual stimulation. Most successful are those methods that facilitate the treatment of teachers and students. The teaching and learning process is a voluntary act that cannot be replicated by machines and markets. 

 Soft skills 

 Soft skills are very important in this sense. When well taught, children can use soft skills to adapt to change faster, develop a deeper understanding of the world around them, and eventually advance to their selected area. Knowledge and skills can be technical, practical, easier to measure, and can enable a student to secure a job. But soft skills can allow them to adapt better and develop their careers. The fundamental fact is that physical, emotional, and social skills should be built and improved as a key to future prosperity and achievement. Soft skills are based on multiple experiences, interpersonal relationships, logical thinking and challenges, and the ability to create connections between complex ideas. 

 Conclusion 

 Sri Lanka is facing a national crisis in education, where our system has failed miserably – failed to provide our youngsters with a secure future and failed to provide the nation with a path to prosperity. We need to change the curricula and teaching practices all round, to focus less on rote or straightforward learning and more on the requisite skills, such as communication, reasoning, solving problems, critical thinking, and independence.

""From white collar employees to blue collar employees, women are some of the first to be impacted where tourism is concerned. For example, if you take something like housekeeping, the need for housekeepers depreciates when there are no guests coming into the hotels."" WIN Chairperson Dr. Sulochana Segera[/caption]

 Sharmila Rajapaksha is a mother of three who spent the last eight years as the sole breadwinner for her family, providing for them through her job as a receptionist at a prominent hotel in Ella. However, with the arrival of Covid-19 and the initial lockdown in March, the hotel closed its doors and let go of over 20 staff members, including Rajapaksha, leaving her without a source of income for almost eight months now. 

 As it turns out, Rajapaksha is just one among a large number of women who have suffered the same fate, according to recent statistics released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA), which showcased that women were disproportionately impacted by the current Covid-19 pandemic in Sri Lanka. 

 The assessment done by the two organisations stated that women made up 67% of those who lost their jobs during this period, in all segments of the tourism industry. This statistic represents both the formal and informal tourism sectors in Sri Lanka. 

 Women in Management (WIM), a private limited company dedicated to uniting Sri Lankan career and women entrepreneurs, Chairperson Dr. Sulochana Segera agreed with the assessment, and stated that the pandemic has heavily resulted in women in both the formal and informal sectors losing their jobs. 

 Speaking to The Sunday Morning Business, she explained that this was because women are some of the first to be impacted in the tourism industry as a result of the roles they play. 

 According to Dr. Segera, in the formal sector women mostly work in roles that range from admin, human resources, the front desk to housekeeping, all of which are pretty vulnerable to job losses due to external impacts. 

 “From white collar employees to blue collar employees, women are some of the first to be impacted where tourism is concerned. For example, if you take something like housekeeping, the need for housekeepers depreciates when there are no guests coming into the hotels.” 

 She stated that this is much worse in the informal sector, as the range of women in the sector of tourism is much broader than that of the formal sector. Outside of Colombo, many of the smaller restaurants and homestays are run by women entrepreneurs or employ women staff, who directly depend on the tourists coming into the country. 

 Dr. Segera explained that women in these segments are currently facing a lot of issues since most of them solely depended on international tourists, due to local tourists opting to go to four and five-star establishments. 

 “These particular businesses mainly target foreigners because locals do not like to stay in homestays or go and eat Sri Lankan food. We need to look at the big picture – people are only focusing on these four and five-star hotels, but they will survive; these smaller informal establishments will not.” 

 Moreover, she stated that there are smaller segments of women in the industry who are indirectly impacted as well, such as those who sell vegetables to both the formal and informal sector hotels and handcraft souvenirs for the shops. 

 Nelum De Silva, an informal sector female entrepreneur with a homestay in Galle, attested to this, stating that many of the homestays in the region have been closed indefinitely. She explained that many of these homestays are run by women as an extra source of income, while their husbands go to their nine-to-five jobs. 

 “Our primary target is foreigners; they come and stay with us on average for about three to seven days, eat our food, and we even act as tour guides sometimes. Since we are in one of Sri Lanka’s biggest tourist regions, we have always made a lot of money through it, but now we have not had any business for months.” 

 She stated that most of the homestay owners tried attracting the domestic market during the last few months, but was unsuccessful in doing so. 

 According to SLTDA Director General Dhammika Wijayasinghe, there are more women in the informal sector than the formal sector, with the latter only having a 4-5% female representation. She explained that in order to curb this impact on the women in both sectors, the UNDP and SLTDA, with financial assistance from Citi, are set to develop a livelihood support mechanism for female entrepreneurs, with a particular focus on women who are unable to access existing livelihood support services to revive their businesses. 

 The media statement by the UNDP stated that while the Government has made significant progress in initiating early relief measures to businesses, doing so for women in the informal tourism sector has proven to be a challenge. This is due to problems posed in the form of low wages, precarious working conditions, the absence of any social protection, and an increase in unpaid work and care burdens during the pandemic. 

 “Building resilient social protection systems that help informal sector workers to withstand shocks are a critical element of Covid-19 responses. Supporting female workers affected by the crisis is a key component to ensuring that no one is left behind in Sri Lanka’s socioeconomic recovery efforts. This is both direct relief and recovery, and the initiative will test new approaches to inform future social protection policy thinking,” said UNDP Resident Representative in Sri Lanka Robert Juhkam. 

 The programme will directly support 900 women selected from all nine provinces in Sri Lanka. The project initiatives will benefit at least 3,500 men and women indirectly throughout the country. This will be a grant and it will be a relief to the affected parties. 

 Tourism authorities in provincial councils have been asked to identify women engaged in the tourism sector and women who have already registered with the SLTDA who will also be considered for the selection. Selection of beneficiaries will be done by a panel and it will be a transparent process. Each selected beneficiary will get around Rs. 50,000 worth of assistance. 

 SLTDA Chairperson Kimarli Fernando stated that the selected women will receive business development services to enhance their skills for alternative livelihood development. A system will be established to follow up with grant recipients to support them to utilise the grant for developing a complementary livelihood with the support of the provincial tourism authorities. 

 ""Existing and potential female entrepreneurs will be further supported to obtain business registration with the SLTDA, enabling them access to livelihood support from the Government in the future."" 

 The project will engage provincial councils to identify women like Rajapaksha and De Silva, who have been impacted by the ongoing pandemic, in order  to sustain the efforts of the initiative. It's also in line with the UN (United Nations) framework for the immediate socioeconomic response to Covid-19 that calls on countries to build forward better.

 For months, Sri Lanka has been celebrated as a nation that succeeded in containing the spread of Covid-19, with authorities repeatedly assuring the public that there was no community spread in the country. However, in early October (4), this illusion was shattered, when a female employee of an apparel factory in Minuwangoda tested positive for Covid-19. Just over a week later, over 1,300 workers and their close contacts had tested positive, increasing the total number of cases in Sri Lanka to 4,752 as of 12 October 2020. It has been revealed that the outbreak is not limited to just one apparel factory as previously thought, with several workers from other factories also testing positive. This is the largest Covid-19 cluster in Sri Lanka so far, and the cases are steadily on the rise, with the Government scrambling to trace contacts and conduct testing.  

 With this latest outbreak, garment factory workers are at a higher risk of contracting the disease. Poor working conditions in the factories – where health guidelines have been ignored – and the employees’ close proximity to each other in factories and living quarters have been blamed for the outbreak. Meanwhile, there have been allegations that the factory employers forced the garment workers to report to work, despite falling ill. Worryingly, females make up around 78% of the apparel industry’s workforce in Sri Lanka, according to the Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka (IPS). This means that, currently, females face a greater threat of contracting Covid-19.  

 Furthermore, according to a Health Labour Market Analysis (2018) conducted by the Ministry of Health, Nutrition, and Indigenous Medicine of Sri Lanka and the World Health Organisation (WHO), in Sri Lanka, 62% of health and social work jobs are held by females; in addition, most nurses are female, over half the medical students are female, and around 70% of students enrolled in paramedical education are female. According to research by the Association of Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes, women make up almost 70% of the private health sector. All of this indicates that Sri Lanka’s health sector is made up of mostly females. Thus, in a medical crisis such as the current pandemic, there is not only a heavier burden on women, but they are at a greater risk of getting infected by the virus.  

 Considering these two factors, currently, the Covid-19 pandemic poses a direct threat to women in Sri Lanka.  

 Economic burden on women   

 Unfortunately, the direct threat of catching Covid-19 is not the only problem faced by women. Research has shown that women are affected more severely by the economic fallout of the pandemic than men. According to a report by UN Women (2020), women are more vulnerable to layoffs and loss of income, because women typically hold less secure jobs than men. The report also notes that, globally, the sectors that are hardest hit by the crisis are dominated by females. In these jobs, the pay is low and working conditions are dire.  

 Sri Lanka’s apparel industry – heavily populated by female garment workers – is a good example. Even before the sector was hit by this latest wave of Covid-19, the apparel industry was struggling due to a fall in demand as a result of the global economic crisis triggered by the pandemic. The Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF) estimated that the industry will lose close to 100,000 jobs. With the industry being so feminised, it means that job cuts will affect more women than men.   

 The problem is not just affecting the apparel industry. Another group who are heavily affected are domestic workers – another female-dominant sector. The report by UN Women shows that mobility restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the pandemic means that it is difficult for domestic workers to maintain their usual working arrangements. Moreover, employers have refused to pay wages to the domestic workers who were unable to report to work during the lockdown period. Globally, 740 million women work in the informal economy and their income fell by 60% during the first month of the pandemic. As the Centre for Poverty Analysis (CEPA) has shown, ""the bulk of Sri Lanka’s female workforce is in the informal sector working as domestic workers, commercial sex workers, caretakers, cleaners, entrepreneurs, estate workers, and small-scale business women"" – most of whom have experienced income losses.  

 In the case of Sri Lanka, the especially vulnerable are female domestic workers who are employed as migrant workers, chiefly in the Middle East. Thousands of workers were laid off and were sent back, many of whom were infected with the virus due to the dire situation in their countries of destination. Media reports showed that many of them were left stranded in makeshift camps until they could be repatriated to Sri Lanka. However, with the latest outbreak, the Government has temporarily halted the repatriation of all migrant workers, not just leaving them exposed to the risk of infection, but also without an income nor a way back home to safety.  

 Meanwhile, Sri Lanka’s already-low female labour force participation of around 35% is expected to worsen due to the pandemic. This means that more women have or are on the brink of losing their livelihoods and incomes.  

 Shadow pandemic  

 As if things are not bad enough for women, they are also victimised by the “shadow pandemic”. One of the most alarming indirect impacts of the current pandemic has been the dramatic increase in violence against women – especially during the lockdown periods.    BBC    reported of a 20% increase in domestic violence cases, globally, during the lockdown. According to the World Bank, ""forced coexistence, job loss, escalating stress, and anxiety about the future has led to increased household tension, which turned many partners into abusers and exacerbated existing abuse"". As they are unable to leave home, women cannot seek the help of friends and family; in most cases, they are also unable to seek legal or medical help, leaving them trapped with their abusers.  

 Like in many other countries around the world, in Sri Lanka too, there are many women for whom the home is not the safest place. Anecdotal evidence shows that lesbian and bisexual women are even more vulnerable to violence at home. This situation has only worsened with the pandemic, as mobility restrictions have meant that women are not able to access their safe spaces and seek the help they need.  

 While the health crisis continues to ravage the country, Sri Lanka cannot ignore the socioeconomic inequalities that are widened as a result of the Covid-19 situation. Unsurprisingly, women have received the shorter end of the stick and are more vulnerable to the lasting negative impacts of the pandemic. With its already poor track record when it comes to gender equality, the current pandemic has shown just how long of a road Sri Lanka has ahead of itself to empower and safeguard women's lives and livelihoods.

,,Economists warn SL about the ‘big debt wolf’,business," By Madhusha Thavapalakumar 

 The little girl in    Little Red Riding Hood    did not listen to her mum when she told the little girl to go straight to her grandma’s house and not stray from the path. She deviated from the designated path to enjoy being in the woods. We all know what happened next. There was a big bad wolf, and it ate the poor girl after gobbling up her grandma. 

 According to Harvard University Center for International Development Director of Growth Lab Prof. Ricardo Hausmann, Sri Lanka could be compared to the little girl and its large pile of debt which is the big bad wolf. 

 With a debt-to-GDP (gross domestic product) ratio of over 90%, unarguably Sri Lanka has long been a heavy borrower and will likely continue to be one in the years to come. The country has been reliant on foreign loans over the decades, mainly for its infrastructure development projects. In the past 15 years alone, Sri Lanka has borrowed over $ 34 billion from various international financial organisations and lending nations. 

 Sri Lanka’s mounting debt pile is vulnerable to external shocks, while in turn, the country’s economy as a whole is vulnerable to adverse shocks due to its large public debt and low external buffers, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). A report compiled by an independent group of local economists last year highlighted that Sri Lanka’s annual debt payment is $ 5 billion, higher than the tourism earnings of Sri Lanka in 2018. 

 While experts argue that the debt-to-GDP ratio could increase to 100% in three years and double in six years, the Ministry of Finance is of the view that the debt to GDP ratio could be brought down to 72% by 2022, while also standing firmly against several ratings from international rating agencies. 

 In this context, one might ask: Has the country underestimated the adverse effect of this debt pile to economics? Has the Sri Lankan Government not taken its massive pile of external debt seriously? Prof. Hausmann, speaking from his experience of witnessing a number of external debt crises of various countries, says that we should take external debts seriously. 

 This week,    The Sunday Morning Business    is taking a look at the takeaways from Prof. Hausmann’s discussion during a recent webinar on the topic of “How can we improve Sri Lanka’s debt sustainability?”, organised by Advocata Institute, an independent think tank in Colombo. 

 There is a ‘big bad wolf’ 

 According to Prof. Hausmann, Sri Lanka has been focusing merely on its debt-to-GDP ratio, disregarding or trivialising every other aspect of its debt. If the focus is only on debt-to-GDP ratio, then of course it is a ratio the country could be proud of, as it has a double-digit ratio, while Asia’s largest economies and even the world’s superpower has it in triple-digit-level ratios against the GDP. 

 “It is easy to come and say that the debt-to-GDP ratio in Sri Lanka is 86%, whereas it is 230% in Japan and 100% in the US,” Prof. Hausmann said. 

 He stated that the concept of the debt-to-GDP ratio is arbitrary and therefore does not provide any real meaning. Instead, he emphasised the importance of focusing on a country’s interest rate burden-to-tax revenue ratio. 

 Interest rate-to-GDP ratio should be the focus 

 Despite Japan having a debt-to-GDP ratio of 230%, as mentioned earlier, the country’s interest rate-to-GDP ratio is zero, which means Japan has to raise zero percentage of taxes to pay its external interest rates. 

 Nevertheless, in the case of Sri Lanka, why Prof. Hausmann believes we should not be proud of our debt-to-GDP ratio is because of the fact that that Sri Lanka’s debt-to-GDP ratio is 86%, and about 6% of GDP (tax revenue’s portion of GDP) has to be allocated for interest payments. 

 “Sri Lanka has one of the worst interest burden-to-tax revenue measures in the world,” he stated. 

 The question is how much of the tax revenue earned by the government has to be dedicated for debt servicing and interest payments before educating a child or providing healthcare for an elderly person. The answer is alarming and the debt is a serious problem. 

 Prof. Hausmann’s suggestion for Sri Lanka is to look at the interest rate burden-to- tax revenue ratio and make it more meaningful. However, once again, making it more meaningful too is a complicated process, given the fact that the country’s tax revenue contribution to its GDP is lower than that of most of its Asian counterparts. 

 Going back to the case of Japan, it has zero interest to pay, yet it raises 40% of its GDP in taxes whereas Sri Lanka, with a 6% interest rate, raises only 12% if it’s GDP through taxes. It is evident that out of this 12%, 6% – exactly half of the tax revenue – is being spent in the form of interest payment, or to put it precisely, servicing the large pile of debt. 

 “You probably have one of the largest debts measured this way in the world – that means you have a really serious debt problem. It is not theoretical. Once you start thinking about the interest rate as a burden-to-tax revenue ratio, you realise how things can go south,” Prof. Hausmann warned. 

 If not, the wolf will bite 

 When the government keeps paying half of its tax revenue in the form of interest rate while borrowing money from external lenders, the credibility of a country gets deteriorated. When more loans are taken to finance deficits, markets tend to judge that the borrowing country does not qualify for the money and, in fact, lenders might not be keen on countries that are going down on the economic scale. 

 As a result, the government might be in a position to borrow at higher interest rates which would be an added burden to the existing interest rate payments. Subsequently, the tax revenue will go down, economic activities would slow down, and the domestic banking system would become fragile. 

 “This interest rate burden-to-tax revenue ratio worsens even faster. The reason is because you are accumulating that to pay for your deficit and because you are rolling over the maturing debt at a higher interest rate. And you get into something we call ‘bad debt dynamics’. Eventually, the pain of servicing is too large and the country would stop servicing the debt. So the country is in a debt crisis,” he added. 

 Recalling the debt crisis that took place in Argentina and Ecuador, he warned that when a country enters into a debt crisis, the recovery is incredibly difficult as the particular country is excluded from access to finance, and even if the country managed to find a lending source, the negotiations will take forever. 

 The only option in such a scenario for Sri Lanka would be to depend on its domestic banking system, but as noted above, amidst a debt crisis, the domestic banking system too would be weak as investments would have been already taken out of the country when it was following the toxic trait of borrowing more and more. Resultant is that the crisis would get severe amidst the absence of both a local or external financing source. 

 “There is a big bad wolf. It does exist, it does happen, and it does bite. When it bites, it hurts a lot. Do not let yourself be bitten by the big bad wolf,” Prof. Hausmann added. 

 Borrowing more does not help but cause troubles 

 If the country is to borrow more during a pandemic because tourism is deadlocked, exports are facing troubles, and public sector resources are at a premium level, the lenders would want to know whether the country is qualified for the money they are lending. 

 When lenders turn down the request of the loan because of the poor-looking economic indicators and the country too does not want to borrow at higher interest rates, the country turns towards IMF, the lender of the last resort. In April this year, Sri Lanka made a request from the IMF for a Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI). Nevertheless, last month, both State Minister of Money, Capital Markets, and State Enterprise Reforms Ajith Nivard Cabraal and Treasury Secretary S.R. Attygalle said the IMF’s support is not desperately needed by the country at the moment. 

 However, Prof. Hausmann said that going to the IMF and negotiating a financial agreement itself signals the market that the country is not qualified to lend or invest money. Furthermore, markets do not want to know that the borrowing country has no limits to borrowing. 

 Rating agencies and their ability to foresee 

 In the case of Sri Lanka, there is pretty much no difference between the opinion of a rating agency and market participants, according to Prof. Hausmann. If the rating agencies are signalling that with these interest rates, Sri Lanka cannot access the market, it actually means the country cannot rollover the debt voluntarily. 

 “As a result, the country will have to hold onto maturing debt with no market access. Right now, you have reserves but you can see the path to dwindling of your reserves. But these reserves are used to paying for imports and not just debt servicing,” he added. 

 When reserves are dwindled and markets are not choosing the country to lend or invest money, the country heads towards a severe economic issue where even the rest of the reserves would be drained. If there is no external support, the time period that would be taken for the rest of the reserve would be faster than it used to be. 

 Prof. Hausmann firmly stated that distinction by rating agencies is really about what the market thinks about Sri Lanka, and not about whether the Ministry of Finance and the market believe in the credit rating agency or not. 

 On 28 September, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the Sri Lankan Government’s long-term foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings to Caa1 from B2 and changed the outlook to “Stable”. This concluded the review for downgrade initiated on 17 April 2020. 

 The decision to downgrade Sri Lanka's rating to Caa1 reflects Moody's assessment that the coronavirus-induced shock, which Moody's regard as a social risk, will significantly weaken Sri Lanka's already fragile funding and external positions. 

 “Heightened liquidity and external risks stem from Sri Lanka's limited secured funding sources to meet its material external debt service payments over the coming years, during which period market refinancing will remain vulnerable to shifts in investor sentiment. At the same time, fiscal and external pressures will continue to limit the scope for reforms to address longstanding credit vulnerabilities, denoting weakening institutions and governance, an important driver of today's rating action,” Moody’s stated. 

 Two days following the rating, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) issued a statement stating that Moody’s rating downgrade fails to recognise and do justice to the ground reality of the ongoing rapid economic recovery backed by vastly improved business confidence arising from the return of political and policy stability after a lapse of five years. 

 “Sri Lanka, like many of its peers in the emerging market group, experienced initial capital outflows, exchange rate depreciation, slowdown in activity, and pressure on government finances in response to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. But the swiftness with which decisions were taken following the landslide victory of the Government enabled Sri Lanka to move along a recovery path towards growth and stability,” the Central Bank noted. 

 Policy options available to Sri Lanka 

 To stimulate the country’s economy without widening the fiscal deficit further, Sri Lanka is in dire need of having a growth strategy that is compatible with fiscal consolidation, according to Prof. Hausmann. 

 “Exports and investments work for these circumstances. Increasing export increases supply response then money will circulate within Sri Lanka. What is very important is to have a strategy to vaccinate its population. This would be a major achievement if the country can do that because with the vaccinated population, tourism can come back rapidly hopefully,” he added. 

 In terms of investments and loans, if Sri Lanka is to attract investors and lenders, the economy of the country should be stable and should signal a positive picture of the country. 

 “The Government should signal that deficits are on a path to come down – then you will get the lower cost of funding which will stimulate the economy,” he stated. 

 Sri Lanka’s export basket, which has not gone through diversification for decades, needs to be diversified desperately as part of its growth strategy. With exports being amongst the top three foreign exchange earning sources of Sri Lanka, an undiversified basket is overshadowing the possible export options of the country.

,,Railways to punish ‘squatting’ employees,news,"By Sarah Hannan    

 Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) has identified that its own employees have been occupying Sri Lanka Railways Reserve land illegally for a number of years, and therefore plans to charge lease payments from them, according to SLR General Manager M.J.D. Fernando.    

 “Most of these lands are occupied by the employees of the SLR itself. We will have to charge them lease for the years they occupied the land and then take necessary action to evict them as well. Some argue that it is their right to live in the land as the SLR owes them for all the delayed salary increments, etc. This is an issue that will have to be taken up separately by them,” he told    The Sunday Morning   .    

 He added that these employees have taken over the land gradually over time.  

 “The Railway Reserve land falls under the purview of the Superintendent of Railways of the area and the Station Master of the respective railway station in the area. Over the years, these employees have misused their positions of power and gone ahead to construct private dwellings.”  

 Last week, Minister of Transport Gamini   Lokuge appointed a four-member cabinet subcommittee to deliberate and make recommendations on how the land could be reacquired and the monies owed to the Department of Railways recovered from the personnel illegally occupying state-owned land.    

 Fernando said that the SLR is awaiting the necessary directives by the Cabinet Minister and the policy decisions after the committee carries out an investigation into and a study on the lands in question. 

 However, the cabinet subcommittee meeting that was to take place last Friday (16) to look into reclaiming the Sri Lanka Railways Reserve land occupied by squatters was postponed to this week.  

 Minister   Lokuge, when contacted by    The Sunday Morning   , said: “We are yet to discuss the technicalities of the reclamation process. But most of all, we are also looking to recover the monies that they owe to the Government for the years they occupied the lands.”    

 The cabinet subcommittee headed by Minister   Lokuge comprises Minister of Public Services, Provincial Councils, and Local Government Janaka Bandara Tennakoon; Minister of Land S.M. Chandrasena; and State Minister of Money and Capital Market and State Enterprise Reforms Ajith Nivard Cabraal.    ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Railways to punish ‘squatting’ employees,news,0,1602982556,0,101417,,

,,"Indian High Commissioner, PM meeting | ECT not discussed",news," By Maheesha Mudugamuwa  

 The controversial East Container Terminal (ECT), which was to be developed by India, Japan, and Sri Lanka, was not discussed at Thursday's (15) meeting between High Commissioner of India Gopal Baglay and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa at Temple Trees, according to both parties.  

 When asked by    The Sunday Morning    whether the ECT was discussed at the meeting, Prime Minister's Media Secretary Rohan Weliwita said it was not. Indian High Commission Spokesperson Neha Singh told    The Sunday Morning    that whatever was discussed at the meeting was in the press releases issued by the High Commission and Prime Minister’s office.    

 The meeting was held following the Virtual Bilateral Summit (VBS) between the Indian Prime Minister and Sri Lanka held on 26 September. The meeting was held to seek the guidance of Rajapaksa to take further steps on the areas that were discussed during the VBS.  

 When contacted by    The Sunday Morning   , Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) Additional Managing Director Upul Jayatissa said the SLPA had not yet received any update on the ECT from the Government yet.    

 Moreover, Ports and Shipping Ministry Secretary U.D.C.   Jayalal told    The Sunday Morning    that the Ministry had not yet taken any decision with regard to the ECT.    

 When asked whether the Government or the Ministry is holding discussions regarding the ECT, he said there were no ongoing discussions within the Government as of yet.  

 Meanwhile, port trade unions are waiting for the Government’s decision on the terminal.   

 At the meeting at Temple Trees, the Indian High Commissioner noted several areas on which the two countries could collaborate, including water requirements in schools, sanitation needs, rainwater harvesting, building of toilets for deprived areas, and a project that could convert sewage into fertiliser. Rajapaksa had indicated that the lack of safe drinking water in certain parts of the country is the main concern, including the role it plays in chronic kidney disease. This is now a key priority for the Sri Lankan Government.  

 He had also noted that the lack of drinking water is a particularly serious problem in the Dry Zone of Sri Lanka and requested the High Commissioner to look into any assistance that can be provided towards that end.  

 The Prime Minister had also requested India to look at the pharmaceutical sector and encourage Indian investors to establish research and manufacturing facilities in Sri Lanka to help the country meet its medicinal drug requirements.  

 The High Commissioner stressed the significance of facilitating mutually beneficial trade and investment between India and Sri Lanka, which are close maritime neighbours and friends.

,,Duty waiver on essential items : No immediate price reduction,news," By Maheesha Mudugamuwa 

 Despite the decision taken by the Government to remove import duties on essential food commodities with immediate effect, there is unlikely to be a price reduction at least until November, according to essential food importers. 

 Speaking to    The Sunday Morning   , Essential Food Commodities Importers and Traders’ Association (EFCITA) President G. Rajendran noted that the items imported under last week’s duty exemption would arrive only in three to four weeks. 

 If the prices are reduced before that time, the importers and traders would have to incur a massive loss, Rajendran said. This is because the stocks of these essential commodities now available in the local market were brought down to the country several weeks ago after paying the earlier import duties. 

 In a press release issued by the Presidential Secretariat, it was announced that with due consideration to the current cost of living and difficulties associated with Covid-19, the Government has removed import duties on essential commodities such as dhal, canned fish, big onions, and sugar. 

 As a result, the price of canned fish (large) has been reduced to Rs. 200, a kilogramme of big onions to Rs. 100, and a kilogramme of sugar to Rs. 85. 

 “We are mainly importing items from India and we are worried as India could ban the exports at any time. Therefore, we have imported stocks for about two to three weeks. If India stops, we have to look for some other country, and there it will take another three to four weeks for stocks to come to Sri Lanka. We have to dispose of at least 50% of the stocks to get a new consignment,” Rajendran said. 

 He noted that India has banned the exportation of big onions and that it now has to be imported to Sri Lanka from Holland, China, and Pakistan. 

 “The prices of big onions in the world market have also gone up greatly. It’s above $ 500. We won’t be able to make any new bookings. India will import from other countries and the containers coming to Sri Lanka will also be diverted to India, if the Government does not increase the price. There will be a sugar and canned fish shortage because price reduction will not be immediately done. There might be a shortage of big onions also if this continues,” Rajendran said. 

 Meanwhile, Minister of Trade Dr. Bandula Gunawardana said the Government will purchase big onions directly from farmers at Rs. 130 per kg through the Sathosa retail chain and sell them at Rs. 100. He said big onions would be sold at Sathosa at Rs. 100 and the Government would absorb the additional cost of Rs. 30.

,,UPFA-UNF gear for major showdown in battle for supremacy,news,"Fractions between the United National Front (UNF) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) – which is the main constituent party of the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) – have been surfacing for a while. However, intense battles between the two groups started to surface following the alleged plot to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and several other VIPs. The situation was further compounded when the UNF failed to allocate finances for rural development under the Gamperaliya programme and tried to force the leasing out of the East Container Terminal at the Colombo Port to India and Japan, ignoring objections raised by the President.
It was also no secret that Sirisena on several occasions expressed his displeasure at the delays in investigations being carried out to crack down of alleged incidents of corruption and fraud. On several occasions, Sirisena told his confidantes that former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was trying to empower former President Mahinda Rajapaksa following his presidential defeat, in order to create a split in the SLFP and control him.
Interestingly, it is now evident that Wickremesinghe’s “smart move” has boomeranged with Rajapaksa and his loyalists gaining political momentum and becoming a decisive group in Sri Lankan politics. Hence, the parting of ways between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe has been coming for a while.
The fact that all’s not well between the President and the Prime Minister, which is the first sign of what was to follow towards the latter part of the week, was witnessed on Monday (22).
Addressing the launching ceremony of the biography of F.R. Senanayake, Sirisena said when he became the common candidate at the 2015 presidential election; he had assumed that he was joining the UNP created by D.S. Senanayake and Dudley Senanayake.
“But soon I realised that it was an entirely different party,” the President has said.
“The UNP back then,” Sirisena noted, “was a party that cherished our own values. It wanted to uplift our own industries. It aspired to strengthen the national economy. This was the vision of the likes of D.S. Senanayake who founded the UNP.”
Sirisena’s outburst on Monday indicated that the days of the “odd couple” were numbered.
Be that as it may, no one quite expected such chaos, following the separation of the odd couple.
The couple, together with their political parties, is now gearing for a power showdown to secure their powerbases.
The stage for the entire power shift was set by Rajapaksa’s sibling Basil Rajapaksa. The wheels were set in motion following Basil’s meeting with Sirisena held a few weeks back. The final meeting to seal the deal was held on Thursday night, which was a highly confidential meeting known only by the Rajapaksa family members and not known by Rajapaksa loyalists. In fact, apart from MPs S.B. Dissanayake, Thilanga Sumathipala, and Lakshman Wasantha Perera, no one was aware of a plan to form a government with the President.
Even on Friday, it was Lakshman Wasantha Perera who called parliamentarians of the SLPP and asked them to attend a meeting at Hotel Ramada in Colombo in the evening. When the MPs asked for the details, they were informed that it was a meeting. Only when the MPs arrived at the hotel were they informed that they had to make their way to the Presidential Secretariat for the swearing in of the new Prime Minister.

 Friday night drama 

Signs of the impending chaos were evident as soon as measures were taken by the Police to barricade Paget Road where the President’s official residence is located. Special Task Force (STF) personnel with weapons were also stationed on the road and surrounding areas.
Inquiries were then made by many as to what was going on at the President’s residence only to learn that the Fort Police took steps to barricade the Presidential Secretariat as well.
Even though people were unaware of what was really in store on Friday evening, some realised that something of great significance that would gather outrage was taking place behind the walls of the Secretariat.
At the time, Sirisena was addressing the group of SLFP ministers and deputy ministers in the Government, and MP Dayasiri Jayasekera was also among them.
At the outset of the meeting, the President told the group that he was concerned about the manner in which the Government was functioning at present.
He has said that he was extremely disturbed by the manner in which the Prime Minister and the UNP approached the issue of the alleged plot to assassinate him and the former Defence Secretary by a senior officer of the Police force.
The President made special mention of the attitude of the likes of Ranjith Madduma Bandara and Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka.
Reference was also made to the latest revelation about Fonseka’s alleged link to former head of the Terrorism Investigations Division (TID) DIG Nalaka de Silva, who is currently in remand custody. The group of ministers was informed that the police officer whom de Silva had allegedly tried to assassinate, as uncovered by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) probe, was in fact the officer who had apprehended Fonseka’s loyalists in the Lasantha Wickrematunge murder probe. (See box)
Sirisena told the SLFPers that the UNP ministers in government did not pay any attention to the concerns raised by him about the matter, while the continuous calls by him to replace the Inspector General of Police had also fallen on deaf ears.
“How can I govern in this manner?” he has asked the group. “I don’t have plans of contesting again,” the President added.
The SLFP group sans Jayasekera, which stood together since the vote on the no faith motion against the Prime Minister earlier in the year, said that it was indeed worrying and that there needs to be an open dialogue to resolve these issues.
Sirisena then said that the group had to now stand as one and support him, to which the SLFPers steadfastly agreed.
“Whatever I decide, I will have the best interest of all of you at heart. Stand by me as we need to be united,” the President said. Once again the group of SLFPers unanimously agreed with the President.
The meeting ended afterwards and the President requested several of the ministers to remain.
It was around this time that Secretary to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa – Lalith Weeratunge – had arrived at the Presidential Secretariat.
Weeratunge had smiled and exchanged pleasantries with everyone gathered in the room and made his way to the President. After exchanging a few words in secret, Weeratunge then moved aside.

 Forming an alliance 

Ministers Mahinda Amaraweera and Duminda Dissanayake stayed back and retired to the President’s office at the Secretariat. Several other ministers also joined them, but left shortly afterwards.
The President then sat down with Amaraweera and Dissanayake and reiterated that he could no longer continue with the Unity Government with the UNF.
At this point, the two ministers inquired from the President as to whether he had an alternative plan in mind. When the President responded in the affirmative, both Amaraweera and Dissanayake deduced that Sirisena in fact was hinting about joining with the “Joint Opposition” (JO), which was earlier termed as news fabricated by MP S.B. Dissanayake.
When asked whether the President was contemplating joining the “JO”, he said “yes.” When asked if Rajapaksa would be appointed prime minister, the President responded “yes”.
As to whether steps would be taken to dissolve the Sri Lanka Podujana Party (SLPP) once members of the “JO” and the SLFP unite, Sirisena said there were legal impediments since the SLPP held positions in local government bodies.
The next question directed at the President was when it would take place; Sirisena responded “now”.
It was then that both Amaraweera and Dissanayake realised that Weerakoon was in fact waiting for Rajapaksa’s arrival.
Sirisena together with Amaraweera and Dissanayake then walked to the window in the secretariat office and peered through it.
A few minutes later, the President was informed of Rajapaksa’s arrival at the Secretariat.
Rajapaksa first made his way to the washroom and then to the President’s office.
Sirisena, Rajapaksa, Amaraweera, and Dissanayake, after acknowledging each other, engaged in a discussion on how to go about the swearing in.
Rajapaksa inquired as to whether the UPFA officially announced its decision to move out of the Government. He was informed that the necessary steps were taken.
In fact, contrary to statements given to the media by the likes of Amaraweera, the letter to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya announcing the UPFA’s decision to quit the Unity Government was sent a few minutes earlier.

 Auspicious time 

The auspicious time for the swearing in was between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. on Friday. It was surprising to see Rajapaksa working according to such a broad time frame when he had previously adhered to precise times and directions.
One by one the “JO” members started to filter into the room.
Seeing elder brother MP Chamal Rajapaksa, Mahinda Rajapaksa approached him and said that he did not contact Chamal and instead informed Shashindra Rajapkasa of the swearing in since he was unaware Chamal would be available to attend the ceremony.
The architect of the whole move – Basil – walked in with a smile and asked Sirisena whether everything was in order.
Meanwhile, MP Susil Premajayanth started to highlight the legal points that needed to be dealt with in order to ensure a smooth transition of government power.
Finally, once the room filled, it was decided that the swearing in process would commence.
The rest of the proceedings were viewed by almost every Sri Lankan through electronic and social media.
Afterwards, the President sent a letter to Wickremesinghe informing him of his removal from the post while Wickremesinghe responded saying that he remained as the constitutional Prime Minister.
Finally, the gazette notifications announcing Wickremesinghe’s removal and Rajapaksa’s appointment were released on Friday night.
However, last morning, legal experts were called in to explain through different media that Rajapaksa’s appointment as Prime Minister was in line with constitutional provisions.
According to legal experts, the Cabinet of Ministers stands dissolved when a constituent partner of a national government moves out. This permits the President to appoint a prime minister whom he believes commands the majority support in Parliament.
Nevertheless, the appointment will be deemed an interim position until he shows his majority strength in Parliament.
Furthermore, last evening, President Sirisena issued a directive to remove Wickremesinghe’s security detail, to which the UNP, in response, requested the intervention of the Speaker of Parliament.

 MR silent 

Be that as it may, contrary to usual practice, Rajapaksa has opted to remain silent without making any public statements following his appointment as Prime Minister.
The public and media expected a public statement by Rajapaksa on Friday night after being sworn in as Prime Minister.
Instead of making his usual passionate speech before cameras, Rajapaksa opted to visit the Gangaramaya and Abhayarama temples before returning to his Wijerama Mawatha residence. After reaching his residence and hearing of the fisticuffs at the state media institutions, he made a very brief public address asking everyone to act calmly without engaging in any violent activity.
Rajapaksa remained silent afterwards. Statements to the media were made by all his loyalists and he refrained from addressing the media at the press conference called by SLPP party leaders.
Rajapaksa’s silence has now started to give confidence to the UNF parliamentary group that the UPFA has not yet got its numbers sorted.
The decision by the President to prorogue Parliament till 16 November has further fuelled belief that the UPFA is short of achieving the 113 members of Parliament required to officially endorse its stand as the governing party.
MP Dinesh Gunawardena, addressing the media, said that the new Prime Minister needed two weeks to get all affairs in order and that was the reason for the prorogation of Parliament.
It was evident that Rajapaksa wanted to ensure that all his numbers in Parliament were in place before making a public appearance.

 Group leadership 

However, the group of 23 SLFPers who remained in the Unity Government, following the defeated No Faith Motion against Wickremesinghe, were disturbed last morning when they were called for a meeting of the UPFA group at Rajapaksa’s Wijerama Mawatha residence.
A majority of the members in the group felt that the first group meeting should be at a neutral ground and not at Rajapaksa’s residence. The meeting was summoned at 10.30 a.m.
Members of the group instead made their way to Sirisena’s residence on Paget Road.
They explained that the President needs to be the leader of the UPFA group since he is the Leader of the SLFP and UPFA.
“We stood by you. We didn’t have any personal issues with Mahinda, but when you blamed Rajapaksa we also stood by you. So try to understand that this sudden change is not easy for us. Until things start functioning smoothly, you need to lead the group,” all the members of the group said.
Sirisena agreed and said that he would convene a meeting of the UPFA group at the Presidential Secretariat at 6.30 p.m. last evening.
The meeting was to discuss the interim Cabinet that would be appointed until Parliament convenes on 16 November when the UPFA and UNF have both vowed to show their majority in the House.

 Common alliance 

Despite all the political chaos, the common alliance in the making, under the leadership of MP Rajitha Senaratne, continues.
Senaratne together with Malik Samarawickrema, Akila Kariyawasam, Rauf Hakeem, Rishard Bathiudeen, Palani Digambaram, and Champika Ranawaka have met for a discussion on Monday (22) night at Temple Trees.
All those gathered at the discussion have unanimously agreed that there is an urgent necessity to form a common alliance under a common symbol.
It was decided that the constitution of the alliance be formulated immediately and work be carried out to launch the alliance early next year.
Even after the chaotic turn of events on Friday, Senaratne told  The Sunday Morning  that the work on forming the common alliance would now be expedited since it would be the electoral front even for the United National Party (UNP).
Given the current political situation, it is evident that the country would face a general election early next year. It is also one of the main demands of Basil Rajapaksa.
The new government, once formed, would be a caretaker government that would function in the interim period, in the run up to the next general election.
“We must gain power through the people’s mandate. That is when we form the proper government,” Basil told  The Sunday Morning  a few weeks back.
Following a “vote on accounts”, when Parliament convenes on 16 November, moves will be in place to make way for elections. Hence, general elections are likely to be held during the early part of 2019.

The silent community

Meanwhile, Wickremesinghe met with representatives of the diplomatic community of the country at Temple Trees last (27) evening to apprise them of the political and constitutional crisis in the country.
It was a closed-door meeting.
UNP sources told  The Sunday Morning  that Wickremesinghe had informed the diplomatic community of the constitutional crisis created by the President in appointing Rajapaksa as Prime Minister.
It is interesting to note that apart from issuing travel advisories and statements expressing concern over the situation in Sri Lanka, members of the international community refrained from issuing congratulatory notes to the newly-appointed Prime Minister – all except for China that is.
This indicates that Rajapaksa has not received legitimacy yet, as all eyes are focused on the numbers game and its outcome.
However,  The Sunday Morning  learns that the President also decided to call for a meeting with the diplomatic community tomorrow (29).",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,UPFA-UNF gear for major showdown in battle for supremacy,news,0,1540707624,0,10143,,
,,20A Bill debate | Three days reduced to two,news," 
           Parliament to extend hours on Wednesday and Thursday  
 
 By Skandha Gunasekara 

 The 20th Amendment to the Constitution Bill is to be debated for two days next week on Wednesday (21) and Thursday (22). 

 Leader of the House and Minister of Foreign Affairs Dinesh Gunawardena said that a two-day debate was agreed upon during the parliamentary party leaders’ meeting on Friday (16). 

 He said the Opposition requested a three-day debate, but the Government had declined. 

 “We said we would keep it to two days, but we have extended the parliamentary sessions for a longer period than the norm,” he said.  

 Accordingly, the debates would go on till 7 p.m., whereas the parliamentary sitting usually concludes by 4.30 p.m. 

 Nevertheless, the Opposition had been disappointed with the decision to curtail the debate to just two days.

,,300 MW Kerawalapitiya LNG plant : CEB awaits Cabinet nod,news," By Maheesha Mudugamuwa 

 The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is awaiting cabinet approval to sign the electricity purchasing agreements with Lakdhanavi Ltd. to construct a long-awaited 300 MW liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in Kerawalapitiya. 

 CEB Chairman Eng. Vijitha Herath told    The Sunday Morning    that the approval from the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) and the Attorney General’s opinion would be received in parallel, adding that as soon as the cabinet approval is granted, the agreements would be signed and the construction would begin. 

 “We have already submitted the cabinet papers,” he added. 

 When construction begins, this will be the first power plant constructed in Sri Lanka in eight years, Eng. Herath noted. 

 Furthermore, he said the tenders would also be called for the construction of another 300 MW LNG power plant in Kerawalapitiya. 

 Cabinet approval was granted last year to award the tender to set up two 300 MW LNG plants in Kerawalapitiya. The Procurement Appeal Board (PAB) approved building the Kerawalapitiya 300 MW LNG plant, awarding the contract to GCL China Windforce and RenewGen. The second contract will be awarded to Lakdhanavi to set up a new 300 MW LNG plant. 

 In January, the Cabinet approved the construction of a 300 MW LNG plant in Kerawalapitiya as a joint venture between the CEB, Japan, and India with financial support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), along with a coal-fired power plant with a capacity of 600 MW as an extension to an existing complex in the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant. 

 These projects were aimed at solving the looming power crisis and reducing the losses incurred by the CEB which results from purchasing and generating high-cost diesel electricity to meet the ever-increasing electricity demand of the country.

,,Govt. confirms Pompeo visit to Sri Lanka,news," By Skandha Gunasekara  

 The Government has confirmed that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would be making a brief visit to Sri Lanka, following an official and lengthier visit to New Delhi, India.  

 “He will be coming to Delhi and then to Colombo. It will be a short visit of a few hours,” Minister of Foreign Affairs Dinesh Gunawardena told    The Sunday Morning    on Friday (16).  

 He added that Pompeo would be meeting President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.  

 “He will meet with President (Gotabaya) Rajapaksa, Prime Minister (Mahinda) Rajapaksa, and officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,” Minister Gunawardena said.  

 When asked whether the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Compact would be discussed, Gunawardena said that it was a friendly visit and many topics could be touched on.  

 “We don’t know yet but obviously they will raise matters important to them. What matters to us, we will have to express. But it is a very friendly visit,” he said.  

 Meanwhile, Government Spokesman and Minister of Mass Media Keheliya Rambukwella said that it was possible that new proposals could be made during the visit.  

 “Anyway, they might come out with certain other proposals and they will be accepted or rejected.”  

 While Pompeo’s visit to India is to conclude on 27 October, his arrival to Sri Lanka is yet officially unconfirmed, according to the US Embassy.  

 “There has been no official announcement from the US State Department on the US Secretary of State’s visit to Sri Lanka. If and when such a visit is finalised, the US State Department will make an official announcement,” US Embassy in Colombo Spokeswoman Nancy Van Horne told    The Sunday Morning   .

,,Army to guard environment,news," By Sarah Hannan    

 The Ministry of Environment has sought the assistance of the Sri Lanka Army to set up a special environment protection and monitoring unit which can launch investigations,    The Sunday Morning    learnt.  

 Speaking to    The Sunday Morning   , Minister of Environment Mahinda Amaraweera said that the unit will be empowered to launch investigations over the environmental destruction that is taking place, regardless of the jurisdiction it belongs to. The unit will specially focus on the illegal sand mining incidents that have been rampant in the country. 

 “For the moment, they will be able to investigate the incidents and immediately deploy teams to the site of destruction. With the Environment Act amendments that will come into place in the next few weeks, these teams will be given the legal authority to take necessary action against the perpetrators as well,” the Minister added.  

 Moreover, taking into account media reports that more environmental damage has been reported in recent times, the Ministry of Environment has taken steps to introduce three direct telephone numbers and a mobile phone number to assist the public to immediately inform any event of environmental damage in the area.  

 Accordingly, the public is requested to get in touch with the Ministry of Environment – 1991, Central Environmental Authority – 1981, Geological Survey and Mines Bureau – 1921, or to contact the Minister himself on 0707555666 by sending a WhatsApp message, text message, or video.  

 The Minister said that the environmental damage highlighted by some social media outlets are untrue. He added that 10-15 acres of private land that have been left uncultivated for years are being cleared for cultivation, which these social media outlets are interpreting as deforestation.  

 The Minister further emphasised that a request has been made to the Attorney General to amend the Environmental Act expeditiously to increase the existing penalties and fines for those who cause harm to the environment.

,,No blended oils gazette authorisation : CAA,news," By Sarah Hannan  

 The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) on Friday (16) denied claims that were made by the All Ceylon Traditional Coconut Oil Producers' Association (ACTCOPA) that the CAA had issued a gazette notification authorising the importation of blended oils.  

 “We categorically deny the claims that are made by the said organisation and can assure that there is no such gazette notification or directive that was issued by our authority in 2016,” CAA Director Asela Bandara confirmed to    The Sunday Morning   .  

 The ACTCOPA had last month requested that the Government take immediate action and rescind the alleged gazette notification issued by the CAA on 7 October 2016 under Gazette No. 195/5, authorising the importation of blended oils under the directives of then Minister of Industries and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen.  

 When The Sunday Morning further investigated to locate a gazette issued under such a number, there were no results that returned.  

 “We informed President Gotabaya Rajapaksa about this, but are yet to receive his response to the concerns that we raised. Sri Lanka currently imports 240,000 metric tonnes of palm oil a year, which would generate an additional profit of around Rs. 20,000 million for large-scale racketeers who are benefiting from the present gazette notification,” ACTCOPA Convenor Buddhika de Silva told the media at a recent press briefing.  

 The ACTCOPA requested the Government to provide them with the necessary raw materials and machinery to reduce spending large sums of money to import oil from other countries.  

 He urged that the Government should consider providing loans at concessionary interest rates to uplift the declining local coconut oil industry.  

 “If we are allowed to import copra and shredded coconut instead of importing coconut oil from abroad, we would be able to increase the local coconut oil production,” de Silva added.

,,Prasanna headed Lasantha probe,news,"BOX               The investigation into the former head of the Terrorism Investigations Division (TID) DIG Nalaka de Silva, over the alleged plot to assassinate the President, has revealed more damning matters.       De Silva is being accused of attempting to assassinate ASP Prasanna de Alwis.       The report filed by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) on de Silva, after he was apprehended, states that he discussed a plot to assassinate de Alwis.       The latest discovery would have been yet another allegation leveled against de Silva, if not for the most recent statement made by Namal Kumara of the Anti-Corruption Force, that de Silva had close links with Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka.       Namal Kumara continuously made revelations in relation to de Silva, after his first exposé of the DIG’s alleged attempt to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena.       According to Namal Kumara, Fonseka was the main political figure de Silva associated.       It is in this light that drawing a link between de Alwis and Fonseka becomes important.        It was de Alwis who, as the OIC of the TID in 2011, handled the investigation into the murder of the founding Editor of  The Sunday Leader  newspaper Lasantha Wickrematunge.       In 2011, when the case was taken up for hearing at the Mount Lavinia Magistrate Court, the TID informed court that investigations were still being carried out to apprehend the main suspect in the murder.        About a year earlier, the TID arrested 12 army soldiers attached to the Army Military Intelligence Unit identified as having worked closely with Fonseka during his tenure as Army Commander. Investigators then started looking into the possible involvement of Fonseka in Wickrematunge’s murder.       It was reported in the media, at the time, that the TID investigators had taken into custody five mobile phones that operated on the same route as Wickrematunge on the day he was murdered, while the soldiers who were arrested were narrowed down to seven prime suspects.         However, after detaining them for a brief period, the army personnel were released and details of their release were unknown.        Meanwhile, Fonseka aide, Brigadier Duminda Keppetiwala was also detained and statements by him were recorded about Wickrematunge’s murder. However, he too was released after a brief detention.        Furthermore, the former army intelligence officer Kandegedara Piyawansa, who was initially arrested and later acquitted in the case, had made a statement in open court during one of the hearings in 2011 that one OIC Prasanna de Alwis of the TID tried to influence him to make a statement implicating a senior military officer in Wickrematunge’s assassination.       The TID however rejected the claim. Nevertheless, this could be a reason for de Alwis to have earned Fonseka’s wrath. If indeed de Silva has links to Fonseka as alleged by Namal Kumara, it could explain why de Alwis may have been a point of discussion for the DIG.

,,Costly private power deals continue,news," By Maheesha Mudugamuwa    


 The costly deal reached between the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and ACE Power Embilipitiya, a private power plant, has once again entered the limelight, as electricity experts claim that the country will have to depend on private diesel power plants for at least another four years.  

 The prediction is made considering the ongoing delays in implementing several already approved Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) power plants including the 300 MW Kerawalapitiya LNG power plant which is to be built by Lakdhanavi Ltd.  

 As learnt by    The Sunday Morning   , the power purchase agreement between Lakdhahanvi Ltd. and the CEB is yet to be signed, despite it being nearly a year since Cabinet gave the green light to the project.  

 As was reported in the newspaper in February this year, the Government awarded the contract to construct the second phase of the 300 MW LNG power plant in Kerawalapitiya to Lakdhanavi Ltd., overturning a Cabinet decision made by the previous Government.  

 The reason consistently given by the state-owned CEB for going ahead with costly diesel power is the gap between electricity supply and demand, mainly as a result of the lack of state-owned power plants.   

 The CEB has been singing the same tune over the past eight years, which is ironic considering the CEB itself should be taking the sole responsibility to construct power plants in the country if they themselves predict that there will be a severe power crisis unless the required power plants are built.  

  The Sunday Morning   ’s attempts to get to the bottom of the continuous delays in constructing power plants revealed the following: The delays were due to the requirement of following due processes, delays by the relevant authorities in approving the documents, and most importantly, the inability of the responsible authorities to take stern decisions.  

""To build a new power plant, it will take another three years minimum and during that period, the CEB will have to purchase power to meet the demand or else it will have to impose power cuts which is not the solution"" CEB Chairman Eng. Vijitha Herath
    
 ‘Govt. still silent’    

 “We thought that an administration under the guidance of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa will be able to take tough decisions and speed up the delayed processes, but it’s been a year since he was appointed and a new administration took over the management, and a new power plant is yet to see the light of day,” Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)-affiliated Lanka Viduli Sevaka Sangamaya (LVSS) President Ranjan Jayalal stressed.  

 He told    The Sunday Morning    that the rulers would always go with the flow, as there was no change to any of the corrupt practices under the new Government.  

 “The power deals are yet to be reviewed and power plants are yet to be constructed, but the crisis is still going on,” he lamented.  

 According to Jayalal, while the concerns voiced against these corrupt deals were acknowledged, none of the deals were reviewed or questioned by the authorities at the time.  

 “Still, we are waiting till these corrupt deals are exposed to the public,” Jayalal noted.       

 As explained by the LVSS President, the deal reached between the CEB and ACE Power Embilipitiya was one such corrupt deal due to which the CEB incurs millions of rupees in losses per year.  

 The CEB reached a deal to purchase power from ACE Power Embilipitiya for three years, starting from April 2018.  

 According to a Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) report tabled in Parliament last year by the then COPE Chairman MP Sunil Handunnetti, Rs. 76 million is paid monthly by the CEB to ACE Power at the rate of Rs. 1.29 per unit as a capacity charge.  

 As a result, the CEB would pay Rs. 2,736 million to ACE Power over three years – the duration of the agreement.  


 COPE report on ACE Power    

 The COPE report revealed that ACE Power had offered to sell the power plant to the CEB for Rs. 2,635 million, but the offer was shot down.  

 COPE had then questioned as to why the CEB did not purchase the private power plant when the cost would have been less than what the CEB would end up paying to purchase power for three years.  

 The report noted that Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy Secretary Dr. Suren Batagoda had told the Committee that initially, an agreement had been signed for the purchase of electricity from the Embilipitiya power plant for a period of 10 years, which expired in 2015, and as the plant could be used for a further period of time, government approval was sought for further purchases.  

 Accordingly, a valuation was obtained from the Government Valuer, which was given at Rs. 2,370 million, while the value submitted by the owner of the plant was $ 17 million (Rs. 2,635 million).  

 It was also noted that, though negotiations were held, the owner did not agree to transfer the plant at the valuation made by the Government Valuer.  

 As a result, temporary approval was granted by the Cabinet for the purchase of electricity for a period of six months until action was taken to acquire the said plant; this was done taking into account the electricity requirement at the time.  

 Following discussions with the owner, the agreement was renewed on two occasions, initially for one year up to 2016 and subsequently, up to 2017.  

 During this period, the Government’s policy was to halt any move to purchase power plants and instead purchase only electricity from private suppliers.  

 As a result, the agreement between the CEB and ACE Power was extended by another three years with effect from April 2018.  

 The Committee had stated that the annual report of the establishment that owns the plant had revealed that it had posted a profit of Rs. 1.1 billion in 2016/2017 through the sale of electricity at the Embilipitiya plant.  

 According to the Sri Lanka Electricity Act, the CEB could purchase power from the private sector only in an emergency situation, Jayalal said, adding that the CEB’s top management had extended the agreement with ACE Power, which had been blacklisted by the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) for violating the Electricity Act too.  

 Commenting further on the controversial power purchase agreement with ACE Power Embilipitiya, he stressed that the top management who earned commissions from the said power plant had somehow convinced the Government that the country would not receive rain for another three years and therefore, purchasing power from the private sector would be the best solution.  

 However, the three-year extended agreement is to expire next year.  


 New plants pending finalisation    

 When contacted by    The Sunday Morning   , CEB Chairman Eng. Vijitha Herath said the CEB had no option but to further extend the agreement next year after a thorough evaluation and with a cabinet decision, as the CEB would definitely have to purchase electricity from private companies until a new power plant is built.  

 “To build a new power plant, it will take another three years minimum and during that period, the CEB will have to purchase power to meet the demand or else it will have to impose power cuts which is not the solution,” he said, adding that the only solution to the existing crisis was to shift to LNG power.  

 “We are in the process of finalising the documentation work needed for the construction and tendering of power plants, and once the LNG plant is in place, costly diesel power will not be required,” he added.

,,East Container Terminal : Colombo Port’s hub status at risk,focus," By Maheesha Mudugamuwa 

 Shipping and ports industry experts have raised concerns over the impending risk of losing Colombo Port’s transhipment hub status in the region due to the delay in developing its East Container Terminal (ECT). 


 They have also warned that the port itself is at risk and posed a huge threat of losing cargo volumes. The delay in launching operations of the ECT has caused the government a loss of around Rs. 50 billion per year. 

 As learnt by    The Sunday Morning   , the Government is yet to take a decision on the development of the ECT as well as whether it should be developed under the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) or handed over to India as per the agreements reached by the previous Government. 

 Furthermore, the Government is also yet to discuss the agreements reached between India and Sri Lanka under the leadership of former President Maithripala Sirisena on the development of the terminal. 

 Even if the green light is given to construct the ECT now, it will take at least another three years to complete the construction work and operate in its full capacity, it is learnt. Therefore, subject matter experts warned that further delaying the launch of the development activities will cause the government a loss of millions of rupees per day. 

 Still waiting on promises 

 In such a backdrop, the Joint Trade Union Collective of the Colombo Port urged the Government to fulfil the promise it made during the election that the terminal would not be handed over to India and will be taken under the control of the SLPA. 

 Speaking to    The Sunday Morning   , All Ceylon General Ports Workers’ Union (ACGPWU) Secretary Chandrasiri Mahagamage said that at a meeting held with the Joint Trade Unions Collective last month, they had decided to remind the Minister of Ports and Shipping and the President of the promises they made, urging them to take immediate action to develop the ECT and start operations. 

 They had also raised concerns over the delay in completing terminal planning, which should have been done by the authority for commencing commercial operations of the ECT several months ago, even prior to the general election. 

 The operation planning of the terminal should be completed in order to begin the commercial operations of the terminal, a topic which has recently come to light due to the loading of gantry cranes ordered for the Jaya Container Terminal JCT which is still under construction. 

 The trade unions attached to the SLPA had recently held an industrial action demanding the Prime Minister or President to give an assurance that the ECT will not be handed over to India. However, according to the verbal assurance given by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, any attempt to legalise the Memorandum of Co-operation (MoC) signed between India, Sri Lanka, and Japan would not be allowed. 

 Colombo Port and ECT 

 The Colombo Port, primarily a container port, is a rapidly growing maritime hub in the South Asian region and is the port connecting cargo originating from and destined to Europe, East and South Asia, the Persian Gulf, and East Africa. 

 The original port had a harbour area of 184 hectares. In 2008, the South Harbour area (285 hectares) was developed to accommodate deep-water berths and the latest generation of mainline vessels. The harbour is served by a two-way channel with an initial depth of 20 m and a width of 570 m. 

 In addition to the container terminals in the original port area, the SLPA planned to develop three terminals – each having a capacity of 2.4 million twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU) – in the South Harbour, the first of which was built and is in operation on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis by Colombo International Container Terminals Ltd. (CICT) 

 The Colombo Port currently consists of three main parts, one of which is the JCT that belongs to the SLPA. The South Asia Gateway Terminals (SAGT) is owned by Sri Lanka and international entities. A majority of the shareholding in the CICT is owned by China. This terminal is located adjacent to Colombo Port City. As a result, a terminal of sufficient capacity for the SLPA to dock large ships does not exist within the Colombo Port at present. 

 Against such a backdrop, the ECT is being developed to accommodate large ships and the SLPA commenced development at the ECT with funds obtained from a state bank. 

 According to the SLPA, the Colombo Port Expansion Project is being implemented in an area encompassing about 600 hectares. This will have three terminals: South Container Terminal (SCT), ECT, and West Container Terminal (WCT), each with a 1,200 m length and equipped with facilities to accommodate three berths. The SCT commenced operations in 2013 under a public private partnership (PPP) under the BOT basis with CICT and the SLPA. The CICT is managed by China Merchants Ports Holdings Co. Ltd. 

 The ECT, implemented by the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government under the Colombo Port Expansion Project, is the second largest deep-water project of the port. In this, 400 m of the planned 1,200 m-long terminal was completed in 2015. 

 At present, the completed 400 m stretch of the ECT is used by the SLPA to handle break-bulk cargo. 

 Awaiting committee report 

 Due to the mounting pressure put by the ports unions earlier this year, the President appointed a five-member committee consisting of the secretaries of the Ministries of Power, Energy, Ports and Shipping, Roads, and Highways together with Secretary to the Ministry of Industrial Export and Investment Promotion M.P.U.D. Mapa Pathirana and SLPA Chairman General (Retd.) Daya Ratnayake. 

 The committee is assigned to look into matters with regard to the procurement process and the delay in the development of the ECT prior to importing equipment, evaluate the agreements the SLPA has entered into with foreign nations, and look for the responsible persons for the activities mentioned above. Moreover, the committee was requested to submit proposals for the development of the ECT. 

 The committee was to prepare a report within 45 days from 3 July. 

 Then Secretary to the Ministry of Ports and Shipping M.M.P.K. Mayadunne told    The Sunday Morning    in August that the final report of the committee would be handed over on 15 August. 

 Nevertheless, there is no trace of the committee report at present, as the report is yet to be made public. 

 Govt. urged to complete construction 

 As learnt by    The Sunday Morning   , the civil work of the ECT was completed around five years ago while the electrical work was completed eight months ago. 

 The planning of the operations at the ECT was yet to be started by the SLPA, even though the necessary funds had been allocated for the establishment of the planning unit for the ECT from the annual budget. 

 The delay in launching the planning work of the terminal raised doubts among the unions, as they were concerned whether there was any attempt to hand over the development of ECT to India. 

 Last year, the SLPA signed the joint MoC to develop the ECT at the Colombo Port. The SLPA stated that the new partnership would help the port to continue its growth and further improve its competitiveness by opening itself to the world. 

 According to the authority, the SLPA retains full ownership of the ECT, and a company named Terminal Operations Company (TOC) would be established where Sri Lanka would retain 51% of shares while the balance will be purchased by joint venture partners. 

 The MoC was reached soon after China was given a controlling equity stake and a 99-year lease on the Hambantota Port, and concerns have been raised as to whether there is a suspicion that this deal is also a result of escalating geopolitical competition between regional powers. 

 During the early stages of the negotiations, the unions have threatened to cripple the operations of the Colombo Port, as their primary objection is that Sri Lanka would be handing over key port facilities to foreign nations. 

 Despite the MoC being reached between Japan, India, and Sri Lanka last year, the issue was swept under the carpet with last year’s presidential election without any further development until last month’s gantry crane unloading issue popped up. 

 When contacted by    The Sunday Morning   , SLPA Additional General Manager Upul Jayatissa said the SLPA had not yet received any update on the ECT from the Government as yet. 

 However, Secretary to the Ministry of Ports and Shipping U.D.C. Jayalal told    The Sunday Morning    that the Ministry had not yet taken any decision with regard to the ECT. 

 When asked whether the Government or the Ministry is holding discussions regarding the ECT, he said that no discussions are ongoing within the Government. 

 Meanwhile, all attempts made by    The Sunday Morning    to contact SLPA Chairman Gen. Ratnayake and Minister of Ports and Shipping Rohitha Abeygunawardena were futile.

,,The games the President plays,news,"Just last Sunday, this column contemplated whether President Maithripala Sirisena, the head of government, was representing the Opposition. On Friday, at around 8 p.m. it came to pass that our presumption was correct; when a smiling Sirisena presided at the swearing in of “Joint Opposition” Leader Mahinda Rajapaksa as the new Prime Minister before a stunned country.
Legal experts of various hues have expressed their opinions on the President’s action with some being of the view that the Constitution provided for it while others argue to the contrary. According to Articles 46(2) and 48 of the 19th Amendment enacted in 2015 with a resounding majority of 215 votes, the Prime Minister can cease to hold office in four specific instances: death, resignation, ceasing to be a member of parliament, or if the government loses the confidence of parliament by a defeat of the throne speech, the budget, or a vote of no-confidence. None of these have taken place.
It is noteworthy that the 19th Amendment removed the power bestowed on the president to remove the prime minister at will. With the Constitution being very clear on this, there are no other ways in which a new prime minister can be appointed. Therefore, an intense legal battle is on the cards with Wickremesinghe already indicating he will take the legal route. He owes that much to his party, which stood by him to defeat the No Confidence Motion earlier this year.
President Maithripala Sirisena has been an unpredictable entity from the word go. In a matter of three years, he has managed to go back on pretty much everything he said during the hustings. The ultimate irony is that the man who he claimed would have buried him six feet under, had he lost the election, is now the Prime Minister appointed by him. The deception of an unsuspecting public – especially the UNP vote base on whose shoulders Sirisena rode to office – is of monumental proportions. One has to feel for them, having waited for so long to have their man in office, only to realise they were well and truly duped, again.
We have no qualms about which party should rule or who should be president or prime minister, what matters to us as watchdogs of the public interest is the manner in which such appointments are made and such office is assumed. The secrecy in which Mahinda Rajapaksa was appointed Prime Minister, while Wickremesinghe was still holding that office, is nothing short of a constitutional coup, and to think that it was orchestrated by no less a person than the President of the country, is alarming.
No doubt the fallout of the coup will have its consequences, and the country will once again be dragged into the dog house by the international community, which up until now had high praise for the Yahapalana arrangement.
Wickremesinghe, who comfortably survived a motion of no confidence against him earlier this year, is confident of his party’s parliamentary majority and called for the urgent summoning of Parliament. The President responded by proroguing Parliament till 16 November, providing a window to get the numbers in place. One can be assured that MPs will not complain, as the bidding games will now begin.
The manner in which state media institutions were taken over minutes after the swearing in, by organised thugs, points to a well-coordinated plan and the fact that the entire UNP, which for all intents and purposes was in power but yet completely oblivious to the unfolding developments, shows the level of secrecy with which the operation was executed.
The media that enjoyed unbridled freedom for the past three years got a taste of what was in store when thugs took control of state broadcasters Rupavanini and ITN, forcing the stations to go off the air during the melee.
It was the same at Lake House, with thugs chasing away journalists who were on duty. A return to the dark era, where media personnel were the subjects of persecution, is not what this country voted for in January, 2015, and the fact that such a scenario seemed to be unfolding under the leadership of the man who was supposed to be their savior, is one more betrayal that will be placed at Sirisena’s altar.
Meanwhile, an interesting theory has surfaced about the famous hopper supper hosted by Rajapaksa. Consider for a moment the possibility that it was in fact the night an agreement was reached on the modus operandi to craft Rajapaksa’s political future. Rajapaksa, the shrewd politician that he is, knew very well the Presidential election of 2015 would be a close call. It could go either way and he could not afford to lose.
Then he did the unthinkable. Aware that the Opposition was on the lookout for a presidential candidate, he would provide one; and Sirisena fit the bill perfectly. This way, even if Rajapaksa lost, he would still win through his proxy. All he had to do was stay in the shadows for three years and then, just like that, he would be Prime Minister. Although conjecture, it does seem to make sense given the turn of events.
During the past three-year period, if one were to connect the dots with regard to the actions of the President, there has been a consistent pattern that points to a plan to derail his Yahapalana partner. There have been many embarrassing episodes where Cabinet decisions were overturned the next day. Questions have also been raised as to why the long arm of the law never really caught up with the former first family.
The UNP leadership, preoccupied with petty internal squabbling, should have seen this coming. Their trademark complacency has now cost them their jobs. Worst of all, the country will be in crisis mode till at least next August when parliamentary elections can be called. No investor is going to set foot here until such time there is clarity on the political front and the business sector is likely to suffer further. On the other hand, the masses will have to further tighten their belts while the highest in the land barter their mandate to stay in power.",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,The games the President plays,news,0,1540707058,0,10147,,
,,PCR testing : A costly affair for many,focus," By Maheesha Mudugamuwa    

 With the increasing number of Covid-19-positive cases reported within the country, concerns have now risen over the varying prices of PCR tests offered by private hospitals accredited by the Ministry of Health.  

 

 In parallel to the increasing number of positive cases, the demand for tests has also increased. Some factories approved by the Board of Investments (BOI) were already instructed by the authorities to conduct PCR tests for their employees from private hospitals.  


 Since testing is vital to eradicate the spread of the virus in society, and with the limited facilities and resources available with the Government, questions are also raised over the affordability of a PCR test from a government-accredited private laboratory.  

 In May, the Ministry of Health permitted five private hospitals to conduct PCR tests under strict guidelines. In addition, strict guidelines were also issued by the Ministry to inform them about the patient prior to the test as well as the results of each test.  

 Accordingly, private hospitals are to follow all Covid-19-related guidelines and are not allowed to give publicity to any Covid-19-related activities at hospitals. Moreover, the hospitals are also to follow a mechanism to trace the history of all patients.  

 However, the Ministry also issued guidelines that capped the cost of sample testing by private labs at Rs. 6,000, which is yet to be gazetted. Although the price was decided after discussing with private hospitals, it had been a mere verbal agreement.  

 Govt. can request pvt. hospitals    

 As learnt by    The Sunday Morning   , the price of a PCR test in different private hospitals approximately varies between Rs. 6,500 and Rs. 8,800.  

 The main reason for these varying prices was due to adding the cost for other services (i.e. transport, etc.) in addition to the test they provide for the patient, it is learnt.  

 When contacted by    The Sunday Morning   , Association of Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes (APHNH) President Dr. Lakith Peiris said the reason for the cost variation was mainly due to the variations in the operational costs in each private hospital.  

 The operating costs of different machines vary; the operating cost is dependent on the type, size, and various other conditions of the machine, he stressed.  

 “If you have a large-capacity machine and you want to generate reports quickly but you don’t feed the machine with its full capacity, then the operating cost naturally goes up. For example, if the machine can do 300 in one go and there are only 50 samples, the operating cost will be more. That can be one reason,” Dr. Peiris noted.  

 When asked whether the prices can be reduced, he noted that the Government could request from private hospitals and see the possibility of reducing the price.  

 “The Government is conducting PCR tests at a cost, but the private sector cannot do so. It has to pay the price of the human resources as human resources do not come freely to the private hospitals,” he said.  

 He said that everybody knows the country should conduct more tests but the Government did not have the capacity.  

 “That is one reason why the Government has recommended some private sector companies to get the tests done from private hospitals,” he stressed.  

 Explaining further, Dr. Pieris said that imposing a cap of Rs. 6,000 per test was not a scientifically decided price but a request made by the Government. He however stressed that the cost per test is high when considering all the factors taken into account, including the payments for the consultants and human resources.  

 Initially, testing was intended to be diagnostic and confirm infections in people with symptoms such as cough, fever, shortness of breath, and fatigue. At that time, there was no understanding of the risk of silent transmission within the community via infected people who had not yet developed symptoms or who never developed them, it is learnt.  

 According to Stat, a US-based media organisation, given that diagnostic focus, the coronavirus testing capacity emphasised the use of highly sensitive PCR tests that rely on amplifying DNA copies of the RNA in SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.  

 As per international media reports, in the US, while the antibodies test cost about $ 50, the PCR swab test typically costs between $ 100 and $ 200, which adds up when scaling to hundreds of millions of tests.  

 When contacted by    The Sunday Morning   , Ministry of Health Spokesman Dr. Jayaruwan Bandara said the reason for the varying prices was due to the services provided by the respective hospital to their patients, which includes providing personal protection equipment (PPEs). However, he said that generally, as per government regulations, the price per PCR test was Rs. 6,000.  

 Commenting on the various tests that can be applied, Dr. Banadara said that discussions are ongoing, seeking the possibilities of using antibody tests for Covid-19.  

 P’ment takes up matter    

 Meanwhile, more concerns have been raised last week in Parliament over the request made by the BOI, urging factory owners to direct their employees to get the PCR test done from private hospitals.  

 These concerns were raised by Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP S.M. Marikkar over the inability of government hospitals to conduct PCR tests, stressing that the factory owners would have to bear the PCR test cost that would amount to millions of rupees.  

 Marikkar further noted that taking into consideration the situation already faced by factory owners due to the Covid-19 pandemic-related financial slumps, factory owners would be further hampered by the decision taken by the BOI.  

 In its response to the increasing demand for PCR tests in private hospitals, Sri Lanka Association of Government Medical Laboratory Technologists (SLGMLT) President Ravi Kumudesh stressed that the Ministry of Health had not discussed with the MLTs who conducted the tests whether there was a possibility of conducting such a large number of tests.  

 “We can conduct more than 4,000 tests per day, and conducting tests for factory employees will not be a problem for government laboratories,” he said, adding that there were issues regarding the tests conducted by the private hospitals, as there was nobody to take responsibility.  

 “In the recent incident, government laboratories had not conducted tests on Brandix employees who are now said to have arrived from India. So, there is an issue. Who will take the responsibility?” Kumudesh questioned.  

 He also noted that the PCR test is not the only testing method that can be applied to confirm the Covid-19 virus, but that there are several testing methods which are easy to conduct. The Ministry of Health had made the PCR test compulsory prior to even looking at other options, he added.  

 Tests according to WHO    

 In April, the World Health Organisation (WHO) listed the first two diagnostic tests for emergency use during the Covid-19 pandemic. The move should help increase access to quality-assured, accurate tests for the disease. It also means the tests can now be supplied by the United Nations (UN) and other procurement agencies supporting the Covid-19 response.  

 In vitro diagnostics, the tests carried out are genesig® Real-Time PCR COVID-19 and cobas® SARS-CoV-2 Test for use on the cobas® 6800/8800 Systems.  

 The emergency use listing procedure (EUL) was established to expedite the availability of diagnostics needed in public health emergency situations. It is intended to help procurement agencies and countries navigate the large presence of different devices on the market and, by assessing them, provide assurance of the products’ quality and performance.  

 Genesig® Real-Time PCR COVID-19 is an open system more suitable for laboratories with moderate sample testing capacity, while the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 Test for use on the cobas® 6800/8800 systems is a closed system assay for larger laboratories.

,,Spotlight on the Bathiudeen brothers,focus," By Skandha Gunasekara  

 The hunt for MP Rishad Bathiudeen was on last week with authorities combing the city to carry out his arrest in accordance with the Attorney General’s (AG) instructions, while investigations into his brother Riyaj Bathiudeen were still underway from various quarters.  

On 29 September, Riyaj Bathiudeen was released from police custody after being arrested six months prior for his alleged involvement in the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks.  

 Objections to his release were quick to come with the Catholic Church being one of the first to voice its concerns.  

 Speaking at a media briefing on 3 October, Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith said that he was disappointed over the release of Bathiudeen sans proper legal proceedings.  

 “The victims of the Easter Sunday attacks are disappointed and saddened by the slow progress of the investigations and they are expecting that justice will be meted out to them,” he said.  

 On 6 October, Minister of Irrigation and State Minister of Internal Security, Home Affairs, and Disaster Management Chamal Rajapaksa informed Parliament that Bathiudeen had been released from the custody of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) due to the lack of evidence to prove that he aided and abetted in the Easter Sunday bombings.  

 “Riyaj Bathiudeen was arrested on 14 April 2020 on suspicion of his connections with Insaf Ahmed, the terrorist who blew himself up at Cinnamon Grand Colombo. According to the call records, there were 17 calls made by the suspect to the terrorist.   

 “The suspect had been detained under the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) for three days for questioning and thereafter obtained the permission of courts twice for three months each. The investigators had found that the suspect and the terrorist had no terror links and that the calls had been made for business purposes. The last call they had made was three months prior to the attacks. However, if there is new evidence, he would be arrested again. His release does not mean he is freed from all charges,” the Minister of Irrigation noted.  

 However, on 10 October, a letter was handed over to both President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa with the signatures of some 100 government-rank MPs opposing the release of Riyaj Bathiudeen.  

 This included Government seniors such as Minister of Agriculture Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Minister of Energy Udaya Gammanpila, Minister of Industries Wimal Weerawansa, and MP Dilan Perera.  

 On 11 October, AG Dappula de Livera had summoned CID Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Prasad Ranasinghe and the chief investigating officers to inquire about the release.  

 AG’s Co-ordinating Officer State Counsel Nishara Jayaratne told    The Sunday Morning    that the AG had noted during the meeting with the CID officials that Riyaj Bathiudeen’s release had hampered investigations.  

 The AG had also observed that Bathiudeen had been released on unjustifiable grounds: Failure to conduct an investigation against Riyaj Bathiudeen on money laundering, failure to assign an experienced and knowledgeable officer to conduct investigations with regard to money laundering, failure to conduct extensive investigations on terrorism activity, and failure to locate 12 of the 16 mobile phones used by Riyaj Bathiudeen.  

 The AG had then given written instructions to the CID on further investigations and special measures that need to be followed.  

 Thereafter, on 12 October, Riyaj Bathiudeen wrote to President Rajapaksa over his release and pointed out that calls for his re-arrest were politically motivated.  

 “After being thoroughly satisfied of my innocence, the CID released me from custody on 29 September 2020. There is nothing sinister; as is suggested by interested parties in the fact that the CID released me from custody without producing me before the Magistrate. Indeed, the learned Magistrate had previously made an order that the persons held in custody pending investigations could be released by the CID on the CID being satisfied that there was no evidence to warrant their continued detention. I wish to humbly submit that the demands for my re-arrest have been orchestrated due to political and communal reasons. I am confident that Your Excellency would not be influenced by such extraneous considerations,” the letter addressed to President Rajapaksa stated.   

 Meanwhile, on Tuesday (13) the AG issued directives to arrest MP Rishad Bathiudeen on charges of criminal misappropriation of public funds and violation of election laws with regard to the transportation of internationally displaced persons (IDPs) in Ceylon Transport Board (CTB) buses to vote at the 2019 presidential election.   

 Police Media Spokesman DIG Ajith Rohana told    The Sunday Morning    that investigations into Riyaj Bathiudeen were still being conducted by the CID.  

 “Investigations into Riyaj Bathiudeen are underway,” the Police Media Spokesman noted.  

 He also said that MP Rishad Bathiudeen was evading police custody.  

 “We have still not been able to locate and arrest him. We believe he is hiding and evading the Police.”  

 Meanwhile, investigations of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) probing the Easter Sunday terror attacks are continuing as well.  

 This week saw former President Maithripala Sirisena, former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and former Secretary of Defence Hemasiri Fernando continue their testimonials before the Commission.  

 Fernando refuted claims made by the former President and asserted that he had never received instructions from the latter to arrest National Thowheed Jamaath Leader Zahran Hashim.  

 He also charged that the former President should have been aware of a possible terrorist threat and as such, decided to leave the country at the time.  

 Former Prime Minister Wickremesinghe alleged during his testimony before the Commission last week that the weekly meetings of the National Security Council were discontinued after the new Government came into power in 2015.  

 Former President Sirisena told the PCoI that he had not invited former Prime Minister Wickremesinghe to the National Security Council meetings as it was not a mandatory requirement.  

 The former President also claimed that it could not be concluded that the activities of Islamic terrorists were now over, considering the fact that the Islamic State had claimed responsibility for the Easter bombings and their terror activities were still being carried out around the world.  

 The PCoI is to conclude its proceedings by the end of October.  

 Secretary to the PCoI investigating the Easter Sunday attacks Buwaneka Herath said that the Commission’s term ended on 20 December and that they would submit a report to the President before or by that date.  

 “20 December is the last date of the Commission’s functions. Our target is to complete all proceedings by the end of this month. Thereafter, we hope to compile and present the report by 20 December,” Herath noted.

,,Covid-19 : Breaking the chain of transmission,news," 
           Rational and scientific approach  
 
 By Dr. Charuni Kohombange 

 Sri Lankans were returning to near-normal life during the last couple of months, until the detection of a Covid-19-infected patient at the Gampaha District General Hospital (DGH) on 3 October. It was an incidental finding through a screening process practiced over about the last three months for influenza-like infections. This incident is a positive indicator of the effectiveness of the Sri Lankan healthcare system.  

 To discuss the strategies for breaking the chain of transmission, the Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) conducted a webinar on 10 October with eminent consultants related to the field. SLMA President Prof. Indika Karunathilake moderated the webinar.  

 This article excerpts the discussion.  

Brandix cluster: Are we in community transmission?     

 To declare a community transmission, there has to be regular appearance of patients from the community which cannot be traced to the index case. Hence, the current situation cannot be considered as community transmission. However, Sri Lanka is in stage “3b”, which is known as a stage of cluster epidemic. Hence, there’s enormous collective responsibility to contain the disease and prevent progressing to the fourth stage, which is community transmission.   

 “The numbers were rising rapidly during the first few days after tracking the patient from the garment factory in Minuwangoda, which reflected the rate of contact tracing and testing. Tracking of contacts had been a challenge due to deficiencies in the management of the garment factory in relation to keeping the records of the staff members. However, all contacts of the factory were traced, tested, and managed accordingly.   

 “Labour exchange within the garment chain was evident, and another workers was identified as being PCR-positive in the Koggala Brandix plant,” said University of Colombo Faculty of Medicine Department of Community Medicine Head Prof. M.C. Weerasinghe.   

 Strengthen the surveillance system    

 Gampaha DGH consultant respiratory physician Dr. Bodhika Samarasekara, who was the initiator of the turning point, shared his experience. “During the last two months, we were on alert. Even though the disease was apparently under control within the country, the situation of neighbouring countries did not allow us to loosen the grip. Hence, the surveillance system was increased with random sampling of patients,” he said. 

 With regards to patient management, the monitoring of the patients’ oxygen saturation is important and chest x-rays, ultrasound scans, and other basic lab investigations are needed in the primary management. 

 It is important not to overlook the management of patients with other chronic lung diseases. It is especially important to ensure early diagnosis and treatment of TB (tuberculosis) patients who can present similar symptoms as Covid-19. According to Dr. Samarasekara, a considerable number of deaths had been reported within this year due to TB.  

 Maximally utilise the minimum resources available    

 Ceylon College of Physicians President Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama, the forerunner in the frontline, shared his expertise at the discussion. With the exponential increase in numbers, it is vital to maximally utilise the minimum resources available. PCR testing should be focused mainly on the suspected patients and surveillance should be strengthened through testing at OPDs and wards. According to Dr. Wijewickrama, in the present outbreak, patients are mostly asymptomatic or having only mild symptoms. However, as the patients are experiencing a high viral load, they may still be in the early stages of the disease. Therefore, it is imperative to monitor the patients closely for about five to seven days to predict the patient outcome.   

 It is important to take appropriate precautions to safeguard healthcare workers. He further mentioned that some unnecessary precautions were seen, such as partitioning the wards, which was happening in some centres. Since it is vital to maintain good ventilation to minimise the disease spread, partitioning, and thereby congesting the wards, would be an unnecessary step.   

 He emphasised the need to take special precautions at OPDs and clinics to prevent the spread and also to treat the patients with other illnesses appropriately in a safe environment.   

 Although all PCR-positive patients are given hospitalised care at present, strategies regarding admission of the patients might change in the future, depending on the number of cases reported.   

 Dr. Wijewickrama emphasised the requirement of early detection and management of patients with dengue and leptospirosis that can be overlooked during the pandemic situation.   

 Prevention is key    

 Sri Jayewardenepura General Hospital consultant microbiologist Dr. Kushlani Jayathilaka emphasised the importance of taking precautions to preventing the spread.    

 “It appears that the public were relaxing a little during the last two months and we should never take chances with Covid-19.’’ Minimising nonessential visits to public places, wearing face masks correctly, and maintaining distance are simple but essential prerequisites to controlling the spread of the disease.  

 Educating people on the importance of adhering to preventive measures is vital. What is seen at present is that people are adhering to precautions just because of the legislation, which would not help in attitudinal change.    

 Legislation is also important to ensuring safety at institutions. More responsibility should be assumed by heads of the institutions for making arrangements to maintain space at the workplaces and providing hand-sanitising and hand-washing facilities. Furthermore, staff having symptoms should not be allowed to attend work, as it causes more harm than good in the long run.   

 Dr. Jayathilaka further stressed the need to adhere to national guidelines in all parts of the country in relation to the quarantining process.   

 Current virus strain is highly infectious     

 University of Sri Jayewardenepura Faculty of Medical Sciences Department of Immunology and Molecular Medicine Head Prof. Neelika Malavige, who is an expert in immunology and molecular medicine, shared her valuable experience on Covid-19 viral genotype sequencing. She is currently researching all the Covid-19 viral strains identified in Sri Lanka to study their mutations and virulence. According to Prof. Malavige, seven major Covid-19 strains and 153 mutations have been identified around the world up to now.  

 With her studies on virus strains in Sri Lanka, an important mutation has been detected, which is associated with high viral loads with high transmissibility.   

 “In order to contain the epidemic, precautions need to be taken irrespective of the strain of the virus,” she added.   

 Covid stigmatisation     

 Professor in psychiatry and National Institute of Fundamental Studies Chairman Prof. Athula Sumathipala emphasised the harmful effects of stigmatisation of Covid-19 patients and their families.    

 “Relatively, the public has failed in their duty, which has to be reflected seriously. Mobilising people has been affected due to stigmatisation, prejudice, and worries,” said Prof. Sumathipala. Using fear as a health promotional tool is totally incorrect and unacceptable, as it affects negatively by aggravating stigmatisation. Especially in the process of quarantining, it should never be highlighted as a punishment but rather as a preventive healthcare measure. Based on cognitive behavioural theory, the way people think and behave depends on how they perceive a message. If quarantine is perceived as a punishment, people tend to avoid and hide.   

 He requested the Covid-19 National Steering Committee to adopt evidence-based behavioural approaches and strategies in managing the patients and contacts.   

 “A huge shift in behaviour and attitude is important, as we have to live with Covid-19 for a significant time ahead,” said Prof. Sumathipala.   

 The media has to play a responsible role in engaging, empowering, and involving the public in controlling the pandemic. It is the responsibility of the media to propagate the correct message to the public.   

 ""The Covid-19 pandemic is far from over. Hence, there is a dire need of clear policies and a support system for the healthcare workers who get exposed. Priority should be on breaking the chain of transmission based on a rational and scientific approach,” said Prof. Karunathilake, in his closing remarks.

,,To lock down or not?,focus," By Pujanee Galappaththi 

 With the new cluster of Covid-19 patients coming to light and positive cases being identified all over the island, everyone is living with fear and uncertainty. In this new normal,    The Sunday Morning    spoke to a cross-section of the general public to inquire if they think whether a lockdown should be imposed and how a lockdown would in turn affect our economy. 

 
Lockdown crucial 
 M.F.M Fiham – undergrad at University of Peradeniya 

 The only way to contain the virus is with a lockdown, which would inevitably hamper the economy as expected, but do we have alternative methods to limit the spread of the virus? No. We have to remind ourselves the entire global economy is in a state of recess and this situation is not unique to us. In addition, there cannot be a complete revival of the economy until the threat of the virus is completely eradicated, which all points to one direction – another lockdown. The question whether it is a complete or partial lockdown, I leave it to the experts. 

 Also, the public needs to take the situation seriously and act according to the health and safety regulations because no lockdown would be of benefit if the public is careless and reckless. There should be a lockdown, the infected individuals should be identified, contacts and sources of transmission should be verified, and necessary precautions should be taken. This does seem to be the only way of containing the ruthless, uncompassionate virus terrorising the entire world. 
 All about self-care
 Piyumi Kithulgoda – junior architect 

 We cannot afford an islandwide curfew, even though it really is necessary health and safety-wise, with the reason being that the country’s economy has declined dreadfully over the past few years, and we need all the support possible to get back up. Therefore, regional/area isolation of high-risk areas is acceptable at this point. The fact that the capital is pretty affected and no curfew is declared as yet could pose a threat in due time, both health and economy-wise. Shutting down Colombo and major cities of the country clearly cannot be done, but we can opt for alternative operational methods, i.e. offices/professions that can operate remotely, could do so; factories/workplaces that cannot follow the above may operate in shifts. 

 Basically, both the Government and the public are obliged to attend to the situation. Public (general public and organisations in particular) cannot simply wait for the Government to resolve everything for them. It's down to self-care at this point. I also believe this is all easier said than done, and each person carries a different weightage, so you can’t single out one scenario to tackle. 
Maybe partial lockdown 
Fernando – law student
 The truth is, whether the experts like it or not, if the situation did spiral out of proportion, the Government would have imposed a lockdown, notwithstanding expert opinions. But right now on the face of it, they seem to have it under control. In the meantime, people should take care of themselves because they are not infants or toddlers. Serious consideration must be given as to how they follow Covid-19 guidelines because it's each to their own kind of thing at this point. Perhaps a partial lockdown in the coming days, if the situation does get worse, would be appropriate.” 
Adhere to instructions 
 Tuan Iqram – mass communication major 

 I think a lockdown would be utterly pointless without prior PCR tests on all citizens. But this nation has been on a steady decline for several years due to the negligence from parliamentary parties, loopholes in the legislature, and of course the citizens. Reiterating what many experts put forth, cover the mouth and nose, wear gloves, and wash hands thoroughly. Additionally, educate oneself on the virus and to recall and always adhere to instructions. 
Can’t afford a lockdown 
 Dr. S. Manoj Kumar – dental surgeon 

 I don't think there can be another lockdown. Yes, we can't afford another lockdown – people can't afford to give salaries. Already most of the people are giving half-salaries. The people should come to the norms that they are living with the virus and should follow the appropriate measures. If we go for the lockdown, it would be easier tracing those who are affected, but people could die of starvation, cancer, and psychological illnesses too, unless we are able to compensate for the ones in need. 
Must protect our people 
 Nimasha Dias – receptionist 

 The country is drowning in a great deal of fear right now; the pandemic is back and no one is sure where new patients will be identified next. Right now, we should be doing everything we can to contain the situation and protect our people. We need to safeguard our society before thinking about our economy. When it comes to that, then we can worry about it. I think the Government should take immediate steps to put the country on lockdown at least for 14 days to contain this cluster, so we can worry about other things. 
Need strict regulations
 Shehan de Alwis – freelance copywriter 

 I think imposing strict rules regarding health regulations is key at this point. Even now, we see so many people with their masks half worn, complaining about how irresponsible the Government is being. We have to take responsibility for our health right now and a lockdown will not help unless we educate the public on the need to take these health codes seriously. 
Politicians dominating over professionals 
 Mihiri Wanniarachchi – Attorney-at-Law 

 The word lockdown is a plea from the general public nowadays. People say we cannot afford a lockdown. The funny part is we never were able to afford to pay huge taxes for the sins of the politicians, but we ended up paying. We simply couldn’t afford to buy expensive cars for the politician who we appointed to serve us, yet we ended up doing so. Even if we aren’t able to afford a lockdown, we will have to go for it in order to stop the spread of the virus. 

 Even before contributing to the economy of the country, we need to live. We first need to safeguard ourselves and our families. Why should we learn to live with this virus when we simply can’t stop the spread? We were successful in the first wave because decision-makers were the doctors and the forces. Now politicians are dominating over the professionals. I personally think we should go for a three-week lockdown and let all the politicians rest at home and let the forces and the medical units handle this pandemic situation. 

 We don't need the hands extended by the foreign countries. That's why we appointed a Sri Lankan president from Sri Lankan votes. We should go for a lockdown as it is better than suffering in the future by losing our loved ones.

,,Iron woman shattered by social-media attack,news,"The offensive responses to her comments in social media, which were most likely misconstrued, have shattered Sri Lanka’s only female Olympic medallist Susanthika Jayasinghe. Jayasinghe aired those comments at the arrival in Sri Lanka of the Youth Olympic bronze medallist, long-distance runner Parami Wasanthi. Jayasinghe’s contemporary national athletes and some present ones came to her rescue on Friday (26) at the Sri Lanka Foundation in Colombo. Former athlete Dileema Peterson said she was disappointed as a woman, on the way media censured Susi over the past weeks, misinterpreting what Susi has said on Parami.  “Media can boost one’s image ell as they can destroy it,” said Peterson adding that every woman in Sri Lanka should be ashamed due to the way Susanthika was attacked for something which she has not done. The veteran athletes, showing the footage of the full speech of Susanthika to the media, said what she had intended to say has been misinterpreted by wrongfully editing it. “She (Susanthika) is doing her utmost best to serve the sport as an official attached to the Sports Ministry at present,” said Ruwan Pradeep, another veteran athlete.  “But this video which people responded quite arrogantly to; implies she was a jealous person who doesn’t like anyone else matching her Olympic feat. We need to groom the young athletes very carefully. Offering gifts is ok, but taking these young ones to the next level is something we should do with utmost care. What Susanthika actually meant, was that. I know very well that she’s striving hard to do her best to the young athletes,” stressed Pradeep. Meanwhile, joining the briefing at the eleventh hour, Susanthika said by editing her speech to shorten it, an impression has been created that she was a jealous, malicious person.  “I ask all of you to see the whole footage and then comment. Rather than going by your impulses, you need to know that we should have a long-term plan. Duncan White (the first Olympic medallist for the country) was no more, when I repeated White’s feat (in 2000). My only hope is to see another athlete bring an Olympic medal to Sri Lanka before I die.”  Photo Saman Abesiriwardana  ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Iron woman shattered by social-media attack,news,0,1540651390,0,10149,,

,,"Exports sector : Bracing for impact, ready to rise",focus," By Skandha Gunasekara  

 While economists forecast a downward trend in economic growth for the next few years, the damage to the export sector as a result of the most recent outbreak of Covid-19 in Sri Lanka is yet to be assessed, with exporters expecting a definite negative impact.  

 Akin to kicking a man when he’s down, Sri Lanka’s struggling export sector has been thrown into chaos following the eruption of another cluster at a prominent apparel factory.  

 Senior economist and former Central Bank Deputy Governor Dr. W.A. Wijewardena pointed out that the export sector, which was showing an upward trend in the last few months, would now face further setbacks.  

 “The export sector was actually picking up and we were coming to experience a V-shaped recovery by the end of July, but by August, we saw it was again moving downwards. With this new outbreak, I expect it will fall to an even lower level within the next few months, which means we will be experiencing a typical W-shaped recovery path rather than a V-shaped recovery. This means it will take Sri Lanka a longer time period to get adjusted to the new situation,” Dr. Wijewardena said.  

 He noted that Sri Lanka’s economy had been struggling even before the global Covid-19 pandemic and that a negative economic growth had been predicted for the country in the coming years.  

 “Even before Covid-19, Sri Lanka’s economy was ailing – it was a sick economy. What Covid-19 has done is exacerbated and aggravated this situation. So, we need immediate measures to come out of the present economic downturn and then medium-to-long-term measures to move it upward so that we’ll be able to move back to the target growth of 6.5% by this Government. Right now, it is in the negative region. All analysts have come out with an estimate that Sri Lanka will experience a negative economic growth of about 6% in 2020. Some people had expressed openly that it would be a positive economic growth of about 1%; that is highly unlikely. This will continue over to 2021, 2022, and 2023. Most probably, we might recover into the positive range only after we arrive at, perhaps, 2024.”  

 He said that immediate steps must be taken to mitigate the damage and force an economic turnaround.  

 “That is why we need immediate measures to kick-start the economy. Everything will depend on what kind of policy measures we are going to introduce. Immediately, since we have lost the export market, we have to basically depend on the domestic market and our problem is the domestic market is very small, so it cannot generate a very high economic growth, but it can help us overcome the current economic downturn. That is what is necessary. So, the domestic market can be used to overcome the present economic downturn but after we have come to that level, we have to move towards the medium-to-long-term policies which involve revamping Sri Lanka’s production for the export market.”  

 With regard to Sri Lanka’s agreement to borrow $ 500 million, Dr. Wijewardena asserted that it was a much-needed relief measure in terms of foreign reserves.  

 With regard to the apparel sector, Dr. Wijewardena pointed out that even before Covid-19 Sri Lanka’s apparel industry was facing issues due to technological advancements and stiff competition among Asian countries with cheaper labour.  

 “Even before Covid-19, Sri Lanka’s apparel sector was facing huge problems – one of which was the competition from Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Cambodia. The second issue is that the buyers in North America and Europe were setting up factories in their own countries or in countries close to them which they call ‘onshoring’ and ‘nearshoring’. When apparel is produced in Sri Lanka, it is called ‘offshoring’.”  

 He elaborated on the advantages of onshoring and nearshoring and its expected impact on the global apparel trade.  

 “Even before Covid-19, say around 2015, these countries had started setting up factories on their own land – the US, the UK, and Europe. This is called onshoring because they were benefitting from the automation of the apparel industry. Then comes nearshoring – this is the practice of setting up factories in countries near them, close to the market, so that the product can be delivered to the buyer within three days. For example, Europe was supplied by countries like Turkey, Yugoslavia, and Serbia while the US was supplied by countries like Mexico, Honduras, and Guatemala.  

 “So, we were facing a problem because when we produce a product it takes about 30 to 40 days for it to reach the final consumer. But if you have a factory in your own land or a country close to you, it can reach in three days. That is the disadvantage that we all are facing. The estimate was that by 2025, about 65% of the requirement of the global apparel market would be met by onshoring and nearshoring countries. This is because of automation. There is 3D manufacturing applicable to the garment industry now and you don’t need human beings to do things. Therefore, the cheap labour in developing countries is no more an obstacle to start their businesses in their own countries.”  

 Meanwhile, the Export Development Board (EDB) confirmed that it was too early to ascertain the impact of the new Covid-19 cluster on the export industry.    

 “It’s difficult to tell at this point because it depends on how fast we can get this situation under control, how fast the businesses can be fully operational, and also the severity of the situation,” EDB Chairman Prabhash Subasinghe told  The Sunday Morning .  

 He said the containment and management of the new outbreak would greatly determine the level of impact on the apparel sector.  

 “Even with the apparel sector, we can’t make an assessment right now. We are too early in this issue. There are two issues when we talk about how this is going to impact industries. One is how serious the virus is and how many people it is impacting and whether it is escalating. The second is how long it will take for us to manage the situation. I think the Government is very strong in managing the situation but we don’t have enough information to make any more remarks on the matter.”  

 He said the Government is taking all steps to manage the outbreak while also ensuring smooth operations of economic activities by taking measures like local lockdowns and curfews instead of imposing it islandwide.  

 “With this new cluster, we have to wait for at least two weeks to one month to know what the ground situation is. Is it only in the Gampaha District? Is it controlled in the Gampaha District? We cannot forecast anything right now. The issue is not the company itself but the matter of it affecting a key industry, and now it appears to be affecting multiple industries. There will be an impact. We just don’t know what level of impact it will be. We are trying to minimise the impact by having business continuity and having only local lockdowns and local quarantine areas instead of locking down the entire country.”  ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,"Exports sector : Bracing for impact, ready to rise",focus,0,1602992807,0,101497,,
,,Unpaid caretakers  : The forgotten woman?,focus," By Pujanee Galappaththi   

 “I work every day from 5 a.m. until about 10 p.m. I wake up in the morning, cook for everyone, send them off to work and school, clean, wash clothes, cook dinner, and take care of my parents. This is all just a simple load of work that I am responsible for every day. The rest of my family helps me out with all this work, although it is only my responsibility,” shared Priyanka Perera, a homemaker since 2016.

 Perera used to work as an insurance executive for 25 years. “During that time too I used to cook, clean, take care of my children, parents, and take care of every member of my family along with my day job. My mother used to say being a woman is a full-time job and I did not fully understand this until I got a family of my own. I do everything I do with utmost love and care for my family and there is not a single thing I would not do, although I believe considering everything I do simply to be my responsibility as a woman, is diminishing the long hours of labour I put in.”  

 The majority of Sri Lankan women perform an overwhelming amount of duties and tasks for their families on a daily basis, only to be underappreciated, as they are considered to be simply carrying out their responsibilities or fulfilling their gender roles. 

Dr. Harini Amarasuriya

 In her maiden speech in Parliament in September 2020, Sri Lankan academic and human rights activist MP Dr. Harini Amarasuriya addressed the issue of unpaid caretakers and the unpaid care economy in Sri Lanka.  

 She stressed that every woman plays a significant role in her home – preparing food, caring for children, caring for the elderly, the sick, people with special needs, and so on and this categorises them as unpaid caretakers.   

 In order to discuss the concept of unpaid caretakers in Sri Lanka, its socioeconomic impact, as well as legal and policy restrictions,    The Sunday Morning    reached out to Dr. Amarasuriya this week.  
The unpaid care economy in Sri Lanka
 When asked about the definition of unpaid caretakers, Dr. Amarasuriya stated that unpaid care work ranges from anything done in reference to reproductive health, cooking, cleaning, caretaking of the sick and elderly, etc.  

 “Whether they get paid or not, this work is done without pay and society considers it the role and responsibility of women. Although some women do this work as a job, it is unrecognised, unregulated, and often not covered by any labour legislation,” she added.   

 We asked Dr. Amarasuriya how unpaid care work impacts the economy of a country, to which she said that this work done on a daily basis by almost all women in our country does not have a price to it, although it has a cost; if this work does not get done, it will have an effect on the other functions of the economy. This is how it will impact the economy in the long run.  

 Speaking of the further impact of the labour participation rate, Dr. Amarasuriya added that Sri Lanka has one of the lowest female labour participation rates in the world and this is mainly due to the fact that caretaking is not considered actual work. It is not counted into the census of labour.   

 Further, she added that most care work is done by women; as a result of this, even if they work, they have to do the additional work as well, so they have this triple burden. She further added that as a result of this, women are meant to work longer hours and the majority of the work they do does not technically amount to labour. This in turn affects the career choices women make, to take up challenges and risks, etc. holding a powerful profession would require a woman to balance her house work, family responsibilities, and her career and while only women are expected to partake in this balancing act, their careers are often compromised, which results in the low labour force participation of women.  

 The other main issue in reference to the economy according to Dr. Amarasuirya is that due to the lack of recognition of this work and the diminished value attached to it, they do not get the support they might require.  

 “When it is recognised as a problem, there can be policy changes made to assist, support, and sustain them. There are only about 10 state-funded elders’ homes. We need to put more money into these things – eldercare, childcare, welfare centres. However, everything starts from recognition.”   

 We further asked Dr. Amarasuriya how this change in society in order to recognise caretakers can be achieved, to which she said, this can be achieved via awareness, education, taking responsibility, and facilitating gender division at home.   

 “This is obviously a time-consuming task but that does not mean it is impossible. It is not a difficult concept to grasp. It boils down to taking care of each other's families, taking responsibility for each other. This is not inherently a woman’s responsibility but is inherently a human responsibility. This shift in thinking needs to be achieved and once it is, putting a support system in place is not rocket science,” she added.  
Recommendations
Sepali Kottegoda

  The Sunday Morning    reached out to women's rights activist and Women and Media Collective Technical Advisor on Women's Economic Rights and Media Sepali Kottegoda to find out how she thinks a systematic change can be achieved in society in reference to the unpaid caretaker problem.   

 Kottegoda stated that changes could be achieved with three simple steps – recognise, reduce, redistribute.   

 Recognise, according to Kottegoda, is to simply recognise care work as actual work of value. This includes expanding the definition of labour to include the 85% of all household chores taken on at home.   

 Referring to care work being recognised as work of value, Kottegoda said: “Many years ago, I asked a Samurdhi beneficiary   why it (a Samurdhi loan) is in the name of a man when it is the women who will be participating, and she said that it is because women are just staying at home. This is the notion that is there in our society; that the work women do at home is not significant. They are not significant enough to be included in the labour participation rate. This is the problem. This social stigma should be changed. This work should be recognised and given value. This was, for example, done in Bangladesh; so, it is achievable. If women at home stop working for a week, every other aspect of the economy will be halted and we will feel the impact it has on our economy.”  

 After the first step of recognition, the second step, reduce, refers to providing support, considering care work in the process of policy making, facilitating support services and support advice, and providing community facilities, etc., thus reducing the burden on women.  

 Thirdly, redistribution refers to the redistribution of this work within the home, and in turn, within the society. This makes it everyone’s responsibility, not just women’s. There was a time when we were told that women cannot drive tractors and we have come a long way since then, so we are capable of achieving this change; it is just a little time consuming.

,,Gratien Amerasinghe : The definition of the word ‘allrounder’,sports," By Malinda Seneviratne 

 Allrounder. It’s a word that cricketers and cricket fans know. There are batsmen. There are bowlers. Batsmen and bowlers are also fielders. And then we have allrounders. Back in the day there were allrounders, but now there are batting allrounders and bowling allrounders; the former are specialists with the bat who can turn their arm and the latter are specialists with the ball who can be counted on to put runs on the board. 

 And so, the statisticians rank cricketers (in all formats) – we get the top batsmen, the top bowlers, and the top allrounders. They stretch it to include captains, teams, and umpires too. 

 This is about allrounders. Sorry, it is about AN allrounder and one for whom cricket was just one of many things. The word, really, is about multiple skills, ideally excellent skills overall. One could be great at sports and at studies. One could be really good in many sports. And it doesn’t have to be about sports either. 

 Our man, however, was a sportsman. Gratien Amerasinghe.  

Gratien Amerasinghe as a schoolboy in 1953

 He was the eldest in a family of two girls and two boys. Born in Rajagiriya to a landed proprietor and a housewife, Gratien attended Carey College, Colombo. 

 These days it is rare for any schoolboy or schoolgirl to be involved in more than one sport. The training regimens are simply forbidding. You do one thing and you just don’t have time for another. Even if you did, you might be good at one but average at best in another discipline. Therefore if anyone got school colours, say, for two sports, he or she would be thought of as especially gifted. 

 Now consider Gratien. He represented his school in athletics, badminton, swimming, hockey, cricket, basketball, tennis, soccer, and boxing. He secured the Senior School Certificate in Science, was a school prefect, and won the medal for the Best Allround Student at Carey in 1955. He was the first schoolboy to represent the country at soccer. He was the Treasurer of the Senior Literary and Dramatic Association and had even taken part in theatre productions! 

 He loved sports, obviously. That love didn’t wane after leaving school. He would represent Sri Lanka at soccer and came close to boxing for his country at the Olympiad. He would end up coaching gymnastics, swimming, basketball, badminton, soccer, and boxing to students in many schools and also held various posts in several sports associations at the national level. Gratien still sports a blazer with the following legend: “Sri Lanka Boxing 1952, Sri Lanka Schools Cricket 1954, Sri Lanka Football XI 1955, Sri Lanka Basketball 1959, Manager Sri Lanka FFSL 1979.” 

 Now 85 years old, living in Boralesgamuwa with his son Sumith, Gratien recounted an incident which exemplifies his love for sport. He had at one point represented Nava Lanka Sports Club, Kollupitiya, which was funded by K.J. Haramanis Appuhamy. The old man’s two sons were the captain and vice captain of the team. Gratien was the goalie. It was their sister Seelawathi who Gratien married. 

 In fact when Gratien, as a 19-year-old, was picked for training squad ahead of the Asian Quadrangular Tournament in 1955, the    Ceylon Observer    ran a story about him where it is mentioned that Haramanis Appuhamy “one of Ceylon’s keenest soccer fans” had discovered the boy while he was representing Carey in an inter-school match! That article (written by “a ‘junior news’ sports reporter”) has the telling headline, “His punch is as good as your kick!” The reporter touched on his versatility but also describes him as “a simple, unassuming lad who has no time for hobbies”. His books, the reporter wrote, “and the five branches of sports he is interested in take up all his time”. 

 He did have time to fall in love and get married too. Just about enough, as it turned out to be! 

 “There was an international match the day after the wedding and sports correspondents in newspapers expressed doubt about me taking part. I went straight to the Sugathadasa Stadium immediately after the wedding!” 

Now 85 years old, Gratien is living in Boralesgamuwa

 He recalled how he missed an opportunity to represent the country at the Olympics as a boxer. He had lost to Dharmasiri Weerakoon at the nationals, which was essentially a pre-Olympic selection event. It had been a sad moment. 

 The happy times clearly outweighed the disappointments. He recounted how women’s basketball was launched in Sri Lanka. 

 A coach from India named Misra, who Gratien had met during a tour to that country at a time when he was the Secretary of the Sri Lanka Basketball Association, had written to him asking whether to bring down a women’s basketball team. 

 “I wrote back, asking him to bring them, even though we didn’t have a team. The Indian team was received by Maj. Gen. Cyril Ranatunga. Dr. P.R. Anthonis, my mother’s cousin, hosted them for dinner.’ 

 How about the team or rather the absence of a team? 

 “I got the netball team and taught them the fundamentals. The match was played at the Central YMCA and our team won!” 

 “Simple and unassuming”, is what he is, even now. He recalls the good times with a smile. He mentions but nudges aside the not-so-good moments. He doesn’t want to talk about them and I shouldn’t either. 

 He kept coming back to one thing. The secret of his versatility or rather the fitness that allowed him to do all that he did. Basketball.  

 “You have to be very fit. It’s second only to ice hockey when it comes to speed.” 

 He doesn’t have any cholesterol or sugar issues. He is fit for his age. He is clear in mind when talking about what he loved most. Sports. 

 To put things in perspective again; imagine a present-day first-class cricketer also playing soccer. Imagine a schoolboy cricketer who also represents his school in swimming, basketball, athletics, and soccer, or just a couple of sports. Imagine such an individual either representing the country or being in contention for a national call. Now multiply that by three or four. That’s Gratien Amerasinghe or rather a rough estimate of how versatile a sportsman he was.

,,Protests are a blessing for Murali movie!,sports," By Revatha S. Silva 

 Release of the “motion poster” itself of the Muttiah Muralitharan biopic    800    last week has created a huge uproar in Tamil Nadu, India. That will indirectly be for the huge advantage of the movie, mainly regarding its pre-production propaganda, our sources in Tamil Nadu revealed on Friday (16). 


 “The protests that have erupted here can give the film an extra mileage with regard to its propaganda long before its screening,” a journalist attached to one of the leading newspapers in Tamil Nadu told    The Sunday Morning Sports   . 
Covert propaganda?
When asked if the protests that have cropped up in the South Indian State are a covert part of movie propaganda, he, who talked on the condition of anonymity, did not deny the point outright. 

 “It may be the case. Anyway, people will go to watch it in numbers when it is released probably next year. A movie involving the life of a cricketer can always be a huge crowd-puller in this part of the country. If the film can impress the first round of viewers, then it can be a super hit,” he added. 
 'ShammeonVijaySethupathi' 
 Tamil cinema hero Vijay Sethupathi has already been painted a traitor of the Tamils for playing the world’s highest wicket-taker Muralitharan’s life. Why? Muralitharan, though being a Tamil himself emerging from the Central Hills in Sri Lanka with an Indian ancestry, is considered in Tamil Nadu as an “anti-Tamil”. 

 Troubles erupted last week after the motion poster of    800    – 800 is the number of Test wickets the off-spinner has taken, which is considered a world record difficult to be shattered – was released. It has evoked strong protests from pro-Tamil groups in Tamil Nadu with the social media platform Twitter exploding with the hash-tag “ShammeonVijaySethupathi”. 
 'I don't lose your love' 
 “The film depicts Murali’s struggle as a Tamil kid from the tea estate of the island nation’s central region of Kandy amidst a civil war between the nation’s Tamil rebels (from the North and East) and the Sinhala-majority government,” one media report emerging in India said last week. 

 It further added: “When the film was announced last year with Sethupathi as the lead, there were loud protests claiming that Murali was a supporter of the Rajapaksa Government accused of genocide of Tamils during the final stages of its war against the LTTE in 2009. At that time, Sethupathi had declared that the film would not portray anything that would hurt Tamils since ‘I would not like to lose the support of the people who love me’.” 
 Wearing the Lion t-shirt
 Tuesday reignited the controversy with Tamil activists recalling Murali's pro-Rajapaksa comments and his support for the military action against the LTTE. 

 “Many of them questioned how Sethupathi could wear the white t-shirt with the Sri Lankan flag embossed on it ‘since it stood for a government that massacred Tamils’. Social media was flooded with similar messages, urging Sethupathi to pull out from the film. The return of the Rajapaksa brothers as President and Prime Minister has also fuelled the controversy,” one news report stressed. 
Depicting start of July riots? 
 The Tamil film is to be shot in Sri Lanka, India, the UK, and Australia from next year and it will be released by the end of 2021. It will also be dubbed in all South Indian languages as well as Hindi, Bengali, and Sinhalese. An international version with English subtitles is also being planned. 

 The motion poster release last week depicts drawings of war scenes and explosions. Interestingly, one such scene depicts gunmen attacking a bus. Tamil Nadu media has taken it as a depiction of the infamous LTTE shootout of a bus carrying Lankan soldiers that sparked the 1983 anti-Tamil riots.

,,Who is your ‘GOAT’? : The never-ending ‘Federer-Nadal-Djokovic’ argument,sports," Any argument regarding the question “who is the greatest of all time’ (or GOAT)” is a very fraught one. This is fraught with dangers from all sides because of the fact that no two eras can really be compared with each other. Statistics are sometimes meaningless in this context. That is because they sometimes do not tell the whole story of such different eras. The statistics only show raw numbers. They do not show the competitiveness of an era when it is compared to another. 

 What this writer believes is that in such a discussion, it is better to compare stats of only one era among the players who played in that particular era. The historians as well as fans can have their own opinion. They may have their own say in this tricky “GOAT argument”, according to their own preferences. 
  We'll focus on the three greats  
 With that in mind, it is pertinent to discuss the achievements of the three greatest of the present era: Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic. Such a discussion will have a special significance this particular week as Nadal went on to win the French Open men’s singles championship with a predominant display over Djokovic in the final, thereby winning his 20th Grand Slam title in the process to equal the number of “Slams” won by Federer. 

 The following will be a statistical outlook on those three players. This writer is not going to profess any opinion regarding who is better than the other two. The readers themselves can make up their own mind about the three greats after going through the stats themselves. One thing is for sure: There will be a wide variety of reasons as to why each reader has reached their own conclusion. 
  The Grand Slam record  
 The Grand Slam titles each of them have won make an interesting reading. The figures may also show the preference of each player to a particular surface – lawn (Wimbledon), clay (French Open), or hard (Australian and US Open). 
   Australian Open   
 Roger Federer: 2004, 2006 and 2007, 2010, 2017 and 2018 (6 titles) 

 Rafael Nadal: 2009 (1 title) 

 Novak Djokovic: 2008; 2011, 2012, and 2013; 2015 and 2016; 2019 and 2020 (8 titles) 
   French Open   
 Roger Federer: 2009 (1 title) 

 Rafael Nadal: 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008; 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014; 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 (13 titles) 

 Novak Djokovic: 2016 (1 title) 
   Wimbledon   
 Roger Federer: 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007; 2009; 2012; 2017 (8 titles) 

 Rafael Nadal: 2008, 2010 (2 titles) 

 Novak Djokovic: 2011, 2014 and 2015, 2018 and 2019 (5 titles) 
   US Open   
 Roger Federer: 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008 (5 titles) 

 Rafael Nadal: 2010, 2013, 2017, 2019 (4 titles) 

 Novak Djokovic: 2011, 2015, 2018 (3 titles) 
  The analysis  
 
           Federer and Nadal have won 20 Grand Slam titles each. Djokovic, who is younger than them, has won a total of 17 titles.  
           Another interesting stat here is that Djokovic and Nadal have played between each other more times than any other two players in the major or Grand Slam tournaments in men’s professional tennis. That number (56) has only been beaten by the rivalry in the 1980s and 1990s between two great women’s tennis champions, Chris Evert Lloyd and Martina Navaratilova  
           Therefore, the fans of both Federer and Nadal can argue that the two are “better” than the other – Djokovic – since each of them have won more Grand Slams than Djokovic  
           Federer fans can argue that 13 of Nadal’s 20 titles have come at only one venue, the Roland Garros where French Open is held. Therefore, Federer is better than Nadal  
           Nadal fans can counter-argue that since he has won 13 of his titles at the French Open, which is often considered the most difficult Grand Slam out of the four, Nadal should be considered the best  
           Then, as is evident through the stats below, Djokovic fans have another counter-argument against the points mentioned above. This interesting stat is none other than the “head-to-head” record among the three players, which will add a very encouraging dynamic to the argument of the ardent Djokovic fans:  
 
  Djokovic vs. Federer: Djokovic leads 27-23  

  Djokovic vs. Nadal: Djokovic leads 29-27  

  Federer vs. Nadal: Nadal leads 24-16  
 
           Djokovic is younger than both Federer and Nadal and also, he has a better record against the latter two. Therefore, Djokovic fans can strongly argue that their one is the greatest  
 
  A never-ending argument  
 With such arguments and counter-arguments, points and counterpoints – though they are all good ones on all aspects – this GOAT discussion tends to become a never-ending one! 

 At the end of the day, what all fans need to remember – and rejoice, as the present writer believes – is the fact that everyone has to consider themselves fortunate to be living in an era where they could witness three great tennis players at their very height of prowess, dispensing supreme athleticism and entertainment that are bordering on almost superhuman status. 

 Just sit back and enjoy the ride while it lasts! Because when they are gone, everyone may regret not having enjoyed the three, no matter whom you considered the absolute “GOAT” out of them.

,,"Rook, line and sinker",sports," As the game of chess converged from its ancient Indian roots to the modern game we have today, the piece that represented Elephantry in  Chaturanga  evolved into the rook. Therefore, in most ancient and artistic chess sets, the rook is shaped like an elephant, a fitting symbol indeed for its supposedly straightforward character. 

 Not many chess players name the rook as their favourite piece. Rigid in appearance and direct in its movement, there is no real mystique about them. Just like the elephants, rooks are helpless when cramped for room, but in their element when given the elbow-room to use their muscles. But are they only about the brawn? There must be a reason that such a static figure plays a key role in a dynamic game such as chess. Let’s explore some of the rook-induced subtleties to appreciate the role they play. 

 One thing that tends to lessen the appeal of the rook is that there is a more powerful piece, the queen, that can do everything it can do and more. But there are certain exceptions when a rook is preferable, as illustrated in the famous Saavedra study. 


 White to play  
Conclusion of the Saavedra study  
 Here the natural 1.c8=Q would run into the crafty 1...Rc4+ 2.Qxc4 stalemate. A pleasing underpromotion solves the problem. 

 1.c8=R!   (threatening 1.Ra8+)   Ra4 2.Kb3   and now black loses the rook on a4 in view of the threatened Rc1#. 

 A rook loves to lord over an open file and do disciplined team work, especially when there is a colleague to push or pull him. Two such rooks are truly a tower of strength, and once they push and shove their way into the seventh rank, they are almost invincible. 
White to play and mate in two moves  
 The two white rooks dominate the opposition, yet the black knight stands strong to prevent incoming checkmates from all directions. How can you deliver a checkmate in a mere two moves? 

 1.Rhg7!   and black is in a zugzwang. The symmetry makes the solution of this ancient problem extra pleasing. 

 In the following example, if it were black to play, he would reach an easy draw by exchanging rooks. It is not at all obvious how white can change this verdict despite having the opportunity to move first. 

White to play and win  
 1.Re7+ Kh8 2.Kh6   (threatening 3.Rh7#)   Rge8   (2...Rgf8 3.Rh7+ Kg8 4.Rg1#)   and now the two rooks combine to create an unique face-off against their counterparts with   3.Rdd7! 


 ‘Face-off’ of rooks  
 In this picturesque position, black is completely helpless. The white king played an active role in helping the two brothers-in-arms emerge victorious and the white monarch plays an even prominent role in the following delightful problem. 


 White to play and win  
 1.Rg2+ Kf8   (1...Kh7 2.Rh1+). The rooks are ready to deliver the killer blow. The only issue is the unfortunate positioning of the white king. The two kings start to dance to the tune played by the white rooks. 

 2.Kg5+   (the white king zigzags his way to the safe g1 square)   Kg7 3.Kf4+ Kf6 4.Kg3+ Kg5 5.Kf2+ Kf4 6. Kg1+   and it’s all over. 

 Most of the fancy examples above are more the exception rather than the rule when it comes to the staunch behaviour of rooks. Although they might not be able to perform such clever tricks all the time, give them honest steamroller-work and you can safely rely on them. 

White to play and mate in four moves  
Composed by Gerhard Latzel  
 The white rook on a1 acts as a violent demolisher of walls as it fights its way from a1 to a8 in a mere four moves. 

 1. Rxa2   (threatening 2.Rxh2#. The recurring threat of moving the rook to the h-file is used to bulldoze the rook through the a-file)   Nb2 2.Rxa3 Nb3 3.Rxa6   3... Bb6 4.Ra8#. ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,"Rook, line and sinker",sports,0,1602996381,0,101526,,
,,Finch replaces Paine as Aus ODI captain,news,"Aaron Finch has replaced Tim Paine as Australia’s one-day international captain for the upcoming series against South Africa. Paine, Australia’s Test captain has been left out of the 50-over side, and Finch seems set to lead the side through to the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019. Josh Hazlewood, one of two Test vice-captains, will continue in the role, while Alex Carey, the wicket-keeper, was announced as the other vice-captain.  “We expect Aaron, Josh and Alex to lead the side through a big Australian summer, where we’ll meet South Africa and India,” said Trevor Hohns, Australia’s chairman of selectors. “They’ll also be driving our standards and values, as we prepare our defence of the World Cup, which is only seven months away. “Alex Carey will pull on the gloves full-time to allow Tim Paine to focus purely on captaining the Test team, which includes preparing for next year’s Ashes. Alex provides us with another strong batting option, as he displayed in last year’s Big Bash, and he’s a wonderful young leader to have around the group and out in the field.” Andrew Tye and Billy Stanlake, leading wicket-takers for Australia in the on-going T20 series against Pakistan, have been left out of the squad, with Pat Cummins and Hazlewood returning to the side after a long injury hiatus.  “Andrew Tye is unlucky to miss out. The return of Cummins, Hazlewood and Starc, unfortunately, meant there wasn’t enough room in the squad for another quick,” Hohns said. “D’Arcy Short has retained his spot in the side alongside Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis. D’Arcy was also outstanding with the bat in the JLT Cup, combined with his energy in the field and ability to come on and bowl leg-spins he’s an extremely versatile member of the squad.” Nathan Lyon and Mitchell Marsh, the Test vice-captain, have been rested with an eye on the fast-approaching World Cup, while Marcus Stoinis, who was left out of the T20Is against Pakistan, has managed to keep his place in the ODIs. “We have made the decision to manage Mitch Marsh and Nathan Lyon carefully, to ensure they are in the best condition possible to put their hand up for selection, either later in the summer or for the World Cup next year,” Hohns added.  “We have included two spin bowlers in the squad, Ashton Agar and Adam Zampa, and we’re looking forward to seeing who can grab the opportunity against South Africa.” The three-match ODI series between Australia and South Africa will begin at Perth on Sunday, 4 November.

,,Pakistan target clean-sweep,news,"Australia will have to find a quick-fix to their top-order problems, if they are to take out a consolation victory against Pakistan in the final T20I today (28). Australia were a lot better in the second T20I in Dubai after enduring a disaster in the first game – they were bowled out for 89 chasing 156 – but it still wasn’t enough to keep Pakistan from winning another T20I series – their 10th in succession. Australia’s batting has been an issue, especially on slower wickets. Despite Glenn Maxwell’s 52, Australia still faltered in a modest chase of 147 after the top three managed just 12 runs between them. After the debacle in the first game, Aaron Finch said he had to shoulder the responsibility for Australia’s failure at the top. However, he was unable to turn things around in the second ODI, falling for a 10-ball 3. D’Arcy Short and Chris Lynn didn’t get past single-digit scores either. Mitchell Marsh managed to get a partnership going with Maxwell, and as one of the more established members of the side, he’ll want to lead the way today. Maxwell’s knock, meanwhile, was the one bright spot for Australia, and his ability against spin will come in handy in the final T20I. Meanwhile Pakistan’s bowling seems to be getting stronger by the day, with youngsters like Shaheen Afridi and Shadab Khan coming to the party. Imad Wasim, in particular, has been extra-ordinary. He followed up his four-for in the first game with a miserly spell of 4-1-8-1 in the second. That said, in the bowling department, Australia too have looked solid. Nathan Coulter-Nile, who seemed like the only weak-link in the first game, turned things around completely to take 3/18, and his exploits were instrumental in restricting Pakistan. Coulter-Nile has also been impressive with the bat, and that bodes well for Australia. He could go a long way towards adding batting depth to the Australian limited-overs side, and they will hope to see further evidence of his all-round abilities today. Their bowlers will look to exploit Pakistan’s weakness with the bat. Only Babar Azam and Mohammad Hafeez have made major contributions so far. If Australia can dismiss one of them early, they could restrict Pakistan to an even lower total. Pakistan needs their seniors, like Shoaib Malik and Sarfraz Ahmed, to guide by example in the middle-order. Lower down, Ashraf, who has been excellent with the ball in his short international career so far, has been less than impressive with the bat. He will want to get into the skin of a true all-rounder.   ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Pakistan target clean-sweep,news,0,1540651875,0,10156,,

,,Gift a pad with Selyn: A sustainable zero waste solution to female sanitation,brunch," 
By Dimithri Wijesinghe   

 
On the International Day of Rural Women (15) – a day to recognise rural women's participation in development while focusing on their needs and rights – the Selyn Foundation launched its brand-new initiative of reusable fabric sanitary napkins by Selyn. 

 Selyn has launched a product where with every purchase, they will match their customers’ purchase one to one and donate a reusable napkin to women who are unable to afford menstrual hygiene supplies in rural Sri Lanka. Additionally, 5% of sales proceeds will be given to support outreach activities to raise awareness on menstrual hygiene among communities in the Kurunegala District, to start with; they have partnered The Arka Initiative to conduct these sessions and they hope this can build the needed trust to engage in more difficult conversations on topics affecting the physical and mental wellbeing of women. 

Selyn Foundation Project Manager Kavindi Bandara

 Selyn Foundation Project Manager Kavindi Bandara shared with us that the primary reason for the project was to remedy the current climate in Sri Lanka with regards to female sanitary products like sanitary pads. 

 It is estimated that approximately 40% of Sri Lankan women use sanitary napkins while the others opt to use cloth and old rags due to these products being too expensive and inaccessible. In addition, the social stigma surrounding menstruation means that women and girls avoid school/work during their period due to this reason. In addition, since they use cloth and utilise unclean methods to manage their period, vaginal infection is rampant among women in rural areas. 

 She stated that the product is 100% Sri Lankan made, and how they source the product is through the Selyn Foundation, which employs direct labour including those who work in manufacturing outlets under Selyn and also independent home workers from rural communities who contribute from home. For this particular project, they utilise both types of labour, Bandara shared. 

 The product is priced (large, Rs. 950 and medium, Rs. 750) in the concept of “buy one and gift one”, meaning the price is inclusive of an additional reusable napkin that will be gifted to the needy by the purchaser. “For every pad you purchase, the Selyn Foundation will match it as a gift,” she said, adding that the intention was so those in rural communities would not have to purchase it; what they wish to do is to introduce a sustainable and zero waste solution to female sanitation for those who cannot afford it. 

 She stated that the response has been incredibly positive, with their products being sold out within the first 24 hours of the launch; they have even had many men purchasing the product in order to gift the product to those who may need it in rural communities. 

 Bandara also provided that the way they make these donations is also significant due to their partnership with The Arka Initiative; in reaching out to communities of women in rural areas, they carry out awareness programmes to supplement their distribution. She said that they not only educate the women on their menstrual health but also create awareness on reproductive health and a variety of other women’s issues, from legal protection to their rights. 

 As this was their soft launch, they are yet to estimate figures to go by in terms of projections in savings, however they do guarantee 60 months of use for the product. They also advised buying two large and three medium pads, which would last five years. 

 Bandara added that they hope to grow this venture as they take into consideration customers and their feedback to expand on the products they have. She said that they are currently looking into developing a solution to create baby diapers and panty liners as well, and those products would definitely be next in line.

,,The future is equal: British Council commemorates the International Day of the Girl Child,brunch," 
By Naveed Rozais 

 11 October marks the International Day of the Girl Child. British Council Sri Lanka hosted a live webinar to commemorate the occasion featuring a conversation with social anthropologist and UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) Assistant Representative Madu Dissanayake. 

 Dissanayake is a social anthropologist with over 18 years of experience and expertise in her field. Dissanayake holds a postgraduate diploma in international relations, a diploma in health promotion, a diploma in early years education, and a certificate in sexuality and sexual health from the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV. Her career has revolved around policy, social and behavioural change communication, public health, and gender and human rights. 

 Dissanayake shared that the 2020 theme for the International Day of the Girl Child is “my voice for our equal future”, with a call to action to young people to join this conversation and entry points where they can create positive changes in their societies. 

 2020 marks 25 years since the formation of the Beijing Platform for Action, the most progressive blueprint ever for advancing women’s rights, which discusses and treats women’s rights as human rights. In the 25 years since its inception, much progress has been made in the field of women’s rights. Health and education gender gaps, for example, are closing and are nearly on par, Dissanayake shared. 

UNFPA Assistant Representative Madu Dissanayake in conversation with the moderator for the webinar Mrinali Thalgodapitiya

 However, political and economic empowerment gaps remain quite large. Twenty percent of women are still illiterate in 44 countries. Globally, only 18% of women hold ministerial positions, and only 24% of parliamentarians worldwide are women. Out of 149 countries, only 17 heads of state are women. From the global workforce, only 34% of women hold managerial positions. 

 Violence against women is a huge global issue. Globally, one in three women is physically and sexually violated. The prevalence data of gender-based violence is not yet available in Sri Lanka, but women in Sri Lanka do face violence, not just privately, but in public spaces and public transport as well. 

 For an equal future, all these issues need to be addressed. Dissanayake shared the most crucial entry points where youths can get involved and affect positive change. 

 For equality to be achieved, women need to be able to practice equal bodily autonomy, where they are able to decide what happens to their bodies and who gets to touch them. Women need equal access to employment and political participation. Only 34% of Sri Lanka’s women are part of the workforce, and out of Sri Lanka’s 225-member Parliament, only 13 are women. Women also need to be entitled to equal pay. 

 Women also need equality before the law, where women hold all the same legal rights as men. Sri Lanka’s laws haven’t changed to suit our current situation, with women facing many discriminations within the legal system. 

 Dissanayake shared that there are many ways change can be created, especially with youth involvement. There are 1.8 billion 15 to 24-year-olds globally, over 50% of whom are female, all of whom can take action by speaking out against discrimination when they see it by studying these issues, understanding the gravity of it, and spreading the word and slowly shifting the cultures in which they live, thereby creating positive impact that moves away from established stereotypes, toxic masculinity, and patriarchy. 

 A huge part of shifting culture is through embracing multiple narratives and unlearning established behaviours. Dissanayake encouraged young people to read and research different perspectives and sources when thinking about issues; to look at things from different perspectives like the neuroscientific perspective, the psychological perspective, the sociological perspective, and the anthropological perspective, and to bring these conversations up at home and in day-to-day life, and be willing to have difficult conversations that challenge how you and those around you view the world. 

 Dissanayake also stressed the importance of supporting survivors because while we can create conversations on prevention, discrimination and violence still happens and it is vital to have support services that allow victims to heal and grow. 

 Dissanayake ended the discussion by noting that change doesn’t come overnight; it is about visualising the future and using our passion to help make that future possible. In the worlds of Mahatma Gandhi, “you must be the change you wish to see in the world”.

,,Establishment of FCID : RW admits gazette was illegal,news,"Former Prime Minister (PM) Ranil Wickremesinghe gave a nonchalant response when it was put to him that the Inspector General of Police (IGP) did not have the power to establish the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) under the Yahapalana Government.

 He thus considered that the FCID was in fact illegal, when he appeared before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) probing alleged incidents of political victimisation. 

 He appeared at the FCID with regard to a complaint filed by former Department of Divineguma Additional Director General and present Department of Samurdhi Director General Bandula Thilaksiri. 

 During the proceedings, the cabinet paper pertaining to the “Anti-Corruption Committee Secretariat” was brought to the attention of the former PM by the legal counsel representing the complainant. 

 The legal counsel said that the cabinet paper had given guidance on setting up a police unit, to the ministerial secretary. He however made evident that the gazette notification pertaining to the establishment of the FCID had not been issued by the ministerial secretary, but rather the IGP. 

 In response, the former Premier said that the relevant power lies with the IGP. 

 Afterwards, the legal counsel of the complainant quoted Section 55 of the Police Ordinance and emphasised that the IGP does not have power to establish a separate unit. 

 To that Wickremesinghe replied: “They say the IGP can establish police divisions. But our cabinet paper does not mention the establishment of divisions, and only mentions the establishment of a secretariat pertaining to corruption.” 

 The Chairman of the Commission then made evident that the IGP had established a unit exercising a power he does not have. 

 Former PM Wickremesinghe responded: “I don’t know about that. I remember they reported that the secretary doesn’t have the power to do it and only the IGP had the power to do it.” 

 The legal counsel of the complainant then made evident that though the gazette says that the FCID was established under Section 55 of the Police Ordinance, that particular section of the Ordinance does not accord such a power. 

 The response of the witness was: “If there isn’t power, there isn’t.”

 The HRCSL was requested to look into this matter in order to prevent the violation of human rights of apparel factory workers during the pandemic situation.

,,MS on Easter attacks at PcoI : Pujith and Hemasiri accused of lying,news," Former President Maithripala Sirisena appeared yet again before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) probing the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks on Saturday (17) and rejected the allegation that he attempted to make the former Inspector General of Police (IGP) the scapegoat following the massacre. 

 Former President Sirisena also rejected the testimony of former Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando where he had said he was asked by the Head of State not to attend the meeting chaired by then Prime Minister (PM) Ranil Wickremesinghe in the immediate aftermath of the attacks. 

 The former President insisted that his instructions were in fact to work together. 

 Sirisena was asked by the Additional Solicitor General at the PCoI whether it wasn’t wrong to not appoint an Acting Minister of Defence when he left the country on 16 April 2019, especially in the backdrop of intelligence units reporting on the incidents of vandalism of Lord Buddha statues in Mawanella, discovery of explosives in Wanathawilluwa, and Zahran Hashim’s Jihadi ideologies. 

 The witness responded: “Though those incidents had happened by the time I left the country, no one had warned of an act of terrorism within the country. Since 2015, I had given instructions on what measures needed to be taken on extremism. 

 “This information wasn’t first received on 20 April. This foreign intelligence was received before that. If I wasn’t in the country, the President’s Secretary could have been informed; had that happened, he would have notified me instantly. The error here is not informing; even the documentation on imposing emergency regulations is handled by the President’s Secretary.” 

 When the Commissioner asked the former President whether internal issues within the Government, prevalent during his tenure, played a part in officials being reluctant to make decisions, the former President rejected the notion. 

 The Additional Solicitor General then put to the witness that evidence had been submitted that the witness had instructed the President’s Secretary, the Defence Secretary, and other officers to refrain from attending the meeting PM Wickremesinghe had called when the initial blasts happened on 21 April. The Additional Solicitor General therefore asked former President Sirisena as to why he gave such instructions. 

 The former President replied: “No, I did not give such instructions. What I said was to work together.” 

 When the Additional Solicitor General asked whether he took measures over his instructions not being followed, the former President said that the question arises as to how many state officials would be left if action was taken against their dereliction of duty, weaknesses, and mistakes. 

 The Additional Solicitor General asked the witness whether he would accept if he said that Zahran sank and Namal Kumara rose after the portfolio of Law and Order was taken over by the witness. 

 To that, former President Sirisena replied: “I, in no way, accept that statement, since a person called Namal Kumara was not even discussed at the National Security Council (NSC). I don’t know, have not seen, or spoken with a person called Namal Kumara.” 

 When the Additional Solicitor General asked the witness whether he told former IGP Pujith Jayasundara that even the Malalgoda Committee Report would be altered if the IGP took responsibility over the failure to prevent the attacks, former President Sirisena said: “That’s an utter lie.” 

 The Additional Solicitor General then asked the witness: “If evidence has been submitted before the Commission saying that the Easter Sunday attacks happened because the National Security Council did not give due attention to acting against extremism, would you accept it?” 

 Sirisena replied: “No, I reject it completely. What has happened here is that relevant sections have not acted on the received information, not enacting the instructions given over the years. They have not reported anything on such an attack. The Navy Intelligence operated strongly in the Eastern areas, but no one updated me on the dry run the terrorists did on 16 April where they blew up a motorcycle in the area of Thalankuda.”

           Loss of Rs. 1 b annually to RDA  
           Loss of only source of income for RDA  
 
 By Maheesha Mudugamuwa    

 Trade unions attached to the Road Development Authority (RDA) have raised concerns over the cabinet decision to set up a new company to manage expressways and establish the existing Expressway Operations Division and all the expressway construction projects as a separate company under the General Treasury. 

 In a letter written to Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Road Development Employees Union (RDEU) stressed there was a serious concern among the employees that the RDA may lose nearly Rs. 1 billion in annual earnings from investments. 

 They also stressed that as a result, the RDA would not be able to pay the salaries and other benefits of the employees as usual. 

 “The maintenance of the national highway system and the construction of new highways have been statutorily entrusted to the RDA since 1986 and while the RDA is fulfilling that responsibility, the revenue of the Expressway Operations Division has been established,” the letter stated. 

 RDEU President B.M.D.K. Bandaranaike stated: “The separation of the Expressway Operations Division from the authority will affect the payment of salaries and other benefits to the nearly 12,000 employees of the authority, and result in the loss of the only source of income for the authority to earn money for public work expenses.” 

 While vehemently opposing the proposal made by the PM, the RDEU has requested for the immediate withdrawal of the decision, and to maintain the authority as it is now.

,,Nalaka Godahewa,interviews,"By Skandha Gunasekara 
Senior financial advisor to the Rajapaksa camp, Dr. Nalaka Godahewa said that china would play a key role and asserted that the new government would take swift and decisive measures to stabilize the rupee and revitalize the economy.

Below are excerpts of his interview with  The Sunday Morning: 

 Q: What action plan does the new government have for the country’s economy? 

 A:  We will first stabilize the economy and give confidence to the business community and the investors. We will also give relief to the common man. That’s our key aim. Our plan will be worked out with that intention.

 Q: What will be the fate of the rupee? Will it be allowed to float or stabilized? 

 A:  The rupee has to be stabilized. However, this cannot be done overnight but we have a plan and we will implement it accordingly.

 Q: During such a tumultuous period, how will you manage investor confidence? 

 A:  I think investors will understand that the government that didn’t have a clue about managing the economy is no more, and that people who are far more confident in managing the economy have taken over the reins. Therefore, they must be already having confidence but we will do everything that is required to give them that confidence by having the right policy framework – avoiding this kind of inconsistent decision making and also making the investment environment more conducive. Those are the things that the investors want. We will work towards that. Building investor confidence is an utmost priority for us.

 Q: What do you plan to do about the high cost of living and tax burden on the people that is currently prevailing in the country? 

 A:  To start off, when the former Government came to power in 2015, within three-and-a-half years, they increased taxes by over 100%. That is a huge burden on the people and also the rupee. The rupee depreciation might take a little time for us to stabilize, because that cannot be done overnight; but we will definitely look at what we can do with regard to the heavy tax burden on the masses. A key objective of the government will be what we can do to provide some relief from the high taxation that is currently going on.

 Q: How will the stock markets be affected by these latest political developments? 

 A:  The stock markets will pick up. The poor regulation and the poor leadership of the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) was one of the biggest hindrances to the processes of the stock market. In 2014, our stock market was rated the best in Asia.

Such a stock market cannot come down like this unless something terribly went wrong. There are two key factors: One, is the overall economy of the country, which just kept coming down, the second one is that the people who were regulating it were not managing it properly.

They were creating chaos among investors because of their ad-hoc decisions. So we will look at changing this leadership as fast as possible and bring that confidence back to the investors in the stock market.

 Q: How long can this prorogation of Parliament continue without affecting the image of a stable Sri Lanka for tourism and investments? 

 A:  I don’t think it will have much of an effect. For the last three years in this country, nothing happened; so I don’t think another three years will make a difference. Right now, it will be for the stated time period. That is the President’s prerogative. I don’t think there is any reason to go beyond that. However, it is a political decision. That is something that the President must decide, and I don’t see a reason why it should be extended further.

 Q: Are you to be part of the team that will formulate a new Budget? 

 A:  Those issues have not been taken up yet because first of all, the Cabinet has to be appointed. I can’t comment on the Budget as such decisions have to be taken by government officials, and they have not been appointed yet. That will happen after the Cabinet is appointed.

 Q: Who will be taking over the Finance Ministry and the Treasury? 

 A:  I think in Prime Minister Rajapaksa’s team, there are many capable people who can do that – so he will select the right person.

 Q: What about the nation’s debt servicing and the upcoming debt bunching period in 2019 and 2020? 

 A:  That is something we have known for quite some time. We will find a solution. We don’t have to worry too much about it.

 Q: The Chinese Ambassador met with Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday; will your Government be looking for international financial support to manage the rupee? 

 A:  We have a plan, so let’s wait for it to be implemented. Not only the Chinese, but other ambassadors will also meet with Prime Minister Rajapaksa. Right now, he is the country’s Prime Minister, and all these other countries want to pledge their support; and the Chinese have always had a good relationship with him and are naturally upset about the speed at which things were happening in the past. So that was the purpose of this meeting – to renew that relationship. They will definitely play a key role; not just them, but a couple of neighboring countries too.",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Nalaka Godahewa,interviews,0,1540889276,0,10161,,
,,Monetary policy review : Only 50% chance of rate cut: FC Research,business," First Capital (FC) Research says there is a 50% possibility of a rate cut when the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) meets for its scheduled monetary policy review later this week. 

“Our previous pre-policy report had assigned a 60% probability for a rate cut in 20 October and 75% probability on 20 November. However, considering the improved macroeconomic indicators, we have reduced the probability of a rate cut by 10% to 50% on 20 October and by 25% to 50% on 20 November,” it said in its latest pre-policy analysis. 

 The following are the arguments for and against further relaxation in monetary policy FC Research highlights in the analysis report. 

 
  Arguments against further relaxation in monetary policy  
 Domestic financial conditions have eased substantially with banking system liquidity remaining in surplus – banks have abundant liquidity, following the CBSL infusing ample liquidity into the banking system via increased CBSL holdings (money printing). However, outlook for credit seems lacklustre given the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic. 

 Improvement in high-frequency indicators in the economy – recovery of manufacturing activities continued in August 2020 (Index Value 57.9) as reflected by PMI Manufacturing, benefitting from the normalisation of business activities in the country. PMI Services continued to expand for the third consecutive month with the index reaching 56.0 in August 2020. Additionally, the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) for July 2020 increased to 111.1 from 92.8 in June 2020. Political stability after the general election and a slow return to normalcy was depicted in the LMD-Nielsen Business Confidence Index (BCI) during June-September 2020 reflecting an improvement to 123 from 96. Domestic economic activities, which were adversely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, are expected to recover in Q4 of 2020, thus not requiring further relaxation in policies. 

 Credit to the private sector reflects a gradual normalisation of economic activities – private sector credit rebounded in August 2020 by Rs. 78.3 billion, for the first time since April 2020 reflecting the fact that both businesses and individuals are accelerating their economic activities to make up for the lost opportunities during the lockdowns period. 

 
  Arguments for further relaxation in monetary policy  
 GDP growth in 2020E is expected to remain in the negative territory – FC Research estimates that Sri Lanka’s GDP would see its steepest contraction in history of -5.8% in 2020 following the unexpected contraction in Q1 GDP growth of -1.6%. Amidst the lack of demand for credit, import restrictions, and the slowness in recovery of consumer demand, GDP growth is expected to turn positive only by Q4 of 2020. Accordingly, GDP growth can be considered as a major factor favouring the further policy easing at the upcoming review. 

 Consumer confidence remains muted with weak demand – the pandemic-led disruption has had a lasting impact on the income of individuals with businesses being shut and either lay-offs or pay cuts experienced by salaried professionals. The lower disposable income in the hands of consumers will have a bearing on the demand for consumption with discretionary spending being either deferred or cancelled for a period of time. However, higher credit growth and consumer demand can be aggravated through a further policy easing. 

 Government leans heavily on domestic sources of funding – FC Research expects Sri Lanka’s budget deficit in 2020 to reach 10% of GDP. Generally, fiscal deficit is funded via domestic and foreign sources of borrowing. Lack of foreign direct investment (FDI) and limited foreign borrowing options in the current period may push the Government to borrow predominantly from the domestic market. The decline in domestic interest rates in response to the aggressive monetary easing delivered the required support to soften the pandemic impact on the economy; thereby maintaining a low-interest rate environment or further reducing interest rates to benefit government finances. 

 FC Research noted that its previous pre-policy report proved accurate. 

 “In-line with our expectations, at the last policy meeting held in August 2020, CBSL maintained its accommodative monetary policy stance, particularly as market lending rates are yet to reflect the full passthrough of policy easing measures implemented thus far,” it said.

,,CAA to confiscate hoarded paddy,news," By Maheesha Mudugamuwa 

 The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) would confiscate hidden stocks of paddy and release it the market, as per the relevant provisions in the CAA Act. 

 CAA Chairman Maj. Gen. (Retd.) Shantha Dissanayake said that provisions for this have been made in the CAA Act. 

 However, large-scale paddy mill owners informed the Ministry of Trade that they cannot supply rice at the controlled price as the price of a kg of paddy had risen to Rs. 63. 

 As a result, the price of rice in the market has gone up, it is learnt.   

 Last week, the large-scale paddy mill owners pointed out that the price of rice can be reduced once the middlemen stop storing paddy. 

 The CAA launched a series of islandwide raids to find paddy stocks hidden by middlemen. At the raids, 11 million kg of paddy hidden in the Anuradhapura District was seized. ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,CAA to confiscate hoarded paddy,news,0,1603070629,0,101628,,

The Sri Lankan Ambassador to the Maldives, Major General (Rtd) A.B. Thoradeniya said that he expects some progress after 11 November. “We expect something positive to take place once the new President takes office,” he told  The Sunday Morning.  President Maithripala Sirisena recently sent former Minister Faiszer Musthapha to the Maldives as his special envoy to negotiate the release of Madushanka. Musthapha met Maldives President-elect Ibrahim Mohamad Solih and sought the release of Madushanka.

Three others arrested on 17 December, 2015 for allegedly hiring the Sri Lankan sniper were later released for lack of evidence.

,,Japanese study finds COVID-19 can survive upto 9 hours on human skin,news,"KYOTO -- The new coronavirus can survive on the surface of human skin for around nine hours, some five times the period influenza can, a team of researchers in Japan has found.

The researchers, including epidemiology specialist Ryohei Hirose, a research associate at Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, additionally found that if the new coronavirus is exposed to alcohol-based disinfectant or ethanol of the same concentration, the virus is deactivated within 15 seconds.

As a result, Hirose is calling for people to thoroughly wash their hands or use alcohol-based disinfectant.

The group's findings were published in the online edition of U.S.-based science journal ""Clinical Infectious Diseases"" on Oct. 3.

According to the group, when the new coronavirus and influenza A were applied to the surface of skin, the new coronavirus lasted for around nine hours on it, while the flu strain remained for about 1.8 hours. Both the coronavirus and the flu remained active over the periods. To ensure that test subjects were not infected by the virus, researchers used skin samples from a person whose body was donated for a medical autopsy.

The team also applied the viruses to surfaces more conducive to their survival, such as on stainless steel, heat-resistant glass and plastic. It was found that the new coronavirus stayed active on them for between around 58 and 85 hours, whereas influenza lasted between about six and 11 hours. In all instances, the new coronavirus survived far longer.

Furthermore, the team also investigated the efficacy of ethanol when used as an alcohol-based disinfectant. They used ethanol at an 80% concentration, the same as in alcohol-based disinfectants available for sale, and found that it completely neutralized both the new coronavirus and influenza virus within 15 seconds, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness as a disinfectant.

Hirose said, ""It appears that the relatively long time in which the new coronavirus can survive on human skin is among the background factors making it difficult to confirm infection routes. If it's staying active for nine hours, then it's difficult to prevent infections from touch. There's only so much that individual efforts can accomplish, so it's important not to blame people who do become infected.""(Mainichi.jp)

,,Supreme Court must decide: Ranga Kalansooriya,news," Quotes: My opinion is that it should be decided by the Supreme Court if the President’s actions are constitutional or not; but again, the President’s decision is a policy decision  The current situation is different from what was before 2015. The Yahapalana government has introduced positive legislation and there are international obligations as well. Basil Rajapaksa also said they would not change those positive changes brought by the Yahapalana government if they came into power  Not a single government in the world can achieve all the promises that they make; but the Yahapalana government, to some extent, fulfilled their promises. People expect more, and some says they could have done more  By Maheesha Mudugamuwa The Former Director General of the Government Information Department Dr. Ranga Kalansooriya, who played a key role in taking the message of the government of good governance forward, said that the new administration must ensure media freedom is upheld. Kalansooriya told  The Sunday Morning  that one of the issues with the government of good governance was that it delayed completing investigations into various allegations. Following are excerpts of the interview:     Q: What’s your reaction to the current political situation in Sri Lanka?  A: This is a unique situation. Now there are two opinions as some says President Maithripala Sirisena’s decision to appoint former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the new Prime Minister by removing Ranil Wickremesinghe from his post is constitutional while others say it is not. My opinion is that it should be decided by the Supreme Court if the President’s actions are constitutional or not; but again, the President’s decision is a policy decision. So we have to wait and see what the Supreme Court says about the issue.   Q: Do you think the ongoing investigations into the corruptions alleged to be taking place under the previous government will continue under the premiership of Rajapaksa?  A: That’s the question we all have in our minds right now. Usually, the investigations are conducted according to a political agenda and most of them have always been politicised. However, the Yahapalana government was able to achieve some developments in these investigations. I’m not trying to say that they have completed those investigations, but they took them to a far greater extent. The issue with the Yahapalana government was also the delay in completing these investigations. Now we don’t know what will happen to them.     Q: How do you compare the current political situation with 2015, when the President appointed Ranil Wickremesinghe as the PM, who did not have the majority in Parliament at that time?  A: We can’t compare these two situations, but up to some extent, we can compare the situation with what Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga did in 2004. Even though it was a general election, there are so many similarities between the two incidents. I’m not saying that those two situations were exactly the same but that is what happened to Ranil Wickremesinghe then and now.     Q: What can we expect from a government under the premiership of Rajapaksa?  A: All I can say is that the current situation is different from what was before 2015. The Yahapalana government has introduced positive legislation and there are international obligations as well.  Basil Rajapaksa also said they would not change those positive changes brought by the Yahapalana government if they came into power. So I hope that PM Rajapaksa will abide by those legislations and obligations as well. All we can do is wait and see.   Q: What do you think about the incidents reported about the state media institutions?  A: What I think is that they should not have happened. Media freedom should be upheld by any government in power whether it’s the state or private media. We expect that media freedom would be upheld by the government in the future as well.     Q: What do you think about the proposed impeachment motion against the President?  A: That should also be decided by the Supreme Court as it depend on whether President Sirisena’s conduct is constitutional or not. Therefore I can’t comment on that. The Supreme Court is the best place to decide it.     Q: Now there are two Prime Ministers. What are your thoughts?  A: That is what you all are saying. That is what people say and that is what Ranil Wickremesinghe says. Of course that should also be decided by the Supreme Court or Parliament. We can’t give classifications to that.   Q: Are you happy with the conduct of the Yahapalana government and its economic achievements?  A: Not a single government in the world can achieve all the promises that they make; but the Yahapalana government, to some extent, fulfilled their promises. People expect more, and some says they could have done more.  ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Supreme Court must decide: Ranga Kalansooriya,news,0,1540655278,0,10167,,

,,Indira Cancer Trust goes virtual this Breast Cancer Awareness Month,brunch," Breast cancer is one of the most frequent cancers to affect women. Globally, it affects approximately 2.1 million women each year. In Sri Lanka, breast cancer affects approximately 4,000 women each year. It is also one of the deadliest forms of cancer, accounting for 15% of all cancer-related deaths in women. 

 Awareness around breast cancer is essential, because in the majority of cases, early detection can make all the difference when it comes to getting effective treatment.  

 October is International Breast Cancer Awareness Month and sees breast cancer organisations and charities across the world launching campaigns that focus on breast cancer awareness and treatment of breast cancer.  

 The second wave of Covid-19 infections to hit Sri Lanka in early October has caused a dramatic shift in how we would mark Breast Cancer Awareness Month. With this in mind, breast cancer awareness and support organisation Indira Cancer Trust, in partnership with Colombo City Running, the Triathlon Club Colombo, and Colombo Night Run has embraced a virtual campaign in honour of Breast Cancer Awareness Month 2020.  

 The flagship of Indira Cancer Trust’s virtual activities for Breast Cancer Awareness Month 2002 is the Virtual Pink Walk/Run/Cycle event. Taking place entirely virtually, the Virtual Pink Walk/Run/Cycle is a platform within which participants can register online and then go on to do the activity of their choice (walking, running, or cycling), wherever they feel most comfortable, recording themselves through the fitness, running, or cycling app that they use on a daily basis. Once their activity is complete, participants only need to share their pink photo and activity details with the Indira Cancer Trust (through the appropriate link provided).  

 The Virtual Pink Walk/Run/Cycle event has received an outpouring of support with over 200 registrations and counting across 15 countries spanning five continents, and over 4,691 kilometres of walking, running, or cycling pledged. Participants have been asked to pledge a minimum of 3 km for walking or running and a minimum of 10 km for cycling which can be done on one day of the Virtual Pink Walk/Run/Cycle event or spread out over all four days of the event if desired.  

 The theme for Breast Cancer Awareness Month this year is “Give Hope. Save Lives”. The underlying message of Breast Cancer Awareness Month which is being heavily promoted by the Indira Cancer Trust is Touch, Look, Check (TLC) which gives a clear, simple message to women encouraging them to check their breasts every month for anything out of the ordinary as well as to look up information about the signs and symptoms of breast cancer. The knowledge that breast cancer exists is not enough; it is vital that all women over the age of 20 do a monthly self-breast examination on a fixed date and look for anything out of the ordinary.  

 The Virtual Pink Walk/Run/Cycle is the Indira Cancer Trust’s way of not letting the pandemic get in the way of spreading the message about breast cancer this year. Indira Cancer Trust Fundraising Co-ordinator Dhakshinie Karunaratne shared that there was initially a month of physical activities planned to commemorate Breast Cancer Awareness Month. The rise of Covid-19 infections in Sri Lanka in early October has meant a reworking of these plans with public health and safety in mind.  

 “On Friday, 16 October, we held a webinar with the Lions Club of Colombo District 306 B2 on breast cancer awareness, featuring the story of a breast cancer survivor. We will be hosting another similar webinar with the Rotary Club on 25 October,” Karunaratne shared, adding: “Areas of Colombo were also lit up in pink to commemorate Breast Cancer Awareness Month, including the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) which was lit in pink for the first week of October. Initially, the CMC was supposed to be lit for the entire month, but this changed with the second wave of Covid-19.” 

 The main calendar of events for Breast Cancer Awareness Month, was to be held from 22 to 25 October, including a fashion show, high tea, a Pink Walk, and a cycling event (Pink Pedalling). While the activity aspect of this calendar has been instituted into the Virtual Pink/Walk/Run/Cycle event, other aspects of the event schedule are being currently adapted for maximum impact during this time of social distancing.  

 Karunaratne shared that the high tea planned as part of the original roster of events was also to be a fundraising exercise with Spa Ceylon partnering with the Indira Cancer Trust to gift each woman in attendance with a Spa Ceylon gift pack. “With the high tea no longer possible due to Covid-19 restrictions, we are now offering tickets to the high tea for sale as donations to the cause, with the first 100 donations receiving a gift pack from Spa Ceylon,”  Karunaratne noted.  

 “We are hoping to hold a panel discussion featuring Indira Cancer Trust Chairman Dr. Lanka Jayasuriya-Dissanayake, Dr. Janaki Vidanapathirana of the National Cancer Control Programme, Stephanie Siriwardhana, and Malini Fonseka, who is also a breast cancer survivor,” Karunaratne shared, adding: “The date and location of this panel discussion are still tentative; we hope to hold it at the Dutch Hospital Shopping Precinct in partnership with Spa Ceylon and make it a small, physical event which the general public can attend.”  

 In addition to building awareness about breast cancer, the Indira Cancer Trust also hopes to raise funds to help women fighting breast cancer. Established in November 2016, the Indira Cancer Trust offers an array of much-needed support services for people living with cancer, with a special emphasis on providing information on any type of cancer care. The Indira Cancer Trust also operates a highly useful cancer helpline that provides emotional support for women dealing with breast cancer, while providing several other very important services via the Indira Care Service and the Indira Paediatric Care Department and with the Apeksha Hospital Maharagama as well as the cancer wards of hospitals in Karapitiya and Nuwara Eliya.  

 All funds raised during Breast Cancer Awareness Month are being used to sponsor breast prostheses and wigs for women dealing with breast cancer. A breast prosthesis costs Rs. 500 to produce and a wig costs Rs. 12,500 to make and are provided free of charge to women in need by the Indira Cancer Trust.  

 It is the Indira Cancer Trust’s hope to build breast cancer awareness through the Virtual Pink Walk/Run/Cycle as well as the other events held during Breast Cancer Awareness Month encouraging every woman to remember TLC throughout the year to keep themselves safe and healthy.  

  The Virtual Pink Walk/Run/Cycle is to take place from 22 to 25 October. Participants may register at http://bit.ly/pinkTLC or the Virtual Pink Walk/Run/Cycle event page on Facebook.

,,UNP to stage protest against Sirisena,news," By Skandha Gunasekara  UNP stalwart and Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Harin Fernando, told  The Sunday Morning  that the UNP would be conducting a protest march this week, against political moves orchestrated by President Maithripala Sirisena over the weekend. “We will be conducting a massive protest march on Tuesday (30) against the unconstitutional acts carried out by President Sirisena,” Minister Fernando said.  He said that the UNP would be demanding the Parliament is convened immediately, in order to establish who has the majority numbers in the House.  “Until they can prove that they have a majority in Parliament, the Prime Minister cannot be changed,” he said. The Minister went on to say that until a decision is taken by Parliament, the Ministers of the coalition Government would retain the Ministerial portfolios.  “We blame the President for the political turmoil and the Constitutional crisis that is on-going.

,,Increasing cost of living : CoL committee decisions yet to be implemented,news," By Sarah Hannan 

 As the country's economy is making gradual steps towards recovery in the post-lockdown era, the increasing prices of consumer goods in the market and unfavourable weather seem to have increased the demand for daily commodities against the supplies. 

 The blanket import ban has caused a strain in the market, as prices of fast dwindling food stocks too seem to reach high prices, with suppliers not releasing hidden stocks awaiting the right time to sell them at higher market rates. 

 This has resulted in people turning to purchasing smuggled commodities that are transported through fishing boats and attempting to sell the stocks at a nominal price. The recent increase in turmeric smuggling rackets itself is an example of the socioeconomic impact the import ban is causing. 

 It was in August that the Cabinet Subcommittee on Cost of Living held their first meeting at the Presidential Secretariat, chaired by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa himself. During which he instructed the committee members that the Government is looking to take necessary measures to reduce cost of living by implementing decisions that were taken. 

President Rajapaksa was of the view that there should be a smooth transition from an import-based economy to a self-sufficient economy. 

 The biggest issue Sri Lanka is facing is that although the market is required to turn to local suppliers to fulfil the consumer demand, the vendors are unable to supply goods at an affordable rate to the consumer. 

 The President said that even though the public faced difficulties for a short period of time, measures that are taken to strengthen the rural economy and uplift the farming community cannot be reversed. 

 It was also discussed that similar to the mechanism that was in practice during the lockdown period, the Government should take steps to deliver farm produce directly to the consumers at a subsidised price. The President noted that continuing this practice would remove the middlemen and protect both the farmer and consumer. 

 Such procedures, President Rajapaksa believed, would address the issues faced by the middleclass in the suburbs due to inflation. 

 “Promoting the economic condition of the people in remote areas and reducing the cost of living burden of the people in the suburbs should be addressed simultaneously” President stressed. 

 In order to accomplish it and deliver farmer’s produce straight to the consumers, use of government business institutions such as Sathosa, co-ops, Govi Jana Seva Centres, and the security forces was discussed. 

 Revamping the islandwide network of economic centres and implementation of a proper system to purchase farmer’s produce was also taken into consideration by the cabinet subcommittee. 

 An entire month has lapsed and it is clear that no procedure is in place to ensure that consumers can get their commodities from farm to their doorstop or to the nearest government-owned retail institution as discussed. 

 This meant that the consumer for the past month had to hackle through erratic pricings that were floating in the market. 

 During the meeting, the impact of the rise in prices of several essential commodities on the economy of the urban middleclass was discussed. 

 “In order to earn a stable and strong income for the rural farmers who make up about 40% of the population, we need to develop confidence that they would get a high price for their produce and assure a stable market for them,” President said. 

 The President further added that without taking such measures they cannot encourage the rural communities to engage themselves in the agricultural sector while pointing out the difficulty of removing the existing import restrictions. 

 The most suited solution which was suggested during the meeting was to implement a digital platform for distribution purposes to make a considerable impact on this matter. Given that prices of vegetables are massively impacting a large issue on the cost of living today, the Government said that removing the middleman from the chain of supply can assist in bringing down the prices of commodities. 

 “We need everyone’s support for our efforts to reduce the cost of living of the people. The corporate sector must ensure that some percentage of the benefits of the tax concessions recently provided to them is passed onto the public as well. Accordingly, we expect a reduction in the price of all goods and services on which taxes have been reduced,” President Rajapaksa had noted in June. 

  The Sunday Morning    contacted the Prime Minister’s Office to inquire on the progress of implementing the recommendations. However, we were informed by the Prime Minister’s Media Secretary Rohan Weliwita that following the first meeting that was held on 31 August, the Cabinet Subcommittee on Cost of Living had not convened for further discussions; that is even after President Rajapaksa had requested the officials to update him once a week on the market status. 

 When asked as to when the committee would convene, given that Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was the head of the subcommittee, Weliwila stated: “Looking at the schedule for the next two weeks, there is no sign of the cabinet subcommittee convening. To our knowledge, the suggestions that were made during the first meeting were to be further deliberated and suitable solutions were to be proposed at the next meeting, which is yet to take place.” 

 Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, Minister of Trade Bandula Gunawardana, Minister of Plantation Ramesh Pathirana, Minister of Agriculture Mahindananda Aluthgamage, State Ministers Arundika Fernando, Shasheendra Rajapaksa, Lasantha Alagiyawanna, Secretary to the President Dr. P.B Jayasundara, and the secretaries to the respective ministries are members of the subcommittee.

,,Fate of CDS hangs in the balance?,news,"By Santhush Fernando Despite the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) pushing hard to arrest Chief of Defence Staff Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne, following recently uncovered evidence over his alleged links to Sri Lanka Navy operatives who abducted 11 youth, the fate of the investigations now hangs in the balance. This development was a direct result of impending changes within the Law and Order Ministry, following last Friday’s political twists,  The Sunday Morning  learnt.  The Sunday Morning  reported last week that both the Secretary and Minister of the Law and Order Ministry were to take tangible decisions over the issue of CDS, who was among those accused of assisting “Navy Sampath”. The CID informed court that it had sufficient evidence to arrest Admiral Wijegunaratne but would first submit details on the case to the line ministry. Earlier, Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne instructed the CID to arrest the suspects accused of being involved in assisting (Lt. Cmdr.) Chandana Hettiarachchi alias Navy Sampath to flee the country. On 10 October, CID informed the court that it managed to arrest a civilian suspect – Kiringoda Gamage Laksiri Amaratunga – on charges of aiding and abetting a crime, harbouring an offender, intentional omission in giving information, forgery and forgery of a public document, and fraudulent use of a forged document. Startling revelations had been made to point out that the suspect Navy Sampath, who was attached to the Trincomalee Eastern Command Naval Base, had resided in the officers’ quarters at the base, after fleeing lawful custody with the backing of certain officials of Sri Lanka Navy. The Police had brought to the notice of the court, that Admiral Wijeguneratne had provided facilities, security, and instructions to the suspect, in order avoid lawful arrest. In addition, under the auspices of the Admiral, a sum of Rs. 500,000 had been handed over to the suspect by one Rear Admiral Hettiarachi from an account maintained by the Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy, for the suspect to travel abroad,  The Sunday Morning  learnt. Police also informed court that Amaratunga was deliberately lying in his statements in order to screen Navy Sampath and had therefore directly aided and abetted the commission of offences by the latter. Concerned citizens inquire as to why CDS is still not arrested whereas Senior DIG of Jaffna Lalith Jayasinghe was arrested last year for helping main accused Mahalingam Shashikumar alias Swiss Kumar in connection with the 2015 rape and murder of schoolgirl Sivaloganathan Vidya.

,,20th Amendment Bill : Opposition seeks postponement of debate,news," Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella has requested the Speaker of Parliament to postpone the debate on the 20th Amendment to the Constitution scheduled to take place this week. 

 In a letter addressed to Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Kiriella has claimed that Covid-19-infected persons have been reported from nearly every district in the country and that negligence on the part of the Government has led to it becoming a pandemic. 

 He charged that on several occasions since 22 April, the Government had declared that the Covid-19 threat had ended, pointing out that this, however, had not happened. 

 Kiriella also alleged that the Government has been late in introducing laws and regulations to help control the virus by around 10 months, whereas other countries across the globe had presented these regulations by May. 

 The Chief Opposition Whip stated that albeit somewhat delayed, several regulations have been gazetted and if they are to be followed, gatherings cannot be held and social distancing must be maintained. 

 Therefore, he alleged that the seating of MPs in the chamber contradicts the very same regulations introduced by the Government, while the continuation of parliamentary sittings also violate the regulations at a time when gatherings have been limited. 

 Therefore, Kiriella, in his letter, has requested the Speaker to take necessary steps to postpone the debate on the 20th Amendment to the Constitution scheduled for this week. 

 He has also requested to provide an opportunity to discuss this matter by convening Parliament this week under the new regulations introduced by the Government.

,,Covid-19 economic impact : Women-led SMEs more likely to borrow informally than from banks,business," Women-owned small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Sri Lanka were least likely to have taken a loan from a financial institution and are far more likely to have borrowed from family and friends to meet financial obligations during Covid-19, according to a new report. 

 The report, titled “Gendered Impacts of Covid-19 on Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises”, was compiled by Women in Work, a partnership between IFC and the Australian Government. 

 Presenting a snapshot of the impacts of the pandemic, the report is based on surveys of SME clients of four financial institutions and from the distribution network of one fast-moving consumer goods company. It shows almost three quarters of SMEs surveyed experienced decreased sales. Nearly two-thirds of the SMEs saw their sales drop by more than 25% on their pre-Covid monthly average. 

 “Overall, our research shows little difference between the impacts on businesses – whether they were owned by men, women, or jointly owned,” said IFC Country Manager for Sri Lanka and the Maldives Amena Arif. “But it was clear that women were less likely to access loans from formal banks to support their businesses and more likely to take a more traditional route, borrowing from family and friends. They were also much less likely to use digital business channels. This highlights potential areas for future work with financial institutions to tailor their support to meet the unique needs of female and male business owners.” 

 In response, the IFC-DFAT report offers recommendations, including increased access to working capital solutions and other loans for women-owned SMEs (WSMEs), better access to business-related training, and greater support to help small businesses shift to digital business channels. 

 “We hope the report’s recommendations will be a useful input into creating a more resilient Sri Lankan economy in which women-owned businesses make a greater contribution,” said Australian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka David Holly. 

 Beyond its focus on women, the report showed that eight out of 10 SMEs in Sri Lanka experienced difficulties meeting operating expenses and had some shortfall in debt repayment or ability to meet financial obligations due to Covid-19. Moreover, over three quarters of SMEs reported difficulties accessing their usual financial services. Companies in the manufacturing and construction sectors are the hardest hit, followed by the services sector. However, despite the challenges, almost three-quarters of the SMEs surveyed predicted they would continue to operate indefinitely. 

 The findings are based on a survey completed by 413 SMEs from across the country between 22 June and 22 July 2020. Around one million SMEs – 25% of which are women-owned – account for about 45% of total employment in Sri Lanka. 

 IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, is the largest global development institution focused on the private sector in emerging markets and works in more than 100 countries.

,,Paddy purchasing mechanism : Small and medium-scale millers protected,news," State Minister of Samurdhi, Household Economy, Microfinance, Self-employment, Business Development, and Underutilised State Resources Development Shehan Semasinghe said that the Government will take all necessary measures to encourage small and medium-scale paddy mill owners. 

 The Minister said that there is a process in place to protect farmers, small and medium-scale mill owners, as well as consumers in the Government’s programme to purchase paddy. He was speaking at a meeting organised by small and medium-scale mill owners in the Anuradhapura District. 

 Anuradhapura Chief Government Agent Attorney-at-Law R.M. Wanninayake, who was present at the occasion, said that in the early days of the spread of the Covid-19 disease in the country, the Government’s programme to purchase paddy was carried out more actively than ever through the district secretariats. 

 During the 2019/20 Maha season, the Government launched a programme to convert paddy stocks purchased from the Anuradhapura District into rice using small and medium-scale mill owners and then supply them to the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment (CWE), with the aim of alleviating the situation when there was a countrywide shortage of rice. 

 Anuradhapura Additional District Secretary Ruwan Bandara Navaratne, an official who spearheaded the programme, stated that small and medium-scale mill owners in Anuradhapura have been instrumental in this endeavour.

,,Covid survives up to 9 hrs on human skin: Japanese study,news," The new coronavirus can survive on the surface of human skin for around nine hours, some five times the period influenza can, a team of researchers in Japan has found. 

 The researchers, including epidemiology specialist Ryohei Hirose, a research associate at Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, additionally found that if the new coronavirus is exposed to alcohol-based disinfectant or ethanol of the same concentration, the virus is deactivated within 15 seconds. 

 As a result, Hirose is calling for people to thoroughly wash their hands or use alcohol-based disinfectant. 

 The group’s findings were published in the online edition of US-based science journal “Clinical Infectious Diseases” on 3 October. 

 According to the group, when the new coronavirus and influenza A were applied to the surface of skin, the new coronavirus lasted for around nine hours on it, while the flu strain remained for about 1.8 hours. Both the coronavirus and the flu remained active over the periods. To ensure that test subjects were not infected by the virus, researchers used skin samples from a person whose body was donated for a medical autopsy. 

 The team also applied the viruses to surfaces more conducive to their survival, such as on stainless steel, heat-resistant glass, and plastic. It was found that the new coronavirus stayed active on them for between around 58 and 85 hours, whereas influenza lasted between about six and 11 hours. In all instances, the new coronavirus survived far longer. 

 Furthermore, the team also investigated the efficacy of ethanol when used as an alcohol-based disinfectant. They used ethanol at an 80% concentration, the same as in alcohol-based disinfectants available for sale, and found that it completely neutralised both the new coronavirus and influenza virus within 15 seconds, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness as a disinfectant. 

 “It appears that the relatively long time in which the new coronavirus can survive on human skin is among the background factors making it difficult to confirm infection routes. If it’s staying active for nine hours, then it’s difficult to prevent infections from touch. There’s only so much that individual efforts can accomplish, so it’s important not to blame people who do become infected,” Hirose said. 

 The researchers, including epidemiology specialist Ryohei Hirose, a research associate at Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, additionally found that if the new coronavirus is exposed to alcohol-based disinfectant or ethanol of the same concentration, the virus is deactivated within 15 seconds.

,,Rishad remanded : 7 suspects arrested for aiding Rishad,news," MP Rishad Bathiudeen was arrested last morning (19) by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and was remanded until 27 October after being produced before the Fort Magistrate’s Court. 

 He was arrested at a housing complex located in Ebenezer Place, Dehiwala. 

 Furthermore, seven suspects were also arrested for aiding Bathiudeen to evade arrest, Police Media Spokesman Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Ajith Rohana said. 

 Accordingly, the suspects, arrested by the CID, were to be produced before the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court last evening. 

 He further said that during the arrest of Bathiudeen, it was revealed that there was a group of people who provide protection to persons wanted by the Police. 

 The DIG said that two among the seven arrestees had been arrested on 17 October in the Wellampitiya area. Upon interrogation, it had been revealed that the MP had stayed at a house in the Kohuwala/Kalubowila area for some time before moving to a house in Dehiwala on 15 October. 

 Among the arrestees are a lady doctor and her husband, a foreign employment agent who escorted the MP from the first house to the second, and the owner of the Dehiwala house where the MP was arrested. 

 The vehicle used to escort Bathiudeen has also been taken into the custody of the CID, according to the Police Media Spokesman. 

 Former Minister of Industry and Commerce Bathiudeen, internally displaced persons (IDP) resettling Project Director Mohamed Yaseen Samsudeen, and Project Accountant Alagarathnam Manoranjan were accused of violating Article 82(1) of the Presidential Elections Act No. 15 of 1981 by misappropriating public funds amounting to Rs. 9.5 million. They have allegedly misused 222 buses belonging to the state-owned Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) to transport IDPs from Puttalam to the Silavathurai Polling Division in Mannar during the 2019 presidential election. 

 The CID, upon the direction of the Attorney General (AG), had sought the Colombo Fort Magistrate to issue a warrant to arrest Bathiudeen and the other two suspects on charges of criminal misappropriation of public funds and violation of election laws. However, the Magistrate ruled that the Police can proceed to arrest the suspects without a warrant, after which AG Dappula de Livera directed the Police to arrest the three suspects. Moreover, the Fort Magistrate has also imposed a travel ban on Bathiudeen on the request of the CID. 

 MP Bathiudeen has currently been escorted to the CID and will be produced before a court following investigations, DIG Rohana said. 

 Moreover, the AG has advised the CID on their failure to place Bathiudeen under surveillance 24 hours before issuing a directive for the arrest. In the meantime, the CID is carrying out further investigations.

,,CID directed to keep Rishad under surveillance,news," Attorney General (AG) Dappula de Livera has advised the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on the prudence to place MP Rishad Bathiudeen under surveillance 24 hours before issuing the directive for his arrest. 

 Co-ordinating Officer to the AG State Counsel Nishara Jayaratne said the arrest of Bathiudeen is not something that had happened suddenly. 

 She stated that 24 hours before the AG’s advice pertaining to the arrest was provided in writing to the CID officers and the Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP), the AG had summoned the CID officers and verbally instructed them on pre-preparation before making the arrest. 

 Accordingly, the AG had advised the high-raking CID officers to carry out suitable surveillance on Bathiudeen and stay alert 24 hours before the advice was handed over in writing, State Counsel Jayaratne said. 

 She stated that if the CID officers had followed the AG’s verbal advice regarding surveillance, the suspect would not have been able to flee. 

 Meanwhile, the AG yesterday (19) had provided the Acting IGP with further advice in writing with regard to the criminal investigation against Bathiudeen and had also met with the investigative officers of the CID. 

 It had been revealed during that discussion that the CID is also carrying out investigations regarding over 10 more incidents related to Bathiudeen. 

 The AG had presented the Acting IGP with detailed information pertaining to those investigations and issued instructions to conduct further investigations under the offence of money laundering, and instructed to appoint a special team of experienced and knowledgeable officers to carry out the investigations efficiently and thoroughly. 

 Furthermore, the AG had instructed to carry out criminal investigations against all individuals who had abetted MP Bathiudeen to evade arrest and remain in hiding, and to report to the court. The AG had then instructed to especially investigate into the individuals who held press conferences and made statements that the former Minister was in hiding, she said. 

 The AG has called for reports on progress of investigations within the next two weeks, it is learnt.

           Ja-Ela Divisional Secretariat to survey land  
 
 By Sarah Hannan 

 Minister of Environment Mahinda Amaraweera has instructed the Ja-Ela Divisional Secretariat to immediately survey the land area in the Muthurajawela marshland, so that the Ministry of Environment could gazette it as a “protected wetland sanctuary”. 

 Amaraweera had arrived at this decision following his visit to the marshland after environmentalists had alerted him over the alleged illegal land acquisition that was taking place and the daily pollution caused by waste matter, wastewater, and other industrial solid waste being dumped into the marshland. 

 “The Muthurajawela marshland is a sensitive ecosystem that is of extreme importance to Sri Lanka’s biodiversity and especially important to the Western Province’s ecosystem. I wanted to see for myself whether the reports were true, which is why I visited the area on Sunday,” Amaraweera told    The Morning   . 

 For months, environmental activist groups have been sharing documented evidence of the continued destruction that had been taking place at the marshland. It was revealed that a businessman had earmarked a land extent of 126,000 perches within the Muthurajawela marshland by setting up signage which read “private property – do not enter”. 

 Amaraweera said that during his visit, he observed the amount of waste that has been dumped and the wastewater that was being released from the nearby pig farms. Moreover, the Minister had also observed how industrial waste too was being dumped at the site. 

 “I have instructed the Ja-Ela Divisional Secretariat to consider this as an emergency situation and launch a survey over the Muthurajawela marshland to differentiate the area that belong to the (Central) Environmental Authority and the parts that are privately owned,” Amarawera elaborated. 

 Once the survey is done, the Muthurajawela marshland will be recognised as a protected wetland sanctuary by the Ministry of Environment through a gazette notification. 

 The Minister also noted that following the survey, the Ministry will take necessary legal action against those who have encroached into the wetland, regardless of their social status.

,,Covid-19 : Declare if there is social transmission - GMOA,news," 
           Epidemiology Unit urged to conduct GPS mapping of spread  
 
 By Maheesha Mudugamuwa 

 The Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health has been urged to carry out GPS mapping of the spread of Covid-19-positive cases among society and declare whether or not there is social transmission. 
 When contacted by    The Morning   , Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Senal Fernando stressed that it as the chief epidemiologists who should declare whether there is social transmission of the virus within the country, as it is the Epidemiology Unit that receives all data from around the country, especially regarding the whereabouts of the infected persons and their contacts. 

 “The definition of social transmission is that there should be more than one Covid-19 cluster within society for those whose origin cannot be traced. To get a good idea about the spread of the virus, GPS mapping should be done and made available to the public,” he said yesterday (19). 

 Meanwhile, government statistics yesterday revealed that a total of 47 individuals have tested positive for Covid-19, increasing the number of patients in the Minuwangoda cluster to 2,122, of which four have been reported from quarantine centres while the others were reported as their close associates. 

 The National Operation Centre for Prevention of Covid-19 Outbreak (NOCPCO) yesterday announced that three Covid-19-infected patients from the Minuwangoda Brandix cluster have recovered and were discharged from hospitals for the first time. 

 Accordingly, the total number of patients recovered from the virus rose to 3,440 while the toll of confirmed Covid-19 patients detected so far stood at 5,585. 

 Meanwhile, the authorities have conducted 391,060 PCR tests so far.

,,Dengue claims more lives than Covid 19,news," By Sarah Hannan 

 The national dengue eradication programme and public awareness campaign was launched last Sunday (18) under the patronage of Minister of Health Pavithra Wanniarachchi, focusing on the Kuruwita Medical Officer of Health Division in the Ratnapura District. 

Minister of Health Pavithra Wanniarachchi distributes leaflets to improve awareness on dengue control in Kuruwita, 18 October 2020.

 Speaking at the event, Wanniarachchi said the Government will launch an operation to control Covid-19 as well as to eradicate dengue mosquitoes, both of which are having a devastating impact on society. 

 She pointed out that more lives have been lost in Sri Lanka due to dengue than due to Covid-19. While only 13 deaths were reported due to Covid-19, 34 lives were lost due to dengue this year. The Minister emphasised that people should also support the Government's programme to control dengue mosquitoes by cleaning their premises. 

 A total of 4,311 dengue patients were reported from the whole island in the second quarter of 2020, with the highest number of dengue patients being reported from the Kandy and Ratnapura Districts, reporting 715 and 668 cases, respectively. 

 The highest number of dengue patients reported from a Medical Officer of Health Division in the Ratnapura District was from Kuruwita, amounting to 169 patients. Owing to this, the national dengue mosquito control programme was launched from Kuruwita. 

 According to Epidemiology Unit records, a total of 27,870 dengue patients have been reported in the last few months this year, and due to the prevailing rainy weather, there is a risk of the spread of dengue. 

 “This is National Mosquito Control Week. We have to pay equal attention in eradicating dengue and controlling the spread of Covid-19 at this time. This year we have recorded the lowest number of dengue patients in the last 10 years. In 2018, about 51,000 dengue patients were reported. In 2019, 105,049 dengue patients were reported, with 158 deaths. This year, only 34 deaths due to dengue have been reported,” Wanniarachchi explained. 

 She also noted that as a government, they are taking steps to recruit those in the Dengue Task Force to the public service. A cabinet paper is to be presented by the Minister of Health in this regard to extend their service in recognition of their commitment and interest in implementing the activities. 

 “I will submit to the Cabinet the additional allowances and overtime allowances required for the health workers working in the provincial councils, and the central government will take immediate action to provide funds to the provincial councils,” Wanniarachchi elaborated. 

 Health teams including the Minister of Health distributed leaflets to improve awareness on dengue control to the people of Kuruwita. 

 Sabaragamuwa Provincial Health Services Director Dr. Kapila Kannangara, National Dengue Control Unit Director Dr. Anura Jayasekera, Regional Epidemiologist Dr. Lakmal Konara, Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council Principal Secretary Ranjani Jayakody, Rathnapura Administrative Public Health Inspector Srilal Liyanage, and health officers including members from the tri-forces and the Police were present at the occasion.

,,20th Amendment Bill | Govt. decides on three amendments,news," 
 	  Parliament dissolution by President in two-and-a-half years  
 	  19A status quo to remain on auditing state entities  
 	  Emergency bills only if disaster or threat to national security  
 
 By Our Political Editor 

 The Government yesterday (19) evening decided to introduce three amendments to the proposed 20th Amendment Bill,  The Morning  learnt. 

 The announcement was made by Minister of Justice Ali Sabry last evening during the governing party parliamentary group meeting, a senior government minister told  The Morning . 

 It is learnt that the three amendments to the proposed new piece of legislation relate to the powers vested with the President to dissolve Parliament, auditing of state institutions, and the presentation of emergency bills. 

 The Government has decided to increase the number of years Parliament has to function before the President could dissolve the legislature to two-and-a-half years. 

 Also, the auditing of state institutions is to be carried out in the same manner as previously stipulated in the 19th Amendment. 

 The other amendment is to limit the submission of emergency bills to times of disasters and in the event of a threat to national security. 

 However, no decision had been reached to amend the clause on dual citizens holding public office under the 20th Amendment, which has gathered much opposition by several coalition partners of the Government. 

 Meanwhile, Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena is to announce to Parliament today (20) the observations of the Supreme Court on the petitions that were filed against the proposed 20th Amendment Bill. 

 Once the Supreme Court observations are announced, the governing party might also look at introducing other amendments to the Bill at the committee stage of the debate in Parliament. 

 The debate on the 20th Amendment Bill is scheduled to take place tomorrow (21) and on Thursday (22). ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,20th Amendment Bill | Govt. decides on three amendments,news,0,1603158620,0,101789,,

,,Namal’s evidence inadmissible: Attorney tells court,news,"By Santhush Fernando Major breaches in Namal Kumara’s recorded evidence and the dubious credibility of the witness render the evidence inadmissible, the lawyer appearing for ex-TID DIG Nalaka de Silva – Ajith Pathirana – told  The Sunday Morning .        “I have taken two strong defences against the admissibility of voice recordings provided by Namal Kumara. In order to admit the voice recordings contained in Namal Kumara’s mobile phone as expert evidence to court, under Evidence (Special Provisions) Act (No. 14 of 1995) which relates to admissibility of audio or visual recordings, five conditions have to be fulfilled. “However, Namal’s recordings have breached two important conditions which render such evidence inadmissible. One condition is that such evidence cannot be tampered with, and the other is that the original device must be presented; both these have been breached. “In addition, the CID and the Government Analyst’s Department have informed court that they do not have technology to recover these erased recordings, which relate to assassination allegations. As a result, such evidence cannot be admissible in a case which limits the personal liberties of an individual,” Pathirana said.      “In addition, there are many factors that rebut the credibility of both the witness and his evidence. The fact that he is said to be an army deserter relates to the rebuttal of his credibility and as he has failed to explicitly say as to when such recordings (concerning assassinations) were made and, deliberately or otherwise, failed to come forward three to four months after receiving such calls, hampers the credibility of the (non-existent) recordings,” he added. When the case (B 10744/18) was taken up before the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court on 16 October, the Homicide Investigations Department of the Police Criminal Investigations Department (CID) informed court that by plotting anti-government conspiracies and instigating assassination of VIPs whilst being the head of a vital investigative Police arm, such as the Terrorism Investigations Department (TID), Deputy Inspector of Police Nalaka de Silva could have caused major damage not only to the Sri Lanka Police and the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, but also the Sri Lankan public at large,  The Sunday Morning  learnt. In addition, submitting its voice analysis report, Assistant Examiner of Questioned Documents (EQD) of the Government Analyst’s Department – S. A. Batakandage – affirmed to court that the voice analysis ascertained had confirmed that the voices in the audio marked P1 to P123, recorded with mobile phone of Huawei KII-L21 model belonging to Attanayaka Mudiyanselage Namal Kumara, matched the voice samples of suspect DIG Waduge Kaushal Nalaka de Silva and the Director of Counter Corruption Force – the said Namal Kumara. Early this month,  The Sunday Morning  reported that Police investigations into the allegations of a possible plot to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena had unearthed evidence of attempts by the beleaguered anti-terror DIG Nalaka de Silva to perpetrate and spearhead subversive activities including assassinating and causing disrepute to high-ranking Police officials and mobilising radicals to organise into disruptive groups – thereby pushing the country in to a chaotic situation – possibly in a bid to gain political mileage at forthcoming elections. A top secret dossier handed over to President Sirisena set out elaborate details of the plot with the CID ascertaining that de Silva had requested police informant Namal Kumara not only to plan attempts on the life of President Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa in the Eastern Province but also assassinate another high ranking Police official in Colombo.  In addition, according to a telecon, purportedly recorded by Nalaka Kumara, the beleaguered DIG had asked the informant to publish fake news reports on the internet, causing disrepute and inconvenience to National Police Commission member Saman Dissanayake, Police Special Task Force Commandant Senior DIG M. R. Latheef, Senior DIG Nandana Munasinghe, State Intelligence Service (SIS) Director DIG Nilantha Jayawardena, and other high-ranking police officials.

,,TNA puts forward conditions for support,news,"By Easwaran Rutnam The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) put forward two key conditions in order for either Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa or United National Party (UNP) Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe to garner their support in Parliament.

,,International Education Services hosts The EdTour – Virtual Edition,brunch," The one thing that the pandemic has not stopped dead in its tracks is the education industry. From schools and universities switching to online teaching and learning, to the Government powering through and holding scholarship exams and Advanced Levels (A/L) in the midst of a second wave of Covid-19, education has kept putting one foot in front of the other and marching on.  


 With A/Ls concluded-ish and the end of the year approaching, many are now turning their thoughts to higher education and what comes after school; with the whole world more or less on lockdown, finding the perfect university in which to study is something of a challenge. Enter The EdTour – Virtual Edition.  

 The EdTour – Virtual Edition is a virtual university fair organised by educational consulting agency International Education Services (IES) in partnership with EdPrograms, Pakistan, to help prospective students and their parents figure out which university is the best fit for them and their life goals.  

 The EdTour – Virtual Edition features a great lineup of universities from all over the world including the US, Canada, Singapore, Qatar, Turkey, and Pakistan.  

 Adapting to an online environment, The EdTour – Virtual Edition aims to incorporate technology to create an interactive and meaningful experience for students, parents, and participating institutions. The EdTour – Virtual Edition takes shape in the form of scheduled events based on the major a prospective student is interested in. There will be specialised sessions for both undergraduate and graduate students.  

 Each participating institution will have its own virtual booth that will allow students to consult with them in small groups throughout the event. This virtual booth will include an exhibitor profile and live room (similar to a Zoom room) on The EdTour platform. Prospective students and parents can enter any room they like to meet the universities. 

 Students will be able to meet with international admissions directors from specific institutions who will be showcasing their STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), business, liberal arts, humanities, and speciality degree programs (film, architecture, arts, and design). In addition to course-specific information, students will also get the chance to learn about scholarships, assistantships, admissions criteria, and the international student experience at various campuses. 

 Students who haven’t yet decided what they want their majors to be are welcome to attend all sessions and make a fully informed decision about the direction they want their life to take.  

 The EdTour – Virtual Edition will include three undergraduate events and one graduate event for prospective Sri Lankan students to consult with a host of universities including University of Massachusetts – Amherst, Fordham University, The University of Texas at Arlington, New York Film Academy, and Northwestern University in the US; York University, University of Calgary, and Ryerson University in Canada; and Yale-NUS College in Singapore. 

IES Director Edna Christine Selvanayagam

Therefore, it’s important that they register early to take advantage of this unique opportunity.

,,Polio Talk show by Rotaract District 3220 Sri Lanka and Maldives,brunch," Rotaract District 3220 Sri Lanka and Maldives, together with Interact District 3220 and Rotary District 3220, were to carry out the polio parade on 24 October from 3.30 p.m. onwards at CR&amp;FC Grounds, followed by the “Oba Nisa” BNS concert with a number of other artists at 6.30 p.m. However, due to the prevalent situation in the country, these events were cancelled.
 

 Speaking with Rotary International District 3220 Sri Lanka and Maldives District Rotaract Representative Rtn. Rtr. Kavindra Kasun Sigera, he shared that despite the events being put on hold, their efforts with regard to creating awareness about polio will continue. 

 Accordingly, they hope to carry on the fundraising element of the initiative, where they make an annual donation to the global foundation for eradication of polio. He said the number of polio cases has fallen by over 99% since the launch of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 1988. Sri Lanka has been polio-free since 1993, while the WHO Southeast Asian region was certified polio-free in 2014. However, regardless, there remain those who still suffer from it, Kasun said, adding that therefore awareness is necessary. 

 He also stated that while their plans were thwarted with regard to the concert and the parade, they hope to instead host a talk show where they can create awareness with regard to their cause. He said that half of the population is unaware of the nature of polio and are not at all familiar with the illness, and while we are fortunate enough to have immunised effectively, it is important to still remain aware. 

 Kasun shared further about the talk show that they hope to host as a digital forum, where they hope to feature persons involved in having pioneered the movement to eradicate polio around the world. He shared a moment in Sri Lanka’s history where there was a two-day cease-fire between the warring factions in our civil war in order to immunise children, also sharing that this was the extent the initiative went in order to rid Sri Lanka of polio. 

 In addition to the Rotaract District’s efforts with polio, Kasun shared with us a number of other initiatives that fall under their purview, including their efforts in creating awareness about the Covid-19 pandemic with their “Stop the Spread” campaign launched in July. He said that this particular movement is innovative in that they do not only focus on creating awareness, but also work with the Sri Lanka Standards Institute (SLSI) in awarding certification for Covid-19-controlled environments, under which a number of companies have already been certified. 

 He also shared that under the “Stop the Spread” campaign during the election times, they ran a campaign called “Viral Vote” where they created extensive awareness with regard to the procedure that needs to be allowed during the election time, especially when one heads towards the polling station. He said that they chose to provide this assistance because the elections were the very first major event we had to face following the height of the pandemic, and they wished to give a hand in making sure everything went smoothly. 

 Finally, Kasun shared an upcoming initiative the Rotaract District is involved in – a mobile application that is currently under development, which they have worked on together with the Ministry of Health. The app will serve the purpose of assisting public health inspectors (PHIs) keep track of those who are ordered to stay under quarantine, as PHIs often must make visits twice a day to those who are supposed to be under quarantine. The app allows them to monitor if the persons under quarantine are remaining within their allowed radius, Kasun said, adding that the app is ready to be tested and will be tested around the area of the National Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH).

,,Covid-19 and PCR testing : Govt. urged to look at new testing methods,news,"Look at serum, antigen, and antibody tests: MLTs  
Looking at introducing antigen tests: Health Ministry  
 
 By Maheesha Mudugamuwa 

 Concerns have been raised by Medical Laboratory Technologists (MLTs) over the issues relating to PCR tests and the delay in introducing new testing mechanisms that suit bulk testing. 

They claimed the current PCR test was a traditional and time-consuming testing mechanism and therefore, urged the Health Ministry to introduce serum, antigen, and antibody tests to conduct bulk or random testing and to avoid the spread of the virus within the society.   

 However, when contacted by    The Morning   , Health Ministry Spokesman Dr. Jayaruwan Bandara said the possibility of introducing an antigen test for Covid-19 in Sri Lanka was currently being looked at and discussions were ongoing. 

 Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Association of Government Medical Laboratory Technologists (SLGMLT) has raised concerns over the issues relating to PCR tests which recorded negative results following a false positive test result. 

 SLGMLT President Ravi Kumudesh yesterday (20) said the Association had already written to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Health Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi to reveal to the public the laboratories which carried out those tests and the responsible officer who took the decision to hand over testing to the private sector. 

 “It is impossible to get a negative test result following a positive result unless there is a 99% laboratory issue and a person can get a negative result after a positive result only when that person is naturally cured from the virus after around 14 days,” he stressed. 

 Alleging that almost all these false test results have been issued from the private sector, Kumudesh stressed that the government laboratories have the capacity to conduct 10,000 PCR tests per day. 

 “There is no need to hand over testing facilities to the private sector,” he noted, claiming that the test system could be improved so as to give results within a short period of time. 

 According to him, the current testing system was traditional and should instead be improved. He added that serum, antigen, and antibody tests should be conducted within the country to identify the sources and the extent of the spread of the virus within the society. 

 “A PCR test can identify if the virus is within the body and if a person got infected from the virus but got cured naturally, then that person cannot be identified through a PCR test. To conduct bulk screening, antibody or serum tests should be conducted,” he explained.

 In addition, the Speaker in consultation with the Leader of the Opposition is to nominate five persons from the Opposition MPs to be members of the Council.

,,‘Makandure Madush’ shot dead : Magistrate orders body be handed over to family,news,"Magistrate orders body be handed over to family  
 
Notorious underworld figure and drug kingpin “Makandure Madush” was shot dead in crossfire between the Police and other suspected underworld figures at the Maligawatte Housing Complex. The Colombo Additional Magistrate yesterday (20) ordered the Judicial Medical Officer to handover the body of Madush to his legal wife after the post mortem. 

 The Magistrate’s inquest of the notorious underworld figure and drug kingpin went underway yesterday (20) following his death at the Maligawatte Housing Complex.  

 The Magistrate of the No. 4 Magistrate’s Court in Hulftsdorp, Colombo inspected the scene and the body, according to Police Media Spokesman DIG Ajith Rohana. 

 The deceased’s wife had identified the body before the Magistrate and the body was to be handed over to relatives after the post mortem, he added. 

After uncovering information regarding a stock of 22 kg of heroin hidden at the Maligawatte Housing Complex, officers of the Colombo Crime Division (CCD) visited that location along with Makandure Madush. 

However, suspected underworld figures and drug traffickers had then reportedly opened fire at them. 

 Madush and two officers of the CCD were shot in the crossfire that ensued. 

 Madush had later succumbed to injuries. 

 The Police recovered 22 kg of heroin, two pistols, and a motorcycle during investigations at the Maligawatte Housing Complex where Madush was shot dead. 

 Meanwhile, two police constables attached to the CCD were also injured in the shootout. 

 “The two police constables injured in the incident are currently receiving treatment at the Colombo National Hospital,” said Rohana.  

 “A team including the Maligawatte Officer-In-Charge (OIC) is conducting investigations into the death. The evidence of the police officers who participated in this operation is to be presented before the courts.  

 “Furthermore, the CCD is conducting further investigations into the operation, and also after obtaining information regarding a motorcycle that was found at the scene,” he said. 

 The notorious underworld figure was in the custody of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) for nearly one-and-a-half years before he was transferred to the custody of the CCD on Friday (16). 

 Based on the information divulged by the drug kingpin during interrogations, a consignment of heroin weighing nearly 10 kg had been seized from the Kotikawatta area by the CCD on Saturday (17). 

 Samarasinghe Arachchige Madush Lakshitha alias Makandure Madush was an underworld gang leader in Sri Lanka who had been abroad in hiding several years before his arrest.  

 Madush was previously under the custody of the Dubai authorities after being arrested at a party thrown by him at a Dubai hotel back in October 2018. 

 Along with him, 31 Sri Lankans including underworld figures and celebrities were also arrested in Dubai. 

 Madush was deported from Dubai on 5 May 2019 and was taken into the custody of the CID upon arrival at the Bandaranaike international Airport, Katunayake (BIA). 

 He had allegedly operated his drug network, extortion rackets, and other criminal activities through his accomplices in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lanka Police was on the hunt for Madush, who was one of Sri Lanka’s most wanted criminals, for the past couple of years as he had managed to evade arrest by the Sri Lankan and foreign authorities on numerous occasions.

,,Rishad's writ fixed for November,news," The writ application filed by MP Rishad Bathiudeen, who was wanted over the misappropriation of millions in public funds during last year’s presidential election, was fixed for support on 6 November. 

 The petition, requesting the Appeal’s Court to prevent the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) from arresting the parliamentarian, was taken up before Justices Kumudini Wickramasinghe and Sobhitha Rajakaruna yesterday (20). 

 MP Bathiudeen was arrested at a housing complex located at Ebenezer Place in Dehiwala in the early hours of Monday (19). 

 He was later produced before the Fort Magistrate’s Court and remanded until 27 October. 

 Former Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen, Project Director Mohamed Yaseen Samsudeen, and Project Accountant Alagarathnam Manoranjan are accused of violating Article 82(1) of the Presidential Elections Act No. 15 of 1981 by misappropriating public funds to the tune of Rs. 9.5 million. 

 They allegedly misused 222 buses belonging to the state-owned Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) for transporting IDPs (internally displaced persons) from Puttalam to polling stations in Silavathurai, Mannar during the 2019 presidential election. 

 Last week, the CID, upon the direction of the Attorney General (AG), had sought an arrest warrant from the Colombo Fort Magistrate to arrest MP Bathiudeen and the other two suspects on charges of criminal misappropriation of public funds and violation of election laws. 

 However, the Magistrate ruled that the Police can proceed to arrest the suspects without a warrant. Thereby, AG Dappula de Livera directed the Police to arrest the three suspects according to the law. 

 On 14 October, the Fort Magistrate issued a travel ban on the parliamentarian upon request by the CID. 

 The CID later deployed several teams to arrest the former Minister, however, they were unable to locate and apprehend him until Monday.

,,Online uni exams : UGC to consider technical aspects,news," By Sarah Hannan 

 The University Grants Commission (UGC) is to look into the technical aspects of holding university examinations online for the upcoming academic year in order to avoid further delays in holding examinations. 

 UGC Chairman Prof. Sampath Amaratunga, speaking to    The Morning   , said that he has concerns over the idea of holding examinations online. 

 “Those who descend into protests at the Lipton Circus over the various injustices that the undergraduates have to face have not once suggested facilitating distance learning or holding examinations by way of online tools. With the present situation, we do not want to postpone the examinations that are to be held for universities and are looking at converting it to the online platform,” Prof. Amaratunga explained. 

 However, he also shared his concerns over how the majority of undergraduates would manage to face the examinations, should the switch from traditional paper-based examination methods to computer-based assessments take place. 

 Prof. Amaratunga also noted that the structuring of the questions that would be asked at the examination will need to change. In terms of the required answers from the students, the questions would need to be structured in a more analytical manner, instead of allowing for copy-pasting type of answers. 

 “Given that the students will be allowed to sit for the examinations remotely, we will have to allow them to follow the open-book method of examinations. That means the questions that we formulate will have to be more critical and analytical, rather than those being straightforward type explanations,” Prof. Amaratunga elaborated. 

 The next concern he had was whether all undergraduates would have access to a functioning personal computer or a laptop and whether they would face any technical difficulties whilst answering their examinations online. 

 He said that some undergraduates will be typing the answers through their smartphones, while some would have to travel to another place to access a computer at a friend’s/relative's house, also noting that for those who have no access to any such technologies, the university will have to facilitate them to sit for a written examination. 

 “That means, we will still have to print examination papers and set up examination halls to accommodate such students. It is not an easy task and therefore needs a lot more preparation and planning before we take a definitive decision on holding examinations online,” Prof. Amaratunga concluded. 

 He also noted that the dates to complete the examinations will have to be fixed in a flexible time schedule as well, given the challenges the undergraduates will have to overcome.

Questions have been raised over the lack of co-ordination established between law enforcement authorities and health officials while engaging in Covid-19 activities, health unions alleged.
They claimed that at times there were incidents where law enforcement authorities have acted contrary to the recommendations given by health officials.

All Ceylon Nurses’ Union (ACNU) President S.B. Mediwatta stressed that health officials, including nurses and doctors and their families who have been exposed to suspected Covid-19 patients, are currently facing difficulties as they are sent to quarantine centres instead of subjecting them to
home quarantine.

In some occasions, the officials and their family members face a huge risk as they are mixed with those suspected to have contracted the virus and those who have not been subjected to PCR tests.

Therefore, the Union urged the Government to conduct PCR tests immediately on those who are suspected to have contracted Covid-19 and to let those who tested negative for the virus complete a compulsory 14-day quarantine, instead of putting them in uncomfortable situations.",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Covid-19 : TUs note lack of co-ordination,news,0,1603233029,0,101886,,
,,New wave adds to finance and leasing companies’ stress: Fitch,business," The risk of a second coronavirus wave, together with weak borrower sentiment in an already fragile operating environment, would put further stress on Sri Lankan finance and leasing companies’ (FLCs) credit profiles, adding to existing pressures on asset quality and profitability, Fitch Ratings said yesterday (20).  

While these risks will test FLCs’ loss-absorbing capacity, Fitch Ratings said it believes the capital and profit buffers of most Fitch-rated standalone-driven FLCs (except for Bimputh Finance PLC, which will experience material capital erosion due to losses) will be adequate to cushion against moderate asset-quality shocks.   
  Fitch expects Sri Lanka’s real GDP to contract by 3.7% in 2020 due to the pandemic. The economic fallout has pressured the FLC sector’s asset quality with the six-months past due nonperforming loans (NPLs) ratio spiking to 14.1% by end-June 2020 (1QFY21) (FYE20: 11.4%). The sector’s return on assets turned negative to -2.3% in 1QFY21 (FYE20: 1.9%) due to high credit costs.   
  A prolonged restriction on vehicle importation and the resultant surge in second-hand vehicle prices are likely to hamper Sri Lankan FLCs’ medium-term growth prospects, Fitch said. The sector’s loans contracted by 0.2% Year-on-Year (YoY) in 1QFY21 (CAGR [compound annual growth rate] of 12% FY15–FY20), and leasing and hire purchases accounted for 55% of the sector’s lending (FYE15: 60%).   
  “We expect underlying asset-quality pressure, that has been building up due to the pandemic, to manifest from 3QFY21 and extend to FY22, as regulatory relief in the form of loan-repayment moratoriums has temporarily halted the recognition of credit impairments for much of this year. We believe that most of the FLCs' borrowers will not emerge unscathed from the economic downturn because they are largely sub-prime,” Fitch added.   
  It said weak earnings due to rising credit costs and slow loan growth will weigh on FLCs’ internal capital generation and noted this risk is more acute for small FLCs which already have weak profitability buffers, with credit costs consuming more than 70% of their pre-impairment operating profits.   
  A deadline extension to meet capital requirements and lower loan growth will ease near-term capital pressures for some companies, Fitch said. Out of 38 licenced finance companies in the sector, nine were non-compliant with minimum capital requirements at end-September 2020 and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has granted an extension to rectify the non-compliance.   
  Fitch believes THE banks’ diminished appetite to lend to the FLC sector could hurt small-to-mid-sized FLCs in particular, hampering their financial flexibility.   
  “Small entities tend to rely more on bank funding, while large FLCs’ better domestic franchises will underpin their liquidity profiles,” it said. ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,New wave adds to finance and leasing companies’ stress: Fitch,business,0,1603233038,0,101888,,
,,Jawatte Mosque and burial grounds under scrutiny,news,"Burying your dead should never be a burden, especially for people of the Islamic faith. The funeral rites followed by Muslims depict simplicity, with all who pass being washed and shrouded, funeral prayers conducted, and then buried.

 The Sunday Morning  through reliable sources learnt, that the Jawatte Muslim Burial Grounds, after appointing a consensually-selected management board, was charging varying burial fees from different localities.

Contradicting the teachings of Islam, the management is charging Rs. 25,000 upwards from Maldivians and Rs. 5,000-8,000 from the Slave Island locality, when they want to bury their dead at Jawatte.
The former trustees of the Jawatte Jumma Mosque and Burial Grounds have brought these matters to the attention of the Wakf Board and have filed a case at the tribunal, requesting a fair election and the abolishment of the present committee running the affairs of the mosque and burial ground.

The present management board members do not possess any documents or letters of appointment of trusteeship issued by the Wakf Board (thereby surpassing a mandatory regulation).

The Wakf Board and tribunal’s inaction to hear this case opposes the true spirit of Islam. The case has been dragged for more than two years, thereby enabling and indirectly supporting an illegal coterie to run the affairs of this mosque and burial ground.

Furthermore, the donations collected during the holy month of Ramadan are not displayed on the mosque’s notice board to reflect how the donations were disbursed. With the present management board being questioned by concerned parties, files pertaining to former trustees appointments are starting to disappear from the Wakf Board; sources revealed.

Muslims who attend prayers at this iconic mosque seek a just response for the following questions from the Wakf Board and Tribunal:

How can these illegal members transact a trust’s monetary affairs amounting to millions of rupees with their banks, when their trusteeship is not recognised?

How could donations, especially during the Ramadhan Fast, be collected and accounts not displayed on the notice board?

How do files pertaining to former trustees appointments disappear from the Wakf Board?
Does the Wakf Tribunal run by the Minister of Muslim Religious Affairs serve any purpose?
Is this how they implement the Wakf Act to “establish a just Muslim society”?
By law, only Muslims can serve on this board and tribunal. Are the members of this board following instructions of their in-laws, friends, or rich businessmen who have vested interests?

,,Covid-19 and Sri Lanka’s wildlife: Every cloud has a silver lining,brunch," We all speak about the adverse effects of Covid-19. They are known; they are ongoing; they will likely be felt for years to come. But Covid-19 has brought with it a few positives as well. It has given many people a chance to reflect on how they live their lives, the choices they make, and how those choices can be improved.  

 Sri Lanka’s wildlife is legendary. Though we are one small island, we have an incredible range of biodiversity. Sadly, much of this renowned biodiversity is at risk. Finite land resources and an exploding population coupled with poorly managed development means much of the land that was previously wilderness has now been converted to land for human settlement as well as for agriculture, pushing the country’s precious natural heritage to the brink. 

 Sri Lanka’s wildlife resources have many stakeholders – the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) and the Department of Forest Conservation form a custodial and management role supported by others like conservationists, scientists, and tourism operators, as by and large, tourism in Sri Lanka is “nature-based” and the country’s tourism-dependent economy is heavily reliant on its wilderness and wildlife. Sadly, the latter rides on the coattails of Sri Lanka’s enviable biodiversity but has also been at great cost due to issues like over-visitation in wildlife parks. 



 The recent pandemic has been an eyeopener for many but also provided respite for the country’s wildlife within park borders. This month’s Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) Public Lecture focuses on these themes, where Environmental Foundation Ltd. (EFL) Director Rukshan Jayawardena addresses the windfall as a result of Covid-19 in terms of how we manage tourism in wildlife parks.  

 Jayawardena is a lifelong wildlife enthusiast and photographer who believes the role of photography in conservation is best served by adhering to standards and ethics. Jayawardena is a Founding Trustee at the Leopard Trust, Chairman of the Wilderness and Protected Areas Foundation, and Past President WNPS. Ahead of the WNPS Public Lecture,    The Morning Brunch    reached out to Jayawardena for a little more insight on how exactly the pandemic has been a boon to wildlife conservation.  

 
  The good side of Covid-19 for SL’s wildlife  

 Jayawardena explained that many of Sri Lanka’s wildlife parks, especially the popular parks like the Yala National Park and the Horton Plains National Park struggle with over-visitation in the name of tourism and that in the national context, tourism can often take precedence over protecting national parks and biodiversity.   

 “No long-term studies have been conducted on the over-visitation of wildlife parks,” Jayawardena said, adding: “And until you study and quantify and look at it through time, you can’t say anything for sure. However, the pandemic led to park closures and people being unable to visit in any number.”  

 This drastic drop in visitors to national parks for a period close to three months has given wildlife conservationists a unique opportunity to see how parks, and wildlife in particular, develop with little human interaction; it had very telling results.  

 “If you were to take Yala, for example, sightings of animals like leopards and other mammals have increased dramatically,” Jayawardena shared. “The duration of sightings and range of behaviours the animals show has also improved greatly. I see this as a direct result of the pressure from tourism being reduced, and really, it negates the need for a long-term study because in a very short time, without the pressure of tourism on the parks, you see a rebounding of the parks’ usual natures and much more relaxed behaviour from the animals.”  
 

 This phenomenon isn’t exclusive to Yala, which is Sri Lanka’s most well-known wildlife park. Jayawardena commented that this trend has been observed in most if not all wildlife parks across Sri Lanka.  

 The reduced numbers of visitors, particularly after lockdown, has also made park management much more effective. “It is much easier for the park management to manage and control tourist behaviour in reduced numbers,” Jayawardena said. “The Department of Wildlife is chronically understaffed, and high numbers of tourists in parks greatly interfere with the animals’ behaviour.” 

   
  The impacts of over-tourism on our wildlife  
    The key issues Jayawardena raised that were compounded by over-tourism were issues like roads and other development cutting through animal habitats and not only inhibiting the animals’ way of life but also decreasing the quality of tourism because animals are not used to humans and so end up staying away from the main roads or they only come within 10 m of the road, regardless of if the vegetation by the side of the road is what they normally eat. There is also tremendous interference to animals accessing waterholes because of vehicles coming by every 30 seconds-one minute. 

 “Just because a few animals are habituated and don’t show fear around humans doesn’t mean that they represent all the animals in the park,” Jayawardena stressed. “We can no longer say it doesn’t matter because it definitely makes a huge difference. It may not be fatal to them in any way, but roads that intersect parks so that animals have to cross them, combined with large numbers of visitors, can be traumatic to the animals.”  

Over-visitation in wildlife parks is an issue that needs to be addressed

 Jayawardena explained that the need for tourism to take precedence and the need to make money can lead to serious ecological consequences in the long term. “There is great value that animals and ecosystems provide. Symbiotic associations between animals and plants create things like the quality of our water and the quality of our soil – things we can’t achieve artificially without great inconvenience.”  

 Over-tourism can even sometimes lead to damaging environmental consequences in the name of improvement, Jayawardena shared. Because of the priority tourism takes, initiatives like restoring old water tanks and improving waterholes are undertaken with the idea of both providing animals with extra water as well as boosting tourism through animal sightings at these waterholes. 

 Jayawardena explained that the ecological impacts of manufacturing waterholes like this can have lasting adverse effects, citing South Africa’s similar initiatives as an example. In South Africa, water was pumped up form windmills into waterholes, even during rainless times where waterholes normally dried up completely. The result was that the natural vegetation around these waterholes was overgrazed by herbivores, basically creating mini ecological deserts in the areas surrounding these waterholes. South Africa has since ceased this practice, the result being that the strong animals survive, which is what is necessary. 

 “These are tried and tested evolutionary cycles. Sri Lanka still provides water to areas in waterless times. This needs to be done very judiciously, “Jayawardena explained, adding: “Especially doing things like restoring old water tanks on the boundaries of parks. In this sort of instance, we need to be prepared to protect this sort of area because poachers and illegal hunters are also automatically drawn to areas where animals are abundant.” 

   
  Getting things right for the future  
    Jayawardena shared that limiting the numbers of visitors to parks is a crucial way forward. There has to be a way of staggering visitors entering parks and a quota on how many visitors enter a certain park at any given time. Jayawardena said: “Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya headed an excellent park management study and made a proposal to the former Government on such measures. The study was conducted with all Sri Lanka’s wildlife stakeholders including the tourism industry. It looked at sustainably reducing visitors to parks in a way that could be beneficial to all. Now, proposals like this have a lot more strength because we can see how parks have fared with reduced numbers of visitors.”  

 Jayawardena noted the financial impact to reducing the numbers of visitors allowed into parks, both in terms of tourism as well as funding for the DWC, but he stressed that Sri Lanka’s wildlife is a living resource. “Our inability to control this is going to have a long-term impact on these ecosystems that may be irreversible over time. We may not see the impact immediately, but in 50 to 100 years, we may see the disappearance of animals in these parks because of how they are affected by noise and people.”  

 Jayawardena also shared that important steps for the future included the DWC developing better practices in parks and improving overall park management. Jayawardena also commented on the role political interference plays when developing these systems, especially when disciplinary action is taken against people who abuse wildlife.  

 “This is the time for us to take stock of what has been happening and decide the best way forward,” Jayawardena said, adding: “Sri Lanka’s wildlife is not any department’s personally owned thing. It’s something that is held in perpetual trust for future Sri Lankans and the world. Many of our wildlife parks are World Heritage Sites.” 

   

  Rukshan Jawayardena discusses the themes above and more at this month’s WNPS Public Lecture which takes place today, 22 October at 6 p.m. via Zoom and Facebook Live on the WNPS Facebook page.

,,The Birthplace : A new take on the universe and evolution,brunch," Science fiction is a rising genre in Sri Lanka’s literary scene. First gaining popularity as a literary genre among local authors with the work of Arthur C. Clarke, Sri Lanka now boasts a select number of serious science fiction authors whose work has been well received on both the local and international stage.
  
The Birthplace    is Sri Lanka’s latest science fiction offering. Written by veteran Attorney-at-Law Nanda Senanayake,    The Birthplace    is a thought-provoking piece of science fiction that explores alternate origins to our universe and life as we know it.   
   The Sunday Morning Brunch    sat down with Senanayake to find out more about    The Birthplace    and get some insight into Senanayake himself and what drew him to the field of science fiction.
  
  Below are excerpts from the interview. 
  Tell us about the man behind    The Birthplace.   
 I was born to a middle-class family in a rural village near Kegalle. I received my early education in St. Anthony's College in Kandy before my further education at Royal College Colombo. I then went on to gain admission to the Faculty of Science at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura to read for a degree in physical science while also simultaneously entering Sri Lanka Law College.
  
  My parents were more partial to me pursuing law and a legal career, and under their persuasion, I gave up my university education and focused only on my law studies, becoming an Attorney-at-Law in April 1988.
  
  I settled down in Kandy with my wife Rupika, pursuing a career in law and raising a family. I  have two children, one of whom is a doctor, and the other, a medical student. 
  What got you interested in science fiction?   
 My childhood was spent shuttling between the rural village in which I was born and the busy and urban Colombo 7 where I was boarded.
  
  During the school vacation, I would return to my village where there was hardly any electricity. I would spend most nights gazing at the stars, preoccupied with the mysteries and possibilities hidden in the vast skies.
  
  My interest in the stars guided me towards books and writings related to astronomy, which included science fiction. I became fascinated with science fiction because it constantly tries to look beyond the limits of the present towards the future, and attempts to find answers to the unknown. 
     What inspired    The Birthplace?    
 The storyline of    The Birthplace has    existed in my head for a long time. I had a long-standing interest in the gap between single-celled and multicellular beings. I read the history of the Earth about three years ago, and this brought together various scattered ideas and impressions I had together and gave me a setting in which to base my novel. 
  What are the themes    The Birthplace    examines?  
  The Birthplace    takes a serious look at the alternate origins of the universe – and, more close to home – what we know of the origins of life on planet Earth and evolution.
  
  Without revealing too much of the plot, let me just say that I noticed certain discrepancies in our understanding of evolution – certain blanks that couldn't be rationally explained, and T   he Birthplace    attempts to fill them. I also take a jab at the concept of immortality, and the true boundless horizons of mankind, if we were only able to comprehend how to unlock our fullest potential. 

   

 Is    The Birthplace    your first book?   Are there any others in the works? 

 I was always interested in writing. I started writing when I was 13 years old. I only started publishing my work recently; my published works include articles in the law journals.
  
  My ongoing works in science fiction include a sequel to    The Birthplace   , a book I call    The Devil's Dictionary in the 21st Century.    I have also been working on a book about legal maxims and phrases which may constitute around 7,000-plus pages. 

   

 As a new author entering the realm of Sri Lankan science fiction, what are your thoughts on the genre?  

  I think that this is a genre that has not seen many Sri Lankan writers, and that this needs to change.
  
  Science fiction has the unique attribute of allowing the imagination of the scientific mind to explore the very edge – and sometimes – over-the-edge theories that can forge the way forward for the future of mankind.
  
  Science fiction may be imaginary, but it is based on scientific fact, theories, and principles. The only difference between science and science fiction is that the latter doesn't exist yet. It is important to remember that man is only limited by his own imagination, and imagination based on science are dreams that really have the potential to come true. I would love to see more contributions by Sri Lankan authors along the lines of science fiction.  

  The Birthplace is published by Jam Fruit Tree Publications and is available for purchase at their bookshop in Colombo. The Birthplace is also available for delivery islandwide.

,,Riyaj Bathiudeen : Appeal Court dismisses writ application,news," The Court of Appeal dismissed the writ application filed by MP Rishad Bathiudeen’s brother, Riyaj Bathiudeen, seeking the prevention of his re-arrest by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). 

 The writ application was taken up before Appeal Court Justices Mahinda Samayawardhane and Arjuna Obeysekara last morning (21). Delivering the verdict, the judge bench decided to dismiss the petition without a fee.
 

 Riyaj was taken into custody on 14 April this year while in Puttalam. After five months of the arrest, he was released by the CID on 29 September. The CID cited lack of evidence to file a case against him. 

 Filing the writ application challenging the CID’s attempts to re-arrest him, Riyaj said he was apprehended on 14 April this year in connection to the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks and was held under custody for a long time on a detention order.

 The Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP), former Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) in charge of the CID Nuwan Wedasinghe, CID Director Prasanna de Alwis, CID Chief Inspector Mihindu Abeysinghe, and seven others were named as respondents. 

 He pointed out that during the detention period, the CID sleuths had conducted extensive investigations into his residences, properties, businesses, and bank accounts, following which he was subsequently released as there was no evidence to substantiate any criminal charges against him. 

 Despite this, various parties are pressurising for him to be re-arrested for political reasons, Riyaj stated. The petitioner had further noted that there is reasonable fear that he may be re-arrested as a result. 

 In the meantime, an interim petition was filed requesting the Court of Appeal to revoke the writ application put forward by Riyaj Bathiudeen to prevent him from being re-arrested.

,,Madush’s lawyer raises concerns : Writes letter to BASL President,news," By Maheesha Mudugamuwa 

 The lawyer of Samarasinghe Arachchige Madush Lakshitha alias Makandure Madush, who was shot dead in crossfire between the Police and other suspected underworld figures at the Maligawatte Housing Complex on Tuesday (20), raised concerns over the moving of his client from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to the Colombo Crime Division (CCD), contrary to specifications in the detention order (DO) issued in July this year. 

 In a letter written to the President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL), the lawyer, Chaminda Athukorala stressed that his client was held on a DO under the Prevention of Terrorism Act No. 48 of 1979 (PTA), that was renewed from time to time. 

 According to him, the last such DO was dated 28 July 2020 and was to expire on 28 October 2020. 

 “You are aware that in terms of the PTA, such a DO could only be made for a period of 18 months. Accordingly, my client's continued detention was to lapse on 28 October 2020. Be that as it may, you are aware that the DO in terms of the law must specify the place of detention. The said place of detention for the DO numbered above, was the CID. However, illegally and arbitrarily, my client was moved from the CID to the CCD on or around 16 October 2020. The said move was illegal and was precluded (   sic   ) from the incident which took place this morning (20),” Athukorala stated in his letter to the BASL President dated Tuesday. 

 Requesting the BASL President to urgently take up the matter with the relevant authorities and condemn the action in the strongest possible terms, Athukolara stated: “Fearing such imminent threat to the life of my client, his wife, upon our advice, wrote to the Director of the CCD on 17 October 2020 and informed them by way of a phone call regarding the ruse by state agencies.” The letter then specified the fear and apprehension Madush’s wife endured as a result of the manner and mode of the murder of her husband whilst in police custody. 

 “It is recognised that as a civilised society which respects the rule of law, the recent spate of murders whilst in the custody of law enforcement agencies have gone unpunished with no investigation into the veracity of the narrative being forced down to the public. 

 “It is recognised that no civilised society should condone this behaviour. You are aware that the narrative put forth today by the law enforcement agencies regarding the murder of my client, is on the face of it, a pure fabrication,” the letter stated further.

 By Maheesha Mudugamuwa 

 The required equipment for the successful operation of PCR machines imported to the country by the Health Ministry was yet to be imported, and as a result, two such imported machines were not operational at present,    The Morning    learnt. 

 According to a well-informed source at the Ministry of Health, who wished to remain anonymous, the two machines in question were given to the Jaffna and Batticaloa Hospitals. However, since the additional equipment that would deem the machines operational had not been imported, these two machines were non-operational at present. 

 He told    The Morning    that the other three machines were distributed to the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) in Angoda, Katunayake, and Colombo, and were currently operating with the available equipment. 

 As a result, the expected increase in the number of tests as a result of the addition of the five machines is now said to be around 400 per day, despite the initial target being 7,500 from the existing 3,000-odd per day, he claimed. 

 It was also reported earlier that there were delays in releasing a number of PCR machines ordered by the Ministry of Health that reached the Colombo Port. As learnt by    The Morning   , this was a result of delays in the relevant documents being issued by the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA). 

 When contacted by    The Morning   , NMRA Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Dr. Kamal Jayasinghe denied that there was any delay on their part, as all the relevant documentation had been issued to get the machines released from the Port.

,,Sri Lanka’s charitable organisations need more govt. collaboration: New study,business," Only 11% of social delivery organisations (SDOs) in Sri Lanka have contracts with the government, compared to the Asian average of 26%, while foreign funding is increasingly scarce with the rise in Sri Lanka’s per capita income, according to a new report. 

 “Today, 71% of Sri Lankan SDOs surveyed receive foreign funding, making up 54% of their budget. With Sri Lanka having been classified as a lower middle-income country in 2010 and upper middle-income in 2019, foreign funding is increasingly being redeployed to low-income countries,"" notes the Centre for Asian Philanthropy and Society’s (CAPS) in the second edition of its Doing Good Index (DGI2020). 

 The study was conducted in 2019,   and Sri Lanka has subsequently been reclassified as a lower middle-income country. However, it is still placed at the higher end of lower middle-income countries list, and therefore it is believed that diminishing foreign funding will continue to be an issue. 

 The study adds that only 16% of SDOs surveyed in Sri Lanka receive government grants, half the average proportion across Asia, and that government grants make up only around 2% of the average Sri Lankan SDO budget. 

 In light of these figures, the Doing Good Index advocates greater collaboration between the Sri Lankan Government and SDOs, as government procurement can be an important source of growth for the social sector. 

 “Only 11% of SDOs surveyed in Sri Lanka have contracts with the government, compared to the Asia average of 26%,” it said, adding that most SDOs continue to find procurement processes lacking in transparency, not just in Sri Lanka but in Asia as a whole. 

 The Doing Good Index (DGI2020) examines the vital role of the social sector, and how Asian countries help or hinder it. It identifies opportunities for the Sri Lankan Government to do more for society, as well as how private/corporate donations must play their part in meeting people’s needs.  

 “The global pandemic has accelerated the decline in foreign funding among local social delivery organisations, and there is a growing reliance on domestic philanthropy more than ever to ensure that community needs are met,” said Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka Research Economist Kithmina Hewage. “It is crucial for the social sector to work closely with the government and corporates to increase domestic funds that not only address immediate Covid-19-related needs, but also longer term needs related to disaster management, environmental conservation, poverty alleviation, and post-conflict reconciliation.” 

 The Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka (IPS) is the local partner for the Sri Lankan component of the study.  

 In terms of regulatory oversight, the study acknowledges that the establishment of the National Secretariat for Non-Governmental Organisations in 1996 made all necessary regulations easily accessible through its official website, and that more recently, it introduced an online platform for registration. However, it notes that the oversight of the organisation has changed frequently between different government ministries, resulting in a lack of continuity and consistency. Furthermore, it says 41% of SDOs in Sri Lanka find laws pertaining to the social sector difficult to understand. 

 On the tax front, country experts in 14 out of 18 economies, including Sri Lanka, have said they have difficulty in accurately identifying relevant tax policies. Going further, 70% of Sri Lankan SDOs believe it is difficult to claim available tax deductions, according to the study. 

 On the positive side, the study found that in Sri Lanka, nearly 80% of SDOs report occasional or regular participation in policymaking. Furthermore, 51% of Sri Lankan SDOs receive corporate funding, making up 16% of their average budget, while 40% of Sri Lankan SDOs receive in-kind services from corporates or partner with them to raise awareness of social issues.  

 The DGI2020 research surveyed 2,189 SDOs and interviewed 145 country experts across 18 Asian economies: Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. It examines regulatory regimes, tax incentives, procurement procedures, and sociocultural conditions.

,,20A to be voted on in Parliament today,news,"
The vote on the draft bill of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution is scheduled for this evening (22).

Members of Parliament commenced the debate on the proposed bill last morning (21) and will proceed with the debate from 10.00 am to 7.30 pm for the second consecutive day today.

The Committee Stage of the proposed 20th Amendment is expected to commence tomorrow at 7.30 pm post the debate and the legislators will subsequently vote on the draft bill.

Minister of Justice, President’s Counsel Ali Sabry, presenting the draft bill to the House yesterday (21), said it will be amended to limit the Cabinet of Ministers to 30 portfolios with another 40 non-Cabinet portfolios, and the Emergency Bills will be limited to cases of national disaster or events affecting national security, among other amendments.

Delivering his speech to the House, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa had said the 20th Amendment to the Constitution is brought into force to remove the 19th Amendment which turned the country into anarchy.

It is reported that Serjeant-at-Arms of Parliament Narendra Fernando had informed the Secretary to the Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medicine to take steps in order to allow Vanni District MP Rishad Bathiudeen to attend the parliamentary sittings today (22) and tomorrow (23).

The Serjeant-at-Arms took this measure following an order given by Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena at the Committee on Parliamentary Business held yesterday.

The United National Party (UNP) meanwhile said it is gravely concerned by the government’s decision to continue with the presentation of the 20th Amendment to Parliament, and the subsequent debate, despite the Supreme Court’s determination that several clauses of this amendment require a referendum by the people.

The UNP called on all Members of Parliament, including those from the government benches, to vote against or refrain from voting in favour of this bill which “threatens the democratic foundation that Sri Lanka has been built upon.”

MP of Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Kavinda Jayawardena has stated that the Opposition members intend to give their all to defeat the draft bill.

Meanwhile, State Minister Shehan Semasinghe said a group of Opposition members have agreed to support the government in the 20th Amendment vote.

,,Appeal allowed against proscription of LTTE in UK,news,"he United Kingdom’s Proscribed Organisation Appeal Commission (POAC) has allowed an appeal against a decision of the Secretary of State dated 8 March 2019 to refuse an application submitted by Arumugam &amp; Others to remove the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) from the list of organizations proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000.

The appellants, Arumugam &amp; Others, are members of the Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam (TGTE), which is proscribed in Sri Lanka but not in the UK.

The appellants submitted that the 2019 Decision was flawed for three reasons:
1. The OPEN materials do not support a belief that LTTE is currently concerned in terrorism.
2. The OPEN materials do not support the exercise of the Secretary of State’s discretion.
3. The continued proscription of the LTTE is an unjustified interference with articles 10 and 11 rights of those, including the appellants, who are committed to independence for Tamils in Sri Lanka.

The appellants further submitted that the Secretary of State cannot rely on any respect on any material if the POAC finds that it was obtained by torture.

Speaking to the media, Wijewardena stated that the 20th Amendment, which was a threat to the country’s Democracy, was being introduced to help solidify the position of the Rajapaksa family. Accusing the government of conspiring with the Speaker to ensure the smooth passage of the amendment, Wijewardena urged all Members of Parliament to forgo their privileges and stand on the side of Democracy.

He went on to state that the government was attempting to white-wash the 20th Amendment, by equating its adoption to ensuring development in the country. Instead, the Deputy Leader said that after the 20th Amendment is adopted the Parliament would cease to be an effective institution as the Parliamentarians had chosen to empower a dictator.

Wijewardena also raised the issue of allowing dual citizens to enter Parliament, explaining that in the event a dual citizen is elected to Parliament the public would find their representative’s loyalty torn between their country of birth and their adopted country. This would place the national security of the country in grave danger.

He urged the government to put aside their desire for power, and ensure the safety of the public in the face of the growing threat from COVID-19. Questioning why the government had chosen to proceed with the debate on the amendment while the rest of the country was slowly being locked down, Wijewardena accused the Minister of Health of hiding the true facts of the situation.

Sanjeewa Seneviratne, speaking about the recent petitions filed by the UNP against the 20th Amendment, highlighted the fact that only the UNP was able to successfully retain the independence of the Election Commission. Drawing attention to clause 22 of the 20th Amendment, Seneviratne explained that had it been introduced it would see the powers of the Election Commission reduced to observer status.

However, they stated that it was the UNP’s success at the courts which saw the Supreme Court uphold their argument and rule that this clause would require a 2/3rd majority in Parliament and subsequently a referendum.",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,20A will open path to dictatorship: Ruwan,news,0,1603363106,0,102187,,

,,Lankan students abroad call for quick end to political uncertainty,news," A group of Sri Lankan students studying abroad expressed their deep concern over Sri Lanka's ongoing constitutional and political crisis in a letter calling for President Maithripala Sirisena to rescind his decision to prorogue Parliament and for all those involved in the ""coup"" to be held accountable for their actions, among other requests. 
 Following is the full text of the letter: 
 We are a group of Sri Lankan students currently pursuing our education overseas. We write today to express our deep concern about Sri Lanka’s ongoing constitutional and political crisis.  
 Since 1931 Sri Lanka has had an imperfect and fragile, yet electorally and legally mandated, democracy. On Friday the 26th of October, for the first time since Sri Lanka’s independence, an unconstitutional and illegal transfer of power occurred. President Maithripala Sirisena, violating his oath of office and the mandate given to him on January 8th 2015, attempted to appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa, Member of Parliament for the Kurunegala District, as Prime Minister. This was unconstitutional. The 19th Amendment deleted the President’s power to remove the Prime Minister at will. While the President still appoints the Prime Minister, he has no implied power of removal since this is now governed by explicit provisions in the Constitution. Moreover, the withdrawal of the UPFA from the national government makes no difference: the Constitution does not provide that Cabinet ceases to function, and therefore that the Prime Minister loses his position, when one party in a national government withdraws its support.  
 In any event, there is a democratic means of settling this question - a test of confidence on the floor of Parliament. Yet President Sirisena and Mr. Rajapaksa did not propose a motion of no-confidence or engineer a defeat of the Budget to remove Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. Indeed even after Mr. Rajapaksa’s illegal appointment, President Sirisena decided to prorogue Parliament, demonstrating what was clear from the beginning: Mr. Rajapaksa does not have the confidence of a majority of the representatives of the people. His covert appointment, the illegal attempt to remove Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, the suspension of Parliament without consulting the Speaker, and the mob-led take-over of State media institutions make it clear that this is a coup d’etat.  
 The resort to violence and coercion is a chilling reminder of what dictatorship looks like. The coup is being followed by a return to the norms of self-censorship, violence and fear that were characteristic of Rajapaksa-era politics. State media institutions were stormed in the night and security for the Prime Minister and Ministers  arbitrarily withdrawn. Moreover, many private media stations are already becoming vehicles for misinforming the public and spreading disinformation. By referring to Mr. Rajapaksa as Prime Minister they are renouncing the constitution and the democratic process, and normalizing an illegitimate regime.  
 Despite some successes, the government of national unity led by President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe has failed to stand by many of its commitments on democracy, corruption and justice. Yet these failures do not justify an illegal power grab. Sri Lankans, regardless of political affiliation or their opinion of the Yahapalanaya government, have a duty to rally around democracy and the constitution. Therefore, we call for:  
 1. President Maithripala Sirisena to rescind his order proroguing Parliament.  
 2. The Speaker of Parliament, Karu Jayasuriya, to immediately summon Parliament.  
 3. A vote to ascertain whether the government of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe commands the confidence of Parliament.  
 4. All those responsible for this coup to be held accountable for their actions.  
 5. All public servants to uphold the Constitution and fulfill their obligations set out in law.  
    
 The unprecedented events of last week have reinforced the fragile nature of our democracy. They are also part of a broader problem in our political culture. Once more, power is being used purely for political gain rather than towards building people-centered institutions and an inclusive and democratic political culture. These acts damage the health of institutions and processes that sustain democracy, pluralism and rights. They will have a permanent impact on the future of Sri Lanka’s youth.  
 As students of different ethnicities and religions, institutional affiliations and professional backgrounds we, the undersigned, condemn these recent developments, encourage others to make their voices heard, and commit ourselves to using our education to build a more just, fair and democratic Sri Lanka.

,,"Crisis a credit negative, could have lasting impact: Moody's",business,"International ratings agency Moody’s has flagged concern over Sri Lanka’s policy uncertainty and future debt repayments amidst the current political crisis.

Moody’s analyst Matthew Circosta has said the crisis was credit negative for Sri Lanka and could undermine the country’s ability to refinance external debt early next year at affordable costs.

“And at a time when global financial markets are turbulent, uncertainty about the direction of future policy could have a large and lasting negative impact on international investor confidence,” Circosta added.

Earlier this month Moody's named Sri Lanka as one of three smaller emerging economies most vulnerable to refinancing risks, because it faces a combination of large upcoming repayments and low foreign currency reserves.

In July, Moody’s affirmed Sri Lanka’s foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings at B1 and maintained a negative outlook. It said that affirming the rating at B1 reflected Sri Lanka’s progress in implementing the planned reform programme, which entails fiscal consolidation and a build-up of foreign exchange reserves buffers, ahead of the end of the IMF Extended Fund Facility program in June 2019. It also noted that Sri Lanka has moderate per capita income levels and stronger institutions relative to many similarly-rated sovereigns.",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,"Crisis a credit negative, could have lasting impact: Moody's",business,0,1540794172,0,10222,,

 MP Bathiudeen, who is currently in remand custody, arrived at the Parliament premises wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). 

 The former Minister was transported to Parliament in a prison bus accompanied by several prison guards. 

 He was reportedly allocated a special seat within the chamber as well. 

 Bathiudeen, who was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Monday (19), was remanded until 27 October by the court. 

 He is accused of allegedly misusing 222 buses belonging to the state-owned Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) for transporting internally displaced persons (IDPs) from Puttalam to polling stations in Silavathurai, Mannar, during the 2019 presidential election. 

 Serjeant-at-Arms of Parliament, Narendra Fernando yesterday informed the Secretary to the Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medicine to take steps to allow the Vanni District Parliamentarian to participate in the sittings of Parliament yesterday and today (23).

,,Proscription of LTTE : UK court allows appeal,news," The UK’s Proscribed Organisation Appeal Commission (POAC) has allowed an appeal against a decision of the Secretary of State, dated 8 March 2019, to refuse an application submitted by Arumugam and Others to remove the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) from the list of organisations proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000. 

 The appellants, Arumugam and Others, are members of the Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam (TGTE) which is proscribed in Sri Lanka but not in the UK. 

 The appellants submitted that the 2019 decision was flawed for three reasons: 

            The OPEN materials do not support a belief that LTTE is currently concerned in terrorism  
            The OPEN materials do not support the exercise of the Secretary of State’s discretion  
            The continued proscription of the LTTE is an unjustified interference with Articles 10 and 11 rights of those, including the appellants, who are committed to independence for Tamils in Sri Lanka  

 The appellants further submitted that the Secretary of State cannot rely on any respect on any material if the POAC finds that it was obtained by torture. 

 The POAC deemed that the 2019 decision was flawed, and proceeded to allow the appeal. 

 Moreover, the POAC will hold a further hearing about relief as requested by the parties and therefore nothing about relief was mentioned in allowing the appeal.

,,Wreckage clearance of collapsed Kandy building to cost Rs 2.8m,news," By Sarah Hannan 

 The Kandy District Disaster Management Co-ordination Unit (DDMCU) has estimated that a sum of Rs. 2.8 million would be required to clear the wreckage that was caused by the collapsed five-storey building in Buwelikada, Kandy on 20 September.  

 Speaking to    The Morning   , Kandy DDMCU Assistant Director I.A.K. Ranaweera said: “The clearance of rubble commenced on Monday (20) under the technical guidance of the National Building Research Organsiation (NBRO) and the Kandy Municipal Council. We have estimated that the whole operation would take at least a period of three weeks.”  

 Ranaweera also noted that the wreckage needed to be cleared to obtain segments of the building’s foundation to assist the NBRO to file in their further observations on the root cause of the building’s collapse and to take necessary legal action against the owner of the building. 

 Furthermore, Ranaweera noted that it will also assist the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) and the NBRO technical teams to ascertain whether the building collapse was caused by a natural occurrence or due to the neglect of building regulations stipulated by the Kandy Municipal Council’s building department, so that appropriate action could be filed; whether appropriate compensation could be arranged for the families that were impacted by the collapsed building by the Government in case of a natural disaster; and whether litigations would be filed against Anura Lewke to pay out the relevant compensation and cost for clearing the rubble.  

 “At the moment no compensation has been released to any parties over the damages that they have sustained following the collapse. There are about three families that have been relocated at present, and they are requesting that they be allowed to return to their homes. We can only allow them to come back after the site is cleared and further investigations are completed,” Ranaweera elaborated.  

 The DMC, the NBRO, and the Kandy Municipal Council are jointly involved in removing the rubble from the site of disaster.  

 Necessary budgets have been approved to get a head start over the clearance through the Kandy Municipal Council at present.  

 The preliminary inspection conducted by the NBRO team confirmed that the building had collapsed due to poor construction practices.

 Minister of Industries Wimal Weerawansa, in line with the Government’s new industry and trade policies, proposed to consider Lanka Salusala Ltd. for textile purchasing to promote the institution.  

 “We are encouraging state organisations to consider Lanka Salusala Ltd. as a purchasing agent in the coming months when they are to purchase materials to tailor uniforms, supply necessary curtains for the state institutes, etc.” Weerawansa explained. 

 During Monday’s (19) cabinet decision announcements, it was announced that a 15% purchasing priority will be given to Lanka Salusala Ltd. against the other procumbent agencies. 

 Furthermore, a study is to be conducted by the Ministry to understand the demands for textiles in public sector institutions and create business partnerships between the local textile manufactures and the institutions, thus creating new business opportunities. 

 The plan is to work in synergy with the five-year project plan that has been devised by the Government to improve local industries as well as the market share for locally produced goods within the country itself.

,,Illegal constructions in Bolgoda Lake | CEA awaits police reports,news," By Sarah Hannan 

 The Central Environmental Authority (CEA) is to work closely with the Police Environment Protection Unit and the divisional secretariats in and around the Bolgoda Lake area to identify the illegal constructions and land reclamation brought under the spotlight last week,  The Morning  learnt. 

 Speaking to  The Morning , CEA Natural Resources Management Director Priyangani Gunathilake said: “We are awaiting a detailed report from the stakeholders tasked to carry out investigations. So far, we have identified six such constructions and the Police are assisting us with conducting the necessary investigations into the entities responsible for the construction of such buildings in the Bolgoda Lake area.” 

 Gunathilake noted that after the CEA is produced with the full investigation reports, they will take necessary action to evict the illegal occupants in addition to the necessary legal action against such entities. 

 In terms of land reclamation that has taken place surrounding the banks of the lake, the CEA will also be conducting an environmental impact assessment (EIA), and based on the findings, they will take action against environment polluters and destructors. 

 Minister of Environment Mahinda Amaraweera last week visited the Bolgoda Lake area with a team from the Ministry, the CEA, and the divisional secretariats to inspect the extent of the damage to the ecosystem caused by the illegal constructions and land reclamation. 

 Following his visit, he remarked that about 90% of the constructions that were on the banks of the Bolgoda Lake were found to be illegal, lacking the necessary clearance from the CEA, or that EIAs were conducted only prior to construction, thereby causing considerable destruction to the biodiversity of the area. 

 The Bolgoda Lake and its surrounding areas are frequented by holidaymakers and the area is scattered with holiday homes and villas. It is also a hotspot that is frequented by environmentalists and nature lovers to observe the area’s biodiversity.

 Only around 100 hospital beds allocated for Covid-19 patients remain at present due to the sudden resurgence of the second wave of the coronavirus with the identification of more than 2,000 infected persons in a single and the largest-ever cluster created in the country, according to the health authorities.  
Deputy Director General of Health Services (Public Health) Dr. Hemantha Herath told the media that 2,341 Covid-19 patients have been identified in connection with the Minuwangoda Covid-19 cluster and they are being treated at 23 hospitals across Sri Lanka.  

 So far 6,028 cases of Covid-19 have been reported from Sri Lanka, he said.  

 Dr. Herath added that 2,587 hospital beds have been prepared for Covid-19 patients and 2,433 of them have been filled with patients. He further noted that if the number of Covid-19 patients increases further in the future, more hospitals will be allocated to treat Covid-19 patients.  

 He said that 8,270 PCR tests have been conducted in the last 72 hours and those tests are still in progress.  

 Meanwhile, Ministry of Health Chief Epidemiologist Dr. Sudath Samaraweera told the media that the Government does not hide information about Covid-19 from the public and that such information cannot be withheld.  

 Refuting the allegations, Dr. Samaraweera said that the PCR test was accepted by the world as the best way to identify Covid-19 patients and that the rumours circulating about its condition were false.  

 He said that all the Covid-19 patients reported so far are connected to the Brandix factory. He said that the first, second, and third associates had contracted the disease and no further condition had been observed.  

 So far, no outbreak of the disease has been observed in the society and it has become clear that it is spreading through the relevant cluster, he assured.

,,Voting rights for Lankan expats : Election laws to be amended,news," By Maheesha Mudugamuwa 

 A select committee would be appointed by the Government to amend the election laws and to seek the possibilities for granting voting rights to Sri Lankans living abroad.  

 At a meeting held between Prime Minister (PM) Mahinda Rajapaksa and Election Commission (EC) officials to discuss the strategic plans of the EC at Temple Trees recently, number of issues were brought up including the control of election expenses, the setting up of polling stations with facilities for the disabled, the e-voting system under special projects, and the amending of election guarantees.  

 Further, the granting of a separate date for those who are unable to vote on the day of the election, updating the electoral roll every three months to give them the right to vote as soon as they return, and the granting of voting rights to Sri Lankans living abroad have been discussed at the meeting.  

 At the meeting, PM Rajapaksa has told the election officials that a select committee will be appointed in the future to amend the election laws and grant voting rights to Sri Lankans living abroad.

He said they wished to combine the relaxation of the mind, body, and soul in creating an environment where one is able to relax their body while also enjoying the secluded sights and sounds of their venue and sipping on a glass of beverage. 

 For Rs. 4,900, the event will include the one-and-a-half-hour yoga session with Aaron, with alternating breaks to sip on two glasses of beverage, followed by jazz and lunch. Dushyanth stated that Rare Bar + Kitchen takes pride in their extensive brunch menu, from which guests can order anything and enjoy a nice relaxing meal as their live jazz band “Three Oh” serenades them. 

 Speaking about his practice and what guests can expect, Aaron took us through what you will be experiencing during the session. He said the session will begin with a powerful Prāṇāyāma breathing technique that is designed to elevate the oxygen levels in the body to prepare you for what lies ahead. Aaron will lead a fun-filled “All-Levels Vinyasa” flow that is designed to increase the functional range in your practice and your body. 

 Adding that you will then follow the vigorous 60-minute yang yoga flow, with a much-needed 30-minute yin yoga sequence while sipping on a glass of beverage, he said that you can expect to “dive deep into true relaxation as we end our practice that will leave you to an absolute state of bliss”. 

 Dushyanth went on to share how and where they usually conduct the event, adding that they usually host this event in the outdoor space at the venue – the courtyard space next to the pool which can accommodate up to 15 people comfortably. On an occasion where it rains, they are able to move the event into their Residence Suite. He said usually, as they alternate between the yoga sessions and the two glasses of beverage, the event as a whole takes about one hour and 40 minutes, adding that they provide shower and changing room facilities, if one wishes to get changed after the yoga session and before having their meal. 

 Dushyanth said the event Vinyasa and Wine Aaron Wickramasekara is one of many attempts by their management to hopefully boost their sales and promote the restaurant as the pandemic has greatly affected their operations. He said this event is but one of many promotions they have lined up for their guests. Since having restarted operations in July, they have made efforts to come up with appealing concepts that are also beneficial for their clientele to provide them a worthwhile experience.

,,Central Bank keeps policy rate unchanged,business," The Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), at its meeting held on 21 October 2020, decided to maintain the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank at their current levels of 4.50% and 5.50%, respectively, thereby continuing the prevailing accommodative monetary policy stance. 

 Announcing the decision, the Central Bank noted the decline in overall market lending rates, following the unprecedented monetary easing measures taken by the Central Bank thus far during the year, and said it expects the broadbased downward adjustment in market lending rates to continue, thereby ensuring affordable credit flows to productive sectors of the economy in the prevailing low-inflation environment. 

 The specific reasons provided for the decision are as follows. 
Global monetary policy
 The global economy, as per the World Economic Outlook (WEO) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), released in October 2020, is projected to contract by 4.4% in 2020. The outlook for growth in 2020 is less severe than the IMF’s previous forecast, supported by large-scale policy stimuli implemented worldwide. However, the recent surge in Covid-19 cases globally has prompted several countries to reimpose lockdowns, which may dampen global growth prospects. Against this background, most central banks across the globe are expected to continue their accommodative monetary policy stance in the foreseeable future. 
 Sri Lankan economic trajectory
 The release of GDP estimates for the second quarter of 2020 by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) has been delayed. It is likely that the second quarter of 2020 has recorded a greater contraction than in the first quarter, followed by a recovery in the third quarter of the year, CBSL said. 

 “However, as per the DCS, the unemployment rate, which was estimated at 5.7% in the first quarter of 2020, has declined to 5.4% in the second quarter. The level of employment has also remained broadly unchanged in the second quarter compared to the large decline reported for the first quarter. These suggest that economic activity has remained without much deterioration in the second quarter. Other developments observed in leading indicators and high-frequency data since the relaxation of the countrywide lockdown measures suggest that Sri Lanka is on a path towards economic revival. The unexpected Covid-19 cluster that has emerged recently could somewhat affect this momentum in the near term, but the expeditious measures that are being taken by the Government to contain the spread could limit this impact,” it said. 
External sector 
 Better than expected outcomes in the external sector, as reflected by the incoming data, are indicative of the resilience of the external sector amidst growing worldwide uncertainties triggered by the outbreak of Covid-19. Alongside the improvement in earnings from merchandise exports, restrictions imposed on the importation of non-essential goods and low crude oil prices helped narrow the trade deficit substantially during the nine months ended September 2020. Services exports, excluding the tourism sector, continued to record a healthy growth led by computer and logistic services-related activities. Workers’ remittances continued to record a notable acceleration since June 2020. In the meantime, Sri Lanka successfully settled the International Sovereign Bond (ISB) of $ 1 billion matured in early October 2020, continuing the unblemished record on debt servicing. The exchange rate remained stable and the depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee against the US dollar is limited to 1.5% thus far during the year. In this background, the Central Bank said it continued to purchase a sizeable volume of foreign exchange from the domestic market. Gross official reserves were estimated at $ 6.7 billion at end-September 2020, which provided an import cover of 4.6 months. 
 Inflation 
 Headline inflation, based on the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI), decelerated in September 2020 on a Year-on-Year (YoY) basis, while there was some acceleration in the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI)-based headline inflation due to the rise in food prices. Meanwhile, core inflation based on both CCPI and NCPI continued to remain low, reflecting subdued demand conditions. The CBSL said it expects the recent increase in food prices to be short-lived, supported by domestic supply side developments as well as the recent reduction in prices of several essential goods. Accordingly, inflation is expected by CBSL to remain broadly within the desired range of 4-6% in the near term and over the medium term with appropriate policy measures. 
Interest rates 
 In response to the monetary easing measures effected to bring down borrowing costs of businesses and households, both market deposit and lending rates adjusted notably so far during the year. The Average Weighted Prime Lending Rate (AWPR) declined to historic lows in recent weeks, while new lending rates also adjusted downward in line with the expectations of the Central Bank. The imposition of lending rate caps on selected financial products in August 2020 has also helped bring down the overall lending rates in the market. Furthermore, CBSL said space remains for market lending rates to decline, particularly with the high level of excess liquidity in the money market, which is deposited with the Central Bank at the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) of 4.50% at present. 
 Private sector credit 
 Following the contractions recorded in the preceding three months, credit disbursed to the private sector expanded notably in August 2020, reflecting the impact of low lending rates as well as concessional credit schemes. 

 “The expansion of credit to the private sector is expected to continue in the period ahead, despite the recent rise in Covid19 infections, which is expected to be short-lived. Meanwhile, the overall domestic credit continued to expand sharply, driven by the substantial increase in credit to the public sector. Accordingly, the growth of broad money further accelerated in August 2020,” CBSL said. 

 In consideration of the current and expected macroeconomic developments highlighted above, the Monetary Board of the CBSL had been of the view that the current accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate. Accordingly, the Board decided to maintain the SDFR and the SLFR of the Central Bank at their current levels of 4.50% and 5.50%, respectively. The Central Bank said it will continue to monitor domestic and global macroeconomic and financial market developments and take further measures appropriately to ensure that the economy promptly reverts to a sustained high real GDP growth path, while maintaining inflation in the 4-6% range under its flexible inflation targeting framework.

,,Covid-19 | Three growing clusters,focus," 
           Yet to identify source of origin  
           PHIs note lapses in procedures  
 
 By Sarah Hannan    

 Just over 20 days since an apparel worker affiliated to a factory based in   Minuwangoda tested positive for the novel coronavirus, there have been three noticeable clusters that have continued to grow in numbers. 

 As at the end of   Thursday (22), there were 2,894 cases   from the growing clusters that were reported. From the   Minuwangoda factory, a total of 1,293 had been tested positive, out of which 180 tested positive after they were placed in quarantine centres (QCs). Close contacts of the Minuwangoda factory workers who contracted the virus stood at 1,114. 

 While only one case was reported from a factory in   Welisara, since 9 October, 58 workers from an apparel factory in Katunayake had tested positive for Covid-19 after being subjected to PCR testing. A total of 41 of their close contacts had later tested positive as well. 

 The latest cluster sprung up from the   Peliyagoda Fish Market on Wednesday (21), reporting 237 Covid-19-positive persons. This prompted the Government to impose quarantine curfew in six police divisions in the Colombo District until further notice. As at the end of Thursday, 75 close contacts of the Peliyagoda Fish Market cluster tested positive for Covid-19. 

 In the case of the   Peliyagoda Fish Market, this is the second time a public space became the ground of infection to many involved in the fisheries sector. 

 The remaining patients who tested positive were 70 returnees observing quarantine at the QCs, three minor staff from the National Hospital of Sri Lanka, a nurse at Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children, and two persons from unknown sources who were residents from   Andiambalama, Katunayake.

 Point at no one 

 While the origins of any of them are not yet determined, there have been many probabilities thrown around by subject matter experts. National Operation Centre for Prevention of Covid-19 Outbreak Head Lt. Gen. Shavendra Silva last week said the apparel worker would have contracted the virus from a person who had returned from overseas, who may or may not have undergone the quarantine protocols and may or may not have been detected possibly due being asymptomatic. 

 Meanwhile, Public Health Inspectors’ Union of Sri Lanka (PHIUSL) Secretary M. Balasuriya said that there were some lapses in the procedures which were not keenly followed by the public nor the authorities. He highlighted the incident that took place in Matara when the Russian flight crew members had not followed quarantine regulations. 

 “The delay in gazetting health regulations and then politicians and ministers not following the health guidelines gave a false sense of security to the public for over six months.   Finally, the health guidelines were gazetted, but that too happened when the cluster that was created from the Divulapitiya (Minuwangoda) incident started to spread like wildfire,” Balasuriya noted. 

 During the period before the health guidelines were gazetted, the PHIs and even the Police had had to face somewhat of a challenge when they had to firmly remind people to follow health guidelines or ask them to self-isolate as instructed. 

 “What is the point if people are not following the basic guidelines of wearing the face mask when they are in public spaces? Some have the habit of wearing it on their chin, or have it in the pocket or bag but would not wear it. Since the latest resurgence of the virus and several clusters, we had to request the public transport providers, shop owners, and supermarkets to constantly remind them to wear the masks properly, or not to take in their vehicles or to their business premises,” Balasuriya added. 

 He noted that if people take necessary precautions and look out for their own safety, many can avoid contracting the virus. He also reiterated the importance of seeking medical attention if one shows symptoms or if they get to know they were in close contact with a person who had the virus. 

 Scientific data no match for military tactics 

 Sri Lanka   Academy of Health Professionals (AHPSL) President Ravi Kumudesh stated that there is a lack of fact presentation or explanation about Covid-19 in a community medicine terminology to prove that the virus is not at a community spread level. 

 “We are also faced with doubts as to how state intelligence mechanisms and military tactics are used to define whether or not the virus has reached the level of cluster spread or community spread. However, since Sri Lanka still does not test for antibodies that are generated in a person who was infected and has recovered from Covid-19, it is not possible to obtain data on naturally cured infections,” Kumudesh elaborated. 

 Even using state intelligence services, patients can be tracked only by the data provided through PCR test reports. So even with such a tracking system, finding the origins of the disease or tracing the patient’s exposure history may turn up some cases to be negative and then there might be sporadic spread of the virus taking place in society. 

 Also, in preparing the public in accordance with the fundamental parameters of the World Health Organisation (WHO) for the control of Covid-19, we must be prepared for the “most dangerous conjecture”. 

 “By repeatedly stating that there is no community spread at present, there is a high probability that the situation will become extremely dangerous, with people turning their attention to the cluster of cases that some authorities continuously harp on and falling back to a relaxed safety policy based on their own general assumptions that is otherwise detrimental in taking some control of the spread of the disease,” Kumudesh opined. 

 This is the best course of action, both scientifically and practically, to treat as a community spread, especially since the general public does not make decisions based on intelligence information or tactics. 

 “About 80% of Covid-19 infections are considered to be asymptomatic or will naturally recover from the virus infection, which PCR tests would fail to identify. Thus, we may have unknowingly missed a significant   amount of unrecognised patients in the community due to the fact that patients who may be randomly placed in the community are not subjected to antiretroviral as described above,” Kumudesh added. 

 Strict regulations in curfew areas 

 Police Media Spokesperson Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Ajith Rohana, when inquired about the action the Police took against those who violated quarantine curfew regulations, noted that a total of 691 persons were arrested for violating quarantine curfew regulations so far, while the number of vehicles taken into police custody is 92. 

 DIG Rohana further reiterated that vehicles passing through areas that have been subjected to quarantine curfew are not permitted to stop their vehicles, disembark, or pick up persons. So far, 12 such vehicles have been detained and the incidents will be dealt with under the quarantine law in the future.

           Several EPZs and FTZs impacted  
 
 By Sarah Hannan 

 Facing the most aggressive spread of the novel coronavirus in Sri Lanka and with health experts now claiming that the viral load this time around is at the strength of infecting nearly 500 persons per asymptomatic person, the complacency the authorities are displaying has raised many concerns.  

 The latest outbreak that unfolded on 3 October has now one on to infect over 2,500 persons that directly or indirectly came into contact with persons affiliated to the apparel sector, which has raised doubts about whether some protocols were ignored at the hand of the relevant authorities in the rush to contain the situation.  

  The Sunday Morning   , over the past two weeks, received several accounts of mismanagement of persons, not only when they were to be referred to quarantine centres or were required to observe home-quarantine as directed by the public health inspectors, but also when they had been asked to arrive at a public location to provide their nasopharyngeal swab samples for PCR testing to the relevant health authority teams.  

 The Stand Up Movement in Sri Lanka Convenor Ashila Dandeniya has been actively relaying the hardships that the Free Trade Zone (FTZ) and Export Processing Zone (EPZ) employees are undergoing at present through social media platforms.  

 Speaking to    The Sunday Morning   , Dandeniya noted: “The biggest concern that we now have is that some of these groups have run out of dry rations and they have not been given clear instructions as to what they should do next. They are enveloped in uncertainties and we cannot even reach out to them to provide them the necessary psychosocial support or provide them rations.”  

 Recalling the first few days following the first apparel worker being detected as a Covid-19-positive person, Dandeniya claimed that the public was quick to stigmatise the people who have become the lifeblood of the economy.  

 She noted that many that come and work at the FTZs and EPZs are living in hostels that accommodate people from various factories.  

 “Hostels in the EPZs and FTZs house persons from four to five factories, so if one person from one factory gets infected, before long, the virus can spread to the other factories through the first contacts. People who worked for many of the factories had worked during the lockdown period as well, as the Government had named it as an essential service,” Dandeniya elaborated.  

 Sharing one of the testimonies, Dandeniya said that a company had asked one of its employees not to report to work after they had discovered that a hosteller at the Next garment factory was residing at the same accommodation. Many from the Next garment factory have tested positive for Covid-19 now, but the public health inspectors (PHIs) had only asked the persons at the hostel to observe self-quarantine. So far, none of the persons who shared the communal spaces at the hostel with the Covid-19-positive patient or his roommate have been subjected to PCR tests.  

 This group had then gone to the school in Amandoluwa providing nasopharyngeal swab samples for PCR testing, since they were requested to turn up if they were close contacts of anyone that was tested positive at the time or worked or lived in the same premises. However, the authorities had only taken samples from the employees who worked at the factory premises and had asked the others to return to their accommodation.  

 “On 17 October they did PCR tests and by 19 October the report of one of those children turned out to be positive for Covid-19. So, in the evening, a group including the area PHI came and took the person who tested positive away. On their way out, they put up a poster on our gate indicating that the persons in the premises were asked to self-quarantine. The other person who was in the same room with the person who tested positive is still in the hostel,” Dandeniya noted.  

 She noted that one of the hostellers had reported that no one was sent to even disinfect the premises. “They all use the same well and the same toilets. Who can they tell about these issues? On the one hand, they are afraid for their own lives and think that they might be carrying the virus by now and on the other hand, they had no way to go out and were running out of rations.”  

 Govt. steps in Buses deployed to Brandix Minuwangoda to transport staff to Quarantine Centres, 07 October 2020

 Dandeniya also said that they were quite disappointed about the way the employers were not proactively assisting the Government's efforts in sending people to quarantine centres or asking them to observe home-quarantine, looking after the wellbeing of the employees who are stuck in isolated zones, or even providing the necessary assistance in conducting sample collection for PCR testing.  

 “If each factory owner had arranged for their respective employees to undergo the necessary health screening and facilitate the nasopharyngeal swab sample submission to the health authorities at their factories itself, the whole calamity that happened at the Amandoluwa school could have been avoided. That was the least they could have done for the sake of their employees, who were forced to report to work even when they were experiencing flu-like symptoms.”  

 Meanwhile, last week, with the entire Gampaha District being placed under quarantine curfew, the Government had finally arranged the distribution of dry ration packs, a Rs. 5,000 relief allowance, and a nutrition pack for schoolchildren within the District.  

 Factory lacked safety measures    

 About 100-200 workers who contracted the flu in early September went to the factory's sick room and complained about it, where they were told that this was a normal virus. When those workers asked for sick leave, the management refused to grant them leave and ordered them to report to work.  

 In a joint comment made by Brandix factory workers, they said: “We have a question as to why the PHIs have not been notified despite so many cases of viral flu being reported. We suspect that the administration may have ignored this due to a shipment emergency. Many of us presumed that the workers were falling ill due to exhaustion of being overworked.”  

 One of the things that were talked about among the workers who came for the PCR test on Monday (12) was that they were turning off their phones because some workers were asking officials why they had not taken appropriate action.  

 Workers said that although some limited measures had been taken to prevent the spread of the virus after the lockdown, almost everything was now relaxed and disinfectant or hand washing facilities were negligible.  Brandix responds  

A spokesperson for Brandix speaking to  The Sunday Morning   Business  section  had explained that the company has put in place health and safety protocols based on the regulatory authorities of Sri Lanka, including the protocol for the prevention and control of Covid-19 across all their facilities. They explained that the disease is new and evolving, and that they are still learning about the efficacy of their processes.

Brandix is to conduct their independent investigation to understand whether there were any lapses on the company's part that took place at their  Minuwangoda plant in following the standards mentioned, and also the new controls that would be needed to augment our current processes to ensure the prevention and control of Covid-19.

The company is currently working with the regulatory authorities of Sri Lanka to implement the new recommendations to facilitate a sustainable operating model for the apparel industry in a Covid-19- prevalent environment. Adoption of continuous random PCR testing at all their plants, the recommended hostel operating model for their associates, and the additional controls in the recruitment process which includes comprehensive screening and PCR testing are some of  the new practices they currently working towards implementing. 
 Factories adopt additional precautions    

 Following the recent Covid-19 outbreak which has hampered not only the apparel sector but even other companies functioning within the EPZs and FTZs situated in the Gampaha and Colombo Districts, the Joint Apparel Association Forum Sri Lanka (JAAFSL) agreed to adopt several extra precautionary guidelines.  

 JAAFSL Secretary General Tuli Cooray, speaking to    The Sunday Morning   , said: “The entire world is still learning about the nature of this disease and it is unfair to stigmatise or blame anyone at this point. We are always looking out for the wellbeing of our employees and are constantly subjected to compliance checks. Therefore, within the workplace, we always follow the best practices.”  

JAAFSL Secretary General Tuli Cooray

 The JAAFSL, following a discussion they had with the health services authorities, agreed to adopt several extra precautions from now on.  

 “There are some steps that are not in our control, such as instructing accommodation providers to only house workers from one factory. That is something we will have to consider in the long term. Other than that, most of the other suggestions can be set in motion with immediate effect.”  

 Elaborating on the measures that are now in place, Cooray added that factories have now been instructed to do temperature checks three times within a shift. In addition, if any worker shows symptoms of a cold or has a high temperature, they are to be referred for medical attention and are to be isolated until they are moved to a health facility. With concerns of continuing operations and not hindering their production work, the Government had also instructed that the factory workers be given transport to and from the workplace.  

 “Many of our members do utilise factory-provided transport facilities for their employees, so this is not an issue or a new practice that they have to adapt to. But with the quarantine curfew that is in place in certain areas, we have now informed workers who are required to travel to work from those areas that they are not required to report to work; that way, we can assist the Government in its attempts to prevent the spread of this virus,” Cooray noted further.  

 While it would affect their output at this moment, Cooray explained that it is better to assist the Government in their efforts to reduce the amount of people getting unnecessarily exposed to the virus by requesting people not to take a risk and travel through such areas.  

 When asked about the requirement that the BOI had suggested to get 5% of the workforce to be randomly tested on a weekly basis through named private hospitals, Cooray explained that it is impractical given that their testing capacities would not be able to handle such a large batch of samples, be it private or state hospitals.  

 “However, if the health authorities would make the rapid antigen test facility available which is able to determine whether a person is carrying the virus or not, then whoever is infected can undergo the PCR test; that would help reduce the work required to obtain nasopharyngeal swab samples for testing,” Cooray opined.  

 The JAAFSL vowed that they are willing to co-operate with the healthcare authorities and the Government in containing this virus and at the same time ensured that none of their workforce is forced to work under conditions that would risk their health and wellbeing at any moment.  

 Letter sent to Minister of Labour    

 A letter has been sent to Minister of Labour Nimal Siripala de Silva highlighting the issues faced by employees at the trade zones: PCR testing is conducted on trade zone workers in Katunayake, Biyagama, and Koggala, who are then taken to quarantine centres.  

 Following the discussion of the Tripartite Task Force Committee on 12 October 2020 on the steps to be taken regarding the infected, to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in the Katunayake FTZ area and other industrial areas, the collective suggested that the following steps be implemented or adopted to protect the Katunayake FTZ as well as other EPZs of the Board of Investment (BOI), such as the Biyagama, Avissawella, Horana, and Wathupitiwala EPZs:  
 
            Pre-preparation of quarantine areas for employees who may be subject to inspection in all EPZs   
            Establishment of health committees comprising employees' representatives in each factory to recommend to the Department of Labour and the BOI, a timely schedule to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic and to make all employees aware of the pandemic   
            Make hostel owners aware of the steps to be taken to disinfect the hostels to prevent the pandemic spread   
            Five PCR machines were randomly assigned to each institution. The Government's decision to investigate is not enough to gauge the current situation, so 10 out of every 100 employees will be randomly assigned to PCR tests in the next two weeks. A decision should be made that employers should take responsibility to test the employees   
            As four factories in the Katunayake FTZ have been temporarily closed due to the identification of infected persons and since most of the staff working in the hostels are located in nearby hostels, the relevant companies must be advised to provide them with the required salaries and other facilities, including food and beverages   
            The manpower agencies that have employees in these factories must work to implement all of the above steps without any changes and a decision must be made that the companies they last worked for should pay and provide the necessary facilities to those employees as well   
            With regard to the employees recruited in these institutions by manpower agencies and other persons, a programme should be implemented to ensure that the required information is maintained properly and the BOI should take full responsibility for it   
            Tripartite committees with representation of public and private parties and trade unions, with direct involvement to inquire into the proper implementation of the above steps and instructions, must be appointed

,,Mission accomplished?,news," After weeks of wild speculation about the fate of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution, the controversial piece of legislation comfortably sailed through the legislature with an overwhelming two-thirds majority giving the incumbent executive near absolute power. 

 The latest amendment to the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka restores almost all of the powers taken away from the executive through the 19th Amendment and vested in independent commissions, which has now been consigned to the dustbin of history.  

 As a result, Sri Lanka once again has an all-powerful Executive as head of government with sweeping powers that includes the right to make key appointments including that of judges to the apex court, the Attorney General, and Inspector General of Police. 

 Even though the Speaker announced that the draft piece of legislation had received the green light from the Supreme Court, subject to certain specified amendments, the main Opposition kept up the pressure to stick to the 19th until such time a new constitution was drafted. As a result, the draft bill underwent not only those amendments specified by the Supreme Court but in total over a hundred others from the originally presented document, before the final version was adopted 156 to 65 late Thursday evening (22). 

 However, despite the overwhelming margin, the Government was forced to double down on its boast of not depending on minority support, as in the end, the two-thirds majority was achieved with the support of seven Opposition minority Members of Parliament. These MPs were in the eye of a storm in their own opposition alliance with the main constituent party the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) leadership gunning for the ouster of the rebellious members including the leaders of the two main Muslim parties who they allege were complicit in the strategic manoeuvre to support the 20th Amendment. On Friday (23), the SJB took a decision to sack the SJB MPs who had gone against the party’s stand on the 20th Amendment, For all intents and purposes, had the eight members of the SJB not voted “yes”, the Government could have only mustered 148 votes and the 20th Amendment would not have seen the light of day. 

 The status quo has opened new vistas for both the Government as well as the Opposition. The 20th Amendment has helped polarise power in a manner not seen in decades, with the Government becoming all powerful and the Opposition rendered even more helpless with the loss of support of eight of its members. The fact that the power equilibrium has shifted so dramatically in less than three months since the last general election will no doubt be food for thought for the drafters of the new constitution. 

 The successful enactment of the 20th Amendment completes an unprecedented 11 months in which the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) has acquired and consolidated its power, first by comfortably winning the presidential election held last November, then consolidating that with a thumping victory at the general election held last August, and finally, the icing on the cake, by removing the inconvenient 19th Amendment with a two-thirds majority. The combined effect of all this puts the party in an unassailable position, the likes of which was last seen in 1978 when the current Constitution was introduced by the then J.R. Jayewardene-led United National Party (UNP) Government. The irony of it all is that when that Constitution is finally replaced, there will not be a single member of the UNP in Parliament if it continues to leave vacant its solitary seat. 

 Going by what has transpired so far, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa seems to have the Midas touch and everything he has touched has turned to gold. But with power comes responsibility and with absolute power comes absolute responsibility. It is also pertinent to keep in mind that power is nothing without control. The next four years will no doubt show how the President chooses to exercise the immense power that is now at his disposal in order to work for the betterment of the country and its people who have consistently and overwhelmingly voted to strengthen his hands in the hope of a better tomorrow. 

 Interestingly enough, just hours after the 20th Amendment was passed in Parliament, no less a person than the subject minister responsible for pushing through the legislation, Justice Minister Ali Sabry, posted a message on social media that the time has come to deliver what was promised to the people and there was no longer any room for complacency, as all power was now vested with the Government. It is unclear as to what motivated him to post the message but what is clear is that at least one Minister is aware of the burden of power and the resultant pressure that has been brought upon the Government to deliver. 

 With the evolving Covid-related crisis situation, the road ahead is not going to be an easy one. The growth agenda for the entire tenure of the Government will be defined by the way it handles the current crisis which could pose a huge challenge if and when community spread was to take place. Therefore, it is important that the authorities continue to stay on top of the game and mitigate the risks for the country.   

 In addition to the overabundance of domestic issues, the Government now has to deal with multiple headaches on the international front with an imminent visit from the US Secretary of State signalling the intensification of geopolitical power games in the Indian Ocean region with Sri Lanka at the centre of it. In addition, the Government will have to handle the purported de-proscription of the LTTE by a court in the UK which, if not tackled tactfully, is bound to have repercussions in other parts of the world, mainly in Europe.  

 The other big headache is the downgrading of the country’s international credit rating to near junk status which will increase the cost of funds to prohibitively high levels, further impacting the macroeconomic outlook. 

 On the flip side, the passage of the 20th Amendment has caused similar headaches for the main Opposition SJB which in less than three months in Parliament has seen its first group of rebel MPs go against the party. The party’s reaction to the affront will now define not only its leadership but more importantly its credibility as a potential governing alternative in the eyes of its supporters. After all, the rationale for its acrimonious breakup with the UNP was the allegation of the party engaging in “deal politics”. All too soon, the very same reality has hit home but the party has taken a strong stance in trying to nip the cancer in the bud, lest it meet the same fate as the UNP. 

 As much as the rebellion is a challenge for the young party, it is also an opportunity to establish itself as a disciplined, dependable political alternative. It is commendable that Sajith Premadasa has taken the opportunity to prove himself a decisive leader by purging the rebels. Therefore, the fate of the party, and indeed that of the collective Opposition, is very much in his hands and these tough decisions he makes will potentially define his legacy as a leader. 

 The 20th Amendment has brought with it not only power to the presidency but also challenges and opportunities for both the Government as well as the Opposition. For the Government, it is now a matter of delivery while for the Opposition, it is all about redemption. For both parties, the mission is only just beginning.

           SJB sacks errant MPs; Hakeem and Bathiudeen told to act  
           Stage set for Pompeo’s visit with advance team arriving on Friday  
 
 The much talked of 20th Amendment to the Constitution last week received parliamentary approval with 150-plus votes after creating much controversy within the governing Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) as well as the Opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) in the run up to last Thursday (22) night’s vote on the legislation. 

The aftermath of the 20th Amendment has created chaos in the SJB and disunity among the members over eight errant MPs who supported the 20  th   Amendment despite an official SJB decision of not supporting the legislation. 

 After weeks of political discussions and arguments, the 20th Amendment to the Constitution was passed in Parliament last Thursday with 156 votes in favour and 65 against the piece of legislation. 

 The voting got underway at around 7.40 p.m., concluding a two-day debate that commenced on Wednesday (21). 

 Several Opposition parliamentarians representing the SJB voted in favour of the 20th Amendment. Among the Opposition MPs who voted in support of it were Diana Gamage, Ishak Rahuman, Faizal Cassim, H.M.M. Harees, M.S. Thowfeek, A. Aravind Kumar, A.S.M. Raheem, and Nazeer Ahamad. 

 While members of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) and All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC), which are the main coalition partners of the SJB, voted in favour of the 20th Amendment, SLMC Leader MP Rauff Hakeem and ACMC Leader MP Rishad Bathiudeen voted against the legislation. 

 The irony of the role played by the Muslim MPs in supporting the Government was not lost on the public, given the comments and memes that did the rounds on social media, reminding people of the anti-Muslim sentiments propagated by hard-line Sinhala-Buddhist factions in the SLPP.During the third reading of the 20th Amendment Bill, Minister of Justice Ali Sabry introduced several amendments to the clauses in the newly passed legislation. 

 However, Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella called for a vote on Clause 17 of the legislation, which enables dual citizens to hold public office. The clause was passed with 157 votes while 64 cast their votes against it. 

 It was interesting to note that ACMC MP S.M. Musharraf who voted against the second and third readings of the 20th Amendment voted in favour of Clause 17 when a vote was taken on it. 

 All governing party MPs, sans former President MP Maithripala Sirisena, voted in favour of the 20th Amendment. 

 Sirisena’s letter 

 Sirisena was not present in the Parliament Chamber when the 20th Amendment was taken for a vote on Thursday evening. His absence was noticeable and everyone started to wonder why he was not present during the vote. 

 Some of the governing party members noted that Sirisena was occupied since he was summoned before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) probing Easter Sunday attacks that evening. 

 However, it is learnt that the PCoI, which had allocated between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. for Sirisena’s cross examining last Thursday, had limited its session for one hour and concluded hearings at 5.15 p.m. 

 Nevertheless, Sirisena refrained from attending parliament sessions. 

 It is learnt that Sirisena had in fact sent a letter to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa explaining his inability to vote in favour of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution. 

 He had observed that since he was instrumental in introducing the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, he could not vote consciously in favour of the 20th Amendment. 

 He had further explained that the 19th Amendment was initiated by him with great faith that he could strengthen the democratic institutions in the country and take the country on a progressive path. 

 However, he had said that the actions of then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had obstructed the proper implementation of the 19th Amendment, preventing the country and its people from experiencing the true benefits of the legislation. 

 He had also said he hoped both the President and the Prime Minister would understand his position and not be affronted by it. 

 However, neither the President nor the Prime Minister had responded to Sirisena’s letter. 

 Reaching agreement 

 The run up to the vote on the 20th Amendment saw the governing party heading towards an internal crisis over the clause enabling dual citizens to hold public office in the 20th Amendment, with nationalist forces and political parties within the SLPP carrying out a continuous agitation against what they termed as a “contentious clause” in the legislation. 

 The nationalist parties in the Government represented in Parliament threatened to carry out their objections during the vote on the piece of legislation. 

 Several discussions held on the matter with the Prime Minister failed to bring the anticipated results to these nationalist forces including several leading Buddhist monks. Finally, it was the President who had to intervene to build unity in the governing party and ensure that all SLPP MPs in the House voted in favour of the 20th Amendment. 

National Freedom Front on 22 October announced that they will not support Clause 17

 The President on Wednesday (21), the day prior to the vote on the 20th Amendment, had met with Ministers Wimal Weerawansa, Vasudeva Nanayakkara, and Udaya Gammanpila as well as MPs Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Weerasumana Weerasinghe, Asanka Navaratne, and Tiran Alles. 

 The meeting had been convened by Alles and the discussion was focused completely on the dual citizens’ clause. 

 The President had given a keen ear to the concerns raised by the group of MPs who have been objecting to the dual citizens’ clause since the drafting of the 20th Amendment. 

 After listening to the MPs, the President had reasoned out that there was a need for the 20th Amendment to be passed in Parliament and to ensure the unity of the Government. While he had said that the 20th Amendment needs to be passed in Parliament the following day, he also assured that the request of the Buddhist clergy and parliamentarians would be addressed when the new constitution is introduced within next year. 

 Nanayakkara had been pleased with the President’s explanation, but Weerawansa had continued to push for the removal of the clause. 

 However, after the meeting with the President, the pro-nationalist forces had met and discussed the President’s assurance. 

 It was finally agreed that all parties would agree to the 20th Amendment at present and ensure that the dual citizens’ clause would be dropped from the new constitution that is currently in the making. 

 Weerawansa, Nanayakkara, Gammanpila, and Weerasumana convened a news conference on Thursday at the Parliamentary Complex. 

 During the news conference, the MPs explained that they will support the 20th Amendment following the assurance given by the President. 

 Amending the amendment 

 Earlier last week, the Cabinet of Ministers reached an agreement on introducing several amendments to the 20th Amendment. 

 On Monday (19) evening, the SLPP parliamentary group met at around 6.30 p.m. at the Presidential Secretariat under the patronage of President Rajapaksa. 

 Once again, concerns over the 20th Amendment Bill were taken up for discussion. 

 However, the Government at the meeting had decided to introduce several amendments to the proposed 20th Amendment Bill that was before Parliament. 

 The announcement was made by Minister of Justice Sabry on Monday evening during the group meeting. At the outset of the meeting, the Prime Minister had asked Sabry to explain to the group the amendments that had been discussed for the 20th Amendment. 

 It was announced that the amendments to the proposed new piece of legislation relate to the powers vested with the president to dissolve Parliament, the number of ministers in the Cabinet, auditing of state institutions, and the presentation of emergency bills. 

 The Government has decided to increase the number of years Parliament has to function before the president could dissolve the legislature to two-and-a-half years and for the cabinet to be limited to 30 members. 

 Also, the auditing of state institutions is to be carried out in the same manner as previously stipulated in the 19th Amendment. 

 The other amendment is to limit the submission of emergency bills to times of disasters and in the event of a threat to national security. 

 However, no decision was reached to amend the clause on dual citizens holding public office under the 20th Amendment, which has gathered much opposition by several coalition partners of the Government. 

 The following day (20), Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena announced to Parliament the observations of the Supreme Court (SC) on the petitions that were filed against the proposed 20th Amendment Bill. 

 Once the SC observations were announced, the governing party announced its decision to introduce other amendments to the Bill at the committee stage of the debate in Parliament. 

 Party leaders meet MR 

 The day before the SLPP group met under the patronage of President Rajapaksa, SLPP party leaders on Sunday (18) met with Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa to discuss the 20th Amendment Bill that was to be taken up in Parliament on Wednesday (21) and Thursday (22). 

 The meeting with the Prime Minister was decided due to the concerns over the new piece of legislation continuously expressed by governing party leaders that had intensified following a meeting held earlier in the month at Temple Trees on the subject under the patronage of President Rajapaksa. 

 The meeting last Sunday was scheduled to be held at the Presidential Secretariat, but the venue was later changed to Rajapaksa’s official residence at Wijerama Mawatha in Colombo 7. 

 Neither the President nor Justice Minister Sabry were present at the meeting held at Wijerama Mawatha. 

 During the meeting chaired by the Prime Minister, many aspects of the 20th Amendment Bill had been discussed once again. 

 Muslim MPs to support 

 Rajapaksa had informed the gathering that the Muslim parties in Parliament – the SLMC and the ACMC – were likely to cast their votes in favour of the 20th Amendment when it is taken up for a vote in the House. 

 National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Minister Weerawansa had questioned the difficulties the governing party members would face before the public in such a scenario, given the statements made public by them about the two Muslim political parties and its members. 

 “Given what had been said during the past few years, how will we face the public?” Weerawansa had questioned. 

 Rajapaksa had responded saying the two party leaders – Hakeem and Bathiudeen – were unlikely to vote in favour of the 20th Amendment. 

 “Anyway, what can we do if the Muslim MPs were to forcibly vote in favour of the amendment?” the Prime Minister had questioned in a lighter vein. 

 Minister Nanayakkara had sternly objected to the clause in the proposed piece of legislation that enables dual citizens to hold public office. He had said that it was difficult for some of the governing party members in Parliament to consciously vote in favour of the 20th Amendment Bill if the clause on dual citizens was not amended. 

 Meanwhile, speaking on behalf of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), party General Secretary State Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara had said his party could not agree with the clause in the proposed amendment that prevented the auditing of accounts of over 100 state institutions. 

 Jayasekara had further expressed disappointment in the failure on the part of either the Justice Minister or any other member who had drafted the new piece of legislation to respond to the recommendations submitted by the SLFP to be included in the 20th Amendment. 

 While many party leaders had expressed concerns about some of the contents in the 20th Amendment, the Prime Minister had concluded the meeting saying he would discuss their concerns with the President and the Minister of Justice. 

 When leaving the Wijerama Mawatha meeting, party leaders, making comments to the media, said that matters related to the 20th Amendment were discussed at the meeting, but refrained from giving further details. 

 Monks agitate 

 The day after the party leaders’ meeting, Abhayarama Temple Chief Incumbent Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera called a meeting on Monday (19) at the temple with several governing party parliamentarians from the pro-nationalist camp. 

 The meeting was convened at 11 a.m. on Monday in the backdrop of the Prime Minister informing party leaders of the governing party on Sunday evening that the Muslim political parties in Parliament were going to vote in favour of the 20th Amendment Bill. 

 Ven. Ananda Thera had also invited Prime Minister Rajapaksa for the meeting. 

 The meeting was attended by Ministers Dinesh Gunawardena, Weerawansa, Nanayakkara, Gamini Lokuge, Gammanpila, Bandula Gunawardana, and Vidura Wickremanayake, as well as MPs Gevindu Kumaranatunge and Alles. 

 Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera, Ven. Bengamuwe Nalaka Thera, Ven. Medagoda Abhayatissa Thera, and several other leading members of the Buddhist clergy have also participated in the meeting. 

 It is learnt that one of the ministers had pointed out at the meeting that the President was agreeable to amend the clauses in the proposed piece of legislation related to dual citizens and the auditing of state institutions. However, the Minister had noted that SLPP theoretician/Founder Basil Rajapaksa was opposed to amending the said clauses in the amendment. 

 Another minister had said that the Justice Minister had told him that he was not agreeable to all the clauses in the 20th Amendment Bill, although he had presented it to Parliament. The Justice Minister had said that Basil had wanted the contentious clauses to be included in the 20th Amendment. 

 It is also learnt that it had transpired during the meeting that the President, during a telephone conversation with a leading Buddhist monk in the country, had said he was prepared to withdraw the 20th Amendment if there was such vehement protest against it. 

 Finally, Ven. Ananda Thera had reiterated that the Government should not proceed with the 20th Amendment. 

 The Thera had further noted that it was the final warning the monks were going to make over the piece of legislation. 

 He had added that if the Government proceeds with the 20th Amendment without heeding the requests of the Buddhist monks, steps would be taken to surround Parliament as well as to hold islandwide protests against the legislation. 

 It is also learnt that Ven. Ananda Thera had invited the governing party members to a lunch after the meeting concluded. 

 Warnings    

 Three leading monks publicly warned that the 20th Amendment led to the creation of a President who would be able to control the executive in an arbitrary manner and bring the judiciary and legislature under his control. 

 The letter followed the opposition raised by the Amarapura-Ramanna Samagri Maha Sangha Sabha to the 20th Amendment, citing it will pave the way for an “undeveloped tribal society”. 

 Ven. Nalaka Thera, Ven. Ananda Thera, and Ven. Gunawansa Thera, in a letter to the President, noted that the 20th Amendment would lead to the formation of a weak cabinet and also weaken the power and stability of Prime Minister Rajapaksa, who has won the hearts of the people. 

 The Thero added that it would also allow the President to change ministers and their powers as and when he pleases. 

 The letter noted that there could be an ulterior motive with regard to lifting the restriction on the number of cabinet ministers, which is limited to 30 members. 

 According to the Thero, multiple responsibilities vested with the Prime Minister have been removed in the 20th Amendment, and they have highlighted the fact that the people have been deprived of the right to challenge in court any unconstitutional act committed by the person who holds the post of president. 

 They had also warned that the 20th Amendment could pave the way for the creation of an unstable governance mechanism that would have no rule of law. 

 Hela Bodu Saviya Chief Patron Ven. Omalpe Sobitha Thera also sent a letter to President Rajapaksa regarding his concerns over the 20th Amendment last Monday. 

 Although the 20th Amendment which was gazetted and published was to be debated in Parliament, Ven. Sobitha Thera had stated that the clergy, who are dedicated to the Sasana and social service of the country in various ways, have already expressed their displeasure. 

 The letter had also stated that the 20th Amendment would place the country’s democracy in a questionable position, as well as make the Government highly unpopular within the civil community. Ven. Sobitha Thera requested the President to use the trust placed in him wisely and take the public’s concerns over the 20th Amendment into consideration. 

 SLFP urged to reconsider 

 Chaos over the 20th Amendment continued when a group of leading Buddhist monks on Wednesday (21) requested the main coalition partner of the Government, the SLFP, to consider the dangers of the dual citizenship clause in the 20th Amendment Bill. 

 Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera, along with Ven. Bengamuwe Nalaka Thera and Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera, participated in the meeting with a group of senior SLFP parliamentarians. 

 During the discussion, the Thero had discussed the content of the 20th Amendment Bill and commended the Government’s decision to amend three vital clauses in the legislation. 

 However, they had noted that all the contentious issues in the 20th Amendment Bill were not addressed since the Government intends to continue with the clause that enables dual citizens to hold public office under the proposed piece of legislation. 

 Ven. Ananda Thera had explained to the SLFP that the dual citizenship clause was a danger to the country and should not be passed in Parliament. 

 The SLFP was asked to consider the dangers before supporting the 20th Amendment Bill. 

 The SLFP delegation included party Ministers Dayasiri Jayasekara, Duminda Dissanayake, Nimal Siripala de Silva, Mahinda Amaraweera, Jagath Pushpakumara, Weerakumara Dissanayake, and Lasantha Alagiyawanna. 

 After taking into consideration all aspects of the 20th Amendment and the assurances given by the President to address all concerns in the proposed new constitution, the SLFP MPs decided to vote in favour of the legislation. 

 SJB crises 

 The crisis – or more likely, the crises – in the SJB started to get worse towards the weekend with many young SJB MPs calling for stern action by the party leadership against the errant MPs who had violated the party decision. 

Samagi Jana Balawegaya donned slogan facemasks and arm bands in protest over 20A

 SJB Leader and Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa and General Secretary MP Ranjith Madduma Bandara were put under pressure to act against the leaders of the SLMC and ACMC since they had allowed the MPs representing their respective political parties to act in contravention to the SJB stand. 

 A group of SJB MPs on Friday (23) signed and handed over a letter to Madduma Bandara seeking action against the errant MPs. 

 The letter, signed by 22 SJB MPs, called on Madduma Bandara to keep to the statement made by him on Thursday that any individual who goes against the party decision and votes in favour of the 20th Amendment will be sacked from the party. 

 The letter also noted that while the leaders of the SLMC and the ACMC, Hakeem and Bathiudeen, had stood by the official SJB decision on the 20th Amendment, members of their parties had violated the collective decision made on the said piece of legislation. 

 Therefore, the SJB MPs called on the SJB General Secretary to request Hakeem and Bathiudeen to expel the MPs who had violated the party decision. 

 The group of MPs had further noted that if Hakeem and Bathiudeen fail to act against their party members, they too should be sacked from the SJB. 

 That evening, SJB MP Harsha de Silva announced that the party had taken a decision to sack the members who voted against the party stand on the 20th Amendment. 

 After a meeting held on Friday evening, the party took an unanimous decision to expel the group of MPs from the party’s parliamentary group with further disciplinary action to be taken later. 

 Meanwhile, on Friday (23), Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) Leader and SJB MP Mano Ganesan, through his Twitter account, stated that he had suspended MP Aravinda Kumar who had supported the 20th Amendment on Thursday. 

 “I hereby suspend Aravindakumar MP from Tamil Progressive Alliance. He will be sacked from #TPA by the Politburo. The TPA parliamentary group will discuss this matter in a few hours. His party, Upcountry People’s Front, will be asked to take further action against him,” Ganesan tweeted. 

 SJB legitimacy issues 

 However, the SJB’s attempts to take legal action against MP Gamage has stirred a hornet’s nest since both Gamage and her husband, Senaka de Silva, hold the power of the party. 

 In an interview with    The Sunday Morning   , Gamage confirmed that it was she and her husband who have legal control over the party. 

 In the run up to this year’s general election, Premadasa and his supporters took over the Ape Jathika Peramuna party formed by De Silva and Gamage and converted it to the SJB with Premadasa as the Leader and Madduma Bandara as the General Secretary. 

 De Silva was appointed as the Deputy Leader of the SJB while Gamage was named the Deputy General Secretary. 

 However, it is learnt that the SJB’s Constitution, which is also the Constitution of Ape Jathika Peramuna, has several bylaws that would prevent either Premadasa or Madduma Bandara from taking any stern disciplinary action against Gamage akin to their removal from the National List slot. 

 In fact, it is learnt that a majority of the Central Committee of the SJB are from the committee that was formed by De Silva and Gamage when registering the Ape Jathika Peramuna at the Election Commission. 

 Therefore, both De Silva and Gamage wield power over the SJB, as they hold majority powers in the SJB Central Committee. 

 Gamage, therefore, has adopted a “you try your best and see” attitude with regard to any moves by Premadasa or Madduma Bandara to initiate disciplinary action against her and sack her from Parliament. 

 SLPP-SLFP iron out issues 

 While the SJB is trying to resolve its internal crises, the SLPP and SLFP are working at consolidating its political alliance. 

 The district leaders of the SLPP and SLFP met on Tuesday (20) to iron out issues faced by the respective party representatives in the constituencies. 

 The meeting was focused on discussing the grievances of the members of both parties at the district level, along with solutions. 

 SLFP General Secretary Jayasekara said the two parties had discussed how the SLPP and the SLFP could work together in the local government bodies. 

 “We discussed how the two parties together could gain control of local government bodies and function as an alliance,” he said. 

 According to Jayasekara, the district representatives of both parties have been asked to hold joint meetings in their respective constituencies and formulate a working mechanism that would be presented at the next meeting in Colombo. 

 The SLPP group was led by several party seniors including party General Secretary MP Sagara Kariyawasam, Minister of Tourism Prasanna Ranatunga, and Minister of Ports and Shipping Rohitha Abeygunawardena. 

 The SLFP group was led by party General Secretary Jayasekara; National Organiser and State Minister of Solar Power, Wind, and Hydropower Generation Projects Development Duminda Dissanayake; and State Minister of Co-operative Services, Marketing Development, and Consumer Protection Alagiyawanna. 

 All set for Pompeo 

 While the local political stage continues to be a hive of activity, the Government this week is gearing for the official visit of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Sri Lanka. 

 Pompeo, it is learnt, is scheduled to arrive in the country on Tuesday (27) and leave the following day (28). 

 Further confirming Pompeo’s arrival in the country, a group of senior US military officers had reportedly arrived in Sri Lanka on Wednesday (21) to make the necessary security arrangements and preparations for Pompeo’s visit. 

 It is learnt that an advance team of around 16 US military personnel had arrived in a Qatar Airways flight from Doha, Qatar. 

 The personnel had reportedly been quarantined for a day and been subjected to PCR tests. 

 Meanwhile, the US last Thursday had urged Sri Lanka to make “difficult but necessary” decisions to secure its economic independence for long-term prosperity. 

 Ahead of Pompeo's visit to Colombo, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asia Dean Thompson had told reporters that the US wants to partner with Sri Lanka on their shared goals of sustainable economic development and a free and open Indo-Pacific. 

 The Indo-Pacific is a biogeographic region comprising the Indian Ocean and the western and central Pacific Ocean, including the South China Sea. China claims nearly all of the South China Sea, though Taiwan, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, and Vietnam claim parts of it. 

 “In the interest of strengthening our longstanding partnership with Sri Lanka and reinforcing our long-term commitment to the region, we encourage Sri Lanka to review the options we offer for transparent and sustainable economic development in contrast to discriminatory and opaque practices,” Thompson had been quoted as saying in foreign media in a veiled reference to China. 

 “We urge Sri Lanka to make difficult but necessary decisions to secure its economic independence for long-term prosperity, and we stand ready to partner with Sri Lanka for its economic development and growth,” he had said. 

 Pompeo is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and Minister of Foreign Affairs Dinesh Gunawardena to emphasise the US’ commitment to a strong, independent, and democratic Sri Lanka, Thompson had noted. 

 “We’ll continue to urge Sri Lanka to advance democratic governance, human rights, reconciliation, religious freedom, and justice which promote the country’s long-term stability and prosperity and ensure the dignity and equality of all Sri Lanka’s diverse communities,” Thompson had further noted. 

 Responding to a question posed to him, the US official had said the US watches closely the developments in Sri Lanka on issues related to human rights. 

 The Secretary will, of course, be raising issues related to human rights, reconciliation, and the US’ common commitment to democracy, he had said. 

 “Our partnership with Sri Lanka goes back a long way, through a lot of different eras, and right now, we think they’re at a point to make some choices about where they head,” he had said. 

 “During the meetings, the Secretary of State will also be discussing the issues related to China,” Thompson had added in response to another question. 

 TNA and Modi 

 The Tamil National Alliance (TNA), meanwhile, is looking at holding a virtual discussion with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 

 News reports last week quoted TNA Leader R. Sampanthan as stating that a request has been made from India for a meeting with Prime Minister Modi. 

 Sampanthan had stated that the Indian Premier had directed relevant authorities to make the necessary arrangements for the event. 

 Last month saw Modi engage in a virtual discussion with Prime Minister Rajapaksa where several key issues were taken up for discussion. 

 During the discussion, the Indian Prime Minister had called for the full implementation of the 13th Amendment. 

 It is in this backdrop, Tamil Nadu’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Vice President Attorney-at-Law Vanathi Srinivasan had said that India is keeping a close watch on the Chinese activities taking place in Sri Lanka and the pro-Chinese activities of the Sri Lankan Government. 

 She had made these observations during an interview with the    Virakesari    Tamil weekly newspaper. 

 Srinivasan had noted that the arrival of a high-level Chinese delegation to Sri Lanka following discussions between the Prime Ministers of India and Sri Lanka confirms that the Rajapaksa Government is beginning to work closely with China. 

 She had further stated that China was violating the North Indian border and was working closely with Sri Lanka. 

 The BJP representative had noted that there is a high possibility that the intense pressure from the Indian Central Government on the Indo-Lanka Accord and the settlement of ethnic issues would further push Sri Lanka towards a pro-Chinese stance. 

 She had added that the Indian Government should focus on China’s investment in the South of Sri Lanka, and the role of Tamil representatives in the Sri Lankan Government.

,,Need a person like Basil in Parliament: S.M.M. Muszhaaraff,interviews," By Sarah Hannan 

 The much-disputed Clause 17 of the 20th Amendment (20A) on dual citizenship was put to vote separately, during which Opposition parliamentarian S.M.M. Muszhaaraff, who voted against the second and third readings of the new constitutional amendment, voted in favour of the clause. 

  The Sunday Morning  spoke to Muszhaaraff of the All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC), which is a constituent partner of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), on his decision to vote in favour of Clause 17 which enabled dual citizenship holders to hold public office and enter Parliament. 

  Following are excerpts of the interview:  

 You voted against the 20A after the second and third readings, but voted in favour of Clause 17 on dual citizens. What made you do that? 

 Our party had arrived at an understanding that we will vote against the 20A, which is why I casted my vote against it. However, Clause 17 in relation to a dual citizenship holder being permitted to be elected to Parliament was taken up as a separate matter, for which I individually voted in favour. 

 My honest opinion is that this will pave the way for Basil Rajapaksa to enter Parliament, and at this juncture, we need a person like him who always takes decisions not based on ethnicity or race, but rather who thinks about the country as a whole. 

 During his political career, he assisted us to launch so many development programmes due to which people – regardless of race, ethnicity, or political party – benefited in the post-war years. 

 Did your party not reach an official decision to vote against the 20A? 

 As you know, our Party Leader Rishad Bathiudeen was taken into custody during a crucial time, yet when he was allowed to attend Parliament on Thursday (22), we were able to have a final round of discussions and decided on how we would exercise our vote. It was agreed that we would all vote against the 20A. 

 The SJB, of which the ACMC is a coalition partner, officially decided to oppose the 20A. Did the ACMC not subscribe to this stand? 

 The common agreement was to vote against the 20A, but when the time came to cast the individual votes, we witnessed that some had gone against the common agreement, which was quite unfortunate. 

 Your Party Leader voted against the 20A including Clause 17. Did you inform the party leadership of your decision to support Clause 17? 

 We agreed that we would oppose the 20A; like I said earlier, Clause 17 was a completely different matter, which is why I decided to vote in favour of it. However, there were some who supported the Government with the passing of the 20A in its entirety, and there were members from the Government who opposed Clause 17. 

 Just because I sit with the Opposition does not mean I have to oppose every move the Government makes. 

 Will there be any disciplinary action against the party members who voted in favour of the 20A? 

 The alliance party Samagi Jana Balawegaya has commented as such. Should it come to that, and if our Party Leader decides to take disciplinary action against those who voted in favour of the 20A as a whole, we will discuss it at that point. 

 At the moment, no such discussion has been taken for the ACMC or the SJB. 

 The ACMC and Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) had spoken against the Government on many occasions over its Sinhala nationalist hard-line stance. Why do you think there was a change of heart among the Muslim MPs in Parliament over the 20A? 

 We are yet to find out what made them vote in favour of the 20A. But political differences and opinions aside, I believe that whether we are on the Government side or in the Opposition side, we have a responsibility towards the citizens of this country to work towards a common goal in developing and taking the country to a prosperous position. 

 Given the current economic turmoil caused by the Covid-19 pandemic both locally and globally, we have to join hands with the Government to find solutions to ensure the wellbeing of the citizens of Sri Lanka. 

 The financial stability of not only Sri Lanka but even the entire world is handicapped with the limitations that are imposed by the global health emergency. We cannot be dwelling in the past and festering age-old wounds that were caused by events that mushroomed racial and ethnic disputes and unrest. 

 We need a clear vision to go ahead and change the future outlook of Sri Lanka as a united force. 

 How will the ACMC and SJB continue with its political alliance in the future? 

 There are certain differences of opinion among the parties that joined forces to form the SJB. However, I am not the best person to answer that question at the moment. God willing, our Leader will be freed from his allegations in the weeks to come and he himself will be able to give you the answer to that question. 

 As for now, we are very much part of the SJB and we will honour the alliance that we made and the party that elected us to Parliament to serve the people of Sri Lanka.

           Party already knew my decision to support 20A; no surprises      
           Ready to face disciplinary action; there's a process to be followed  
 
 By Sarah Hannan    

 Last Thursday’s (22) debate over the 20th Amendment Bill, the vote that followed, and the manner in which certain Opposition Members of Parliament (MPs) voted in favour of it, seem to have baffled many. 

  The Sunday Morning    this week spoke to   Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) National List MP Diana Gamage, who voted in favour of the 20th Amendment (20A), on her decision and what she had to say about the feedback that she is now receiving from her party.    

  Following are excerpts of the interview:  

 You voted for the 20A while your party decided to vote against it. Why did you do that?    

 We have experienced the worst of having a placeholder presidency, especially after what transpired over the past years. However, if the president has no power to make certain decisive decisions to safeguard the country, what is the point in appointing a president after spending billions of public funds? I firmly believe that, even as an Opposition MP, the right amount of support needs to be extended towards the ruling party, to govern the country.    

 We are, after all, here to do a public service. So when it comes to taking a decision, it should never be about the party’s best interest but whether it would be in the best interest of the country’s citizens. 

 This is why I voted in favour of the 20A. I believe that President Gotabaya Rajapaksa will not misuse the powers that are vested with him. He was a public servant and a   high-ranking military officer before he became President. Is it not absolutely necessary that he is granted sufficient powers to take decisions over his citizens, given that he is now President?    

 Did you inform the party of your decision to support the 20A prior to the two-day debate or even before the vote on Thursday?    

 (SJB Leader and Opposition Leader) Sajith Premadasa was well aware of my decision. I had communicated my decision to support the 20A, so he should not act surprised.  

 By voting in favour of the 20A, have you not violated the party decision? Are you prepared to face disciplinary action?    

    The votes were called in as individual decisions. I exercised my right for the change that I believed in. If it comes to the party taking disciplinary action, I am ready to face the collective decision. There is a process that has to be followed; let’s see when it comes to that.    

 The SJB has said it will take disciplinary action against you. Since you are a National List MP, the party could remove you. Will you accept if the party decides to remove you from Parliament?    

 They are not in a position to remove me just like that; I am the Deputy Secretary of the party and the   SJB was elected to Parliament because I allowed them to use the political party that my husband and I had established.    

 The party that was transferred to the SJB was originally the Ape Jathika Peramuna that was under you. Do you still hold legitimate power of the SJB?    

 Of course. I have legitimate power over the   SJB; we have very strong by-laws governing the party. That means my husband, who is a Deputy Chair of the SJB, and I, have a say in the legal decisions that need to be made for the SJB.    

 Do you hold the majority power of the SJB? Aren't your party members the majority of the SJB Central Committee?    

 I very much am (   sic   ). 

 Will you continue to support the Government in Parliament?    

 As I mentioned earlier, we have to extend our support to the Government that is elected. That was what the people of Sri Lanka decided and as people’s representatives, we need to honour that decision. Regardless of the party that I represent, I will give my fullest support to the Government in all its ventures.    

 However, I will also make sure that they are kept in check and I would not shy away if they should be critiqued over their shortcomings.  

 Will you be joining the Government?    

 I do not have to necessarily join the Government to serve the people of this country. I am the District Organiser of the SJB for Vavuniya, and I have been given the opportunity to represent the people in Parliament this time; and whether I sit in the Government or the Opposition, what really matters at the end of the day is that I be given the necessary faculties to serve the people and address their issues at the policy level.  

 There are reports that you met with the President before voting on the 20A. Did you meet the President the night before the vote on the 20A Bill? 

 We are close allies, and   yes, we talk frequently to discuss matters on how to improve the lives of the people of this country. I have always made it known that I am in support of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s vision to improve this country.    

 With the 20A now passed, I believe he has the necessary powers to take forward his vision.  

 How do you plan to steer your future political course?    

 I have no reason to leave the party that I founded. Whatever decisions I make in Parliament are always made with a lot of thought towards improving the livelihoods of this country’s people. If this Government or the ruling party fails to deliver on their promises to the people and misuse the powers that have been given to them, then come the next presidential election, they will appoint a different ruling party.    

 Hypothetically speaking, should that be an SJB-led government, then the decision that I made to vote in favour of the 20A, reinforcing the executive power of the President of Sri Lanka, will be enjoyed by the next president who gets elected, which may be Sajith Premadasa.  

 As much as I look up to Gotabaya Rajapaksa to lead this country to greater heights of prosperity, I have no doubt that Sajith Premadasa too should be elected to be President of this country and that he has the same candour to take this country forward.  

 After all, whatever decision we make now is going to reflect on the future of this country.  

 I trust that people see that my decision will in no way hinder my political journey but open up more opportunities to serve the good people of this country.  ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,I have legitimate power over SJB: Diana Gamage,interviews,0,1603584403,0,102383,,

,,20A: SLMC calls for explanations from errant MPs,news,"Following a discussion last evening (23) on four of its MPs who voted in favour of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress has today issued a statement saying the MPs were asked to explain their position.

 Statement from Sri Lanka Muslim Congress: 

Consequent to the Samagi Jana Balavegaya Parliamentary group meeting, the leader of SLMC Rauff Hakeem, summoned its parliamentary group for a meeting at his residence last evening (23), in the presence of Party Secretary Nizam Kariapper.

,,Sometimes I have to pinch myself: Shyam Selvadurai,brunch,"Funny Boy on Netflix  
 Sri Lankan-born Shyam Selvadurai’s first novel, the highly acclaimed    Funny Boy   , was first published in 1994. It won the WH Smith “Books in Canada First Novel Award” and the “Lambda Literary Award” in the US, and has since been translated into other languages and has been adapted into a feature film. 

 Set in Sri Lanka in the ‘70s and ‘80s, the story is a coming-of-age story through the eyes of young protagonist Arjie (portrayed by Arush Nand and Brandon Ingram), set to the background of escalating political tensions between the Tamils and the Sinhalese. 


 The film is directed by Oscar-nominated Deepa Mehta, best known for the element-title trilogy Fire (1996), Earth (1998), and Water (2005). Mehta co-wrote Funny Boy with Shyam, and it was filmed on location in Sri Lanka. The film stars Brandon Ingram, Nimmi Harasgama, Ali Kazmi, Agam Darshi, Seema Biswas, Rehan Mudannayake, and Shivantha Wijesinha. 

 Funny Boy has since been acquired by Ava DuVernay’s ARRAY and is set to have a theatrical release in Canada and selected cities in the US, while it will be distributed internationally via Netflix on 10 December. 

 A highly anticipated adaptation and an important literary masterpiece very close to our hearts,    Funny Boy    is sure to be a hit amongst Sri Lankan audiences. In anticipation of the film’s release at the end of this year, we reached out to Shyam to share with us his thoughts on Funny Boy getting adapted into a movie nearly three decades after its first release to be viewed by thousands of young audiences who have an entirely new perception of life than his imagined protagonist. 
 

 How involved were you in the process of writing the script and the subsequent filming of the movie? 

 The genesis of the movie was my writing the screenplay of Funny Boy. I had seen a number of attempts to adapt the book, but those screenplays, I felt, tried to put too much of the book into the film and also weren't able to balance the violence along with the personal stories. Often, the violence in those screenplays overplayed the personal stories. In the novel, you have Arjie's narrative consciousness that knits together the disparate stories, but in film you don't have that interiority and so one must focus on Arjie's personal story that is contained in the first and last stories. 

 So I decided to try and do the adaptation myself. I was looking for a new writing challenge and this seemed like a good one to undertake. So I read a few books by Syd Fields, the great writer on screenplays, and read a whole bunch of screenplays and then did the adaptation myself. 

 I sent it to my agent on a lark and much to my surprise, he really liked it and said: “Let's send it out.” Deepa was first on my list. I knew she loved the book and we had already done a radio play based on the Radha Auntie story. So we sent it to her and she said she was interested, but she wanted a “big change”. I met with her, nervous about what this “big change” might be, and after we had ordered our coffees, she leaned towards me and said: “Shyam, you've gone too far from the book. You need to come closer to it.” Well, after that I trusted her completely and we worked on the screenplay, draft by draft. Deepa is an excellent editor. She knows how to give a note in such a way that it leaves room for the writer to come up with a creative solution. So I would go away and work on whatever it was that she required and email the script to her. 

 Her first reaction would always be enthusiastic, like “it's fantastic!” But then, within hours, she would come back with suggestions for change and I would incorporate those. It truly was a great experience working with her. She was always open to suggestions and would always consult me on casting. She listened when I suggested Nimmi Harasgama and Brandon Ingram as well as other cast members and tried them out. So I was very involved in the whole process from start to finish, and was very grateful she allowed me to be. It's not necessary or required that the writer be involved; it's quite the norm for the writer to hand in the screenplay and that's it. Next time you know anything about it, you're sitting in the cinema watching it. 


 Were there any specific requests you insisted on when it came to the adaptation? 

 No. There didn’t seem to be a need to put in specific requests as I was involved from beginning to end. Also, if you want to be a screenwriter, you must accept that film is a director’s medium. I accepted that from the beginning. After all, I have my novels in which it is my singular vision. In the end, my job was to shape the screenplay to the director’s vision, and this I accepted and believed in. And when Deepa went to Sri Lanka for pre-production, I handed the screenplay over to her and backed off. I wanted the best possible film and that meant leaving her to live and dream in the film, without my voice like an annoying fly buzzing around. 

   

 The film is being directed by Oscar-nominated Indian film director Deepa Mehta. Did you have any concerns at all with your story based in Sri Lanka being handled by someone who is not Lankan themselves? 

   

 No, none. She had made two films in Sri Lanka already and knew the place well, and also the Colombo milieu the film (and novel) takes place in. She’s also really good at melding the political and personal, and so I knew she would do all that justice in the film. I was there working on the screenplay and writing scenes to show the political and social reality of Sri Lanka, and taking a request of hers and writing the scene in a way that was very authentically Sri Lankan. 

 Was it important for you to cast Sri Lankan actors in the main roles? What are your thoughts on the performances of the leads? 

 I really wanted the leads to be Sri Lankan as far as possible. But not just any Sri Lankans. I wanted actors who were familiar with the Colombo cosmopolitan – the multi-ethnic milieu in which the film (and novel) takes place. It still feels like a dream come true that we were able to get actors familiar with this milieu and I loved their performances. There is an authenticity to gesture and accent and movement that you can’t find any other way. And for them, this is their story. Nimmi’s mother is Tamil, and since we’re raised in our mother’s culture, this makes her effectively Tamil. So she knew firsthand that Colombo Tamil milieu and turned to her mother to get the Tamil right. Like for me, 1983 was very personal for her because of all her beloved aunts and uncles and cousins who were affected by it. 

   

 Have you had an opportunity to screen the finished product? What do you think of the overall movie? Does it capture what you intended through your novel? 

  
 Yes, I have seen it; Deepa arranged a special screening in a theatre for me, my partner, and a few other people. Despite being so close to the film, I found it almost unbearable to watch towards the end during the riots scenes, and nearly left the theatre. This told me that we have made a great film. When I saw my name in the credits, it was magical. I turned to my partner and whispered: “It’s real, it’s real.” Most writers never get their novels made into film. Most adaptations are a disappointment. Sometimes I have to pinch myself; it feels so unreal, that one, my novel was adapted into a film, and two, it was so perfect! 
   

 Speaking of your general thoughts on book-to-novel adaptations, do you believe what an author intends via their novel can truly be captured through a different medium such as film? 

 Yes, it can be captured.    Funny Boy    is proof! ",,2JJTpNC6nWPsjopYOzghxBU8z3s2,Sachintha Heshan,0,Sometimes I have to pinch myself: Shyam Selvadurai,brunch,0,1603576857,0,102403,,
,,Sandun Seneviratne’s Vikaari at Screamfest 2020,brunch," 

 By Dimithri Wijesinghe 

 The Sri Lankan short film    Vikaari   , co-directed by Sandun Seneviratne, won “Best Short Film” at Screamfest Horror Film Festival 2020 on 15 August. 

 The event is America’s largest and longest-running horror movie festival, awarding the year’s top genre movies, filmmakers, actors, and screenplays. 

  Vikaari    was the first Sri Lankan film to be screened at the festival and stars Sri Lankan actors Ashan Dias and Bimsara Premaratne, along with British actor Richard de Roberts. Produced as a science fiction short film, the story draws attention towards children born with the same type of deformity around the world and the fears that result from it. 

 We spoke to Seneviratne, who wrote, produced, and directed the film together with fellow London Film Academy alumni Charlie Bray. Seneviratne shared that while he has been making short films for nearly two decades now,    Vikaari    was his second big project, with the first being a web series he created, titled    Seer: Death Sight    and available for viewing on Facebook. 

 He shared that it has been an incredible honour to be screened at Screamfest, especially considering the significance of the festival for genre films; the festival is where American supernatural horror franchise Paranormal Activity was discovered. 

 “All credit must go to my collaborators,” said Seneviratne, as he spoke about the filming and production process for    Vikaari   . He said it was actually filmed five years ago and spent many years in post-production. 

 Stating that he has always aspired to make a Hollywood storytelling style-inspired film of that very same calibre, and as they did not quite have the funding to have the level of visual effects (VFX) bigger films tend to have, he said that instead of compromising on the quality, they decided to ask for favours from their friends in the industry who agreed to work on the project in their off hours, which resulted in the process taking a very long time. “This lockdown period was actually when we finally managed to finish the project,” he added. 

 Seneviratne also shared that some of the topics they addressed in the story, such as racism and the cost of prejudice, while always issues at hand, did not garner this level of attention back when he started to film the project as it does now in 2020; the awareness of social issues has allowed the film to age quite well and remain relevant. 

 The filming of    Vikaari    was done primarily in Sri Lanka, leaving a few scenes which were shot in the UK, and Seneviratne shared that the cast was pretty much a no-brainer; he went with his long-time friend Dias and Premaratne, with whom he had worked before. As for the child actors, he shared that he held an extensive auditioning process through which he came across the wonderful cast of young actors – Nethuli Adihetti, Nithila Goonetilleke, and Thinuga Adihetti. 

 We also spoke to both Dias and Premaratne. The latter shared her filming experience with Seneviratne, stating that while they could not ever have said for sure that it would be an award-winning film at its inception, she always knew it was going to be special. She said that the recognition is owed to the film’s subject matter and the fact that Seneviratne did not compromise on his vision despite the obstacles. 

 She said they filmed largely in front of a green screen and with a lot to be done in post-production and they too did not have a clear picture of the end product. Regardless, she said that it was an enjoyable process as they were all friends working together – both directors knew what they wanted but they were gentle about directing and were very easy to work with. 

 Premaratne also shared that most actors would prefer for their work to come out as soon as possible and that she too would often text Seneviratne and ask whether it is actually getting released. However, she added that she is glad the director did not compromise on his creative vision and persevered and utilised the full-time frame he required to put the project together. 

 Dias also shared his thoughts about the project, stating: “Working in a sci-fi genre was definitely a new and unique experience, because this sort of genre has not been common in Sri Lankan cinema so far. Having said that, we always ask, ‘why not?’ And Sandun Seneviratne finally answered that question when he took this leap of faith. 

 “Sandun has always been someone who questions the norm and aims for pinnacles that we as Sri Lankans usually wouldn’t dare to. I knew this about him, as I knew him before this, and I knew his background and where and how he did his professional training, so I knew this was going to be something special. It was indeed an eye-opening and rewarding experience to work on this project with him.” 

 On a closing note, both actors and the director shared their thoughts on the Sri Lankan cinema industry. Seneviratne stated that he himself has an ultimate goal to make a feature-length film – a sci-fi action film with an international cast that is Sri Lankan and also from the Asian region and all over the world. He said Sri Lanka is a small country and therefore it is difficult to sustain a large film industry. 

 While art house films are doing very well here, commercial cinema is yet to make its mark, but he believes that the future of cinema is progressively more democratised as people are realising it is a lot cheaper now to make a film, and similarly, it is easier now to reach an audience without a big production company behind you. “Making a good film is not about the budget, the big stars, but the type of story you are telling,” he said.  

 “There is a lot that needs to be fixed in our local industry if we are to at least ‘sustain’ it in this age of digitalisation and the internet. But I feel like we cannot achieve any sort of progress until the older generation of filmmakers relinquish their monopoly and work towards establishing a system where everybody is equal and has equal opportunities if they have the talent. I hope this win Sandun Seneviratne brought to Sri Lanka will in some way motivate this line of thinking, so we can resurrect a dying industry,” Dias said. 

 Premaratne also added that the future is definitely promising. With Netflix and a lot of animated features and such making their way into the mainstream, it has opened up way more avenues for youths to explore their art, and Sri Lanka undoubtedly has the potential. Especially when it comes to genre films and the future, all you really need is a vision, a good concept, and a strong drive, and we are sure to see some exciting things ahead, she said.

,,"Lion Air plane crash: Debris found in sea off Jakarta, Indonesia",international,"An Indonesian passenger plane carrying 189 people, including one child and two infants, has crashed into the sea close to the capital Jakarta, minutes after takeoff. 
The Lion Air flight JT 610 was carrying 181 passengers, as well as six crew members and two pilots, when it disappeared from radar during a short flight from Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang on Monday morning, according to Indonesia's National Search and Rescue Agency (SAR). 
The plane, a new Boeing 737 MAX 8, took off from Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Tangerang, Greater Jakarta at 6.21 a.m. local time,   and had been due to land at around 7:30 a.m. in Pangkal Pinan, the largest city on the Indonesian island of Bangka. 
Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said there were 20 ministry officials on board, who were returning to their posts in Pangkal Pinang after spending the weekend with their families in Jakarta for a public holiday. 
Debris, life vests and a cellphone have been discovered in the water two nautical miles from the coordinates given as the crash site, SAR officials said. The fuselage has not yet been located. 

Boats, a helicopter and 250 rescuers, including divers, were working at the crash site, some 34 nautical miles off the coast near Jakarta in the Java Sea. The frogmen are searching in water up to 35 meters (114 feet) deep.

Images have been released by Indonesia Disaster Mitigation Agency showing officials examining what appears to be debris from the plane. Video shows an oil slick at the presumed site of the crash.

Authorities said they are still trying to locate the Emergency Locator Transmitter which is currently not transmitting.  (Courtesy CNN)

 Ukwatte, speaking to The Morning, shared that upon identifying temperature hikes in the employees of both hotels, the staff were immediately isolated, the hotels were shut down, and all the staff present at the time tested; the staff are being kept in the hotel for a few days, until the results are released. 

 “With the latest development, most hotels have been asked to minimise staff movement for ten days to two weeks. With staff who travel by public transport, we try to keep them in the hotels; provide them accommodation.   We’re doing temperature checks on all the employees 3 times a day, recording them, and we also make sure a doctor is in house or nearby, so we can immediately call for medical advice and help.” 

 “This is a pandemic and the virus spreads with human contact. Hotels are places where people gather. They are high risk areas. We have all these protocols in place -- we do temperature checks on our staff as well as our guests so we can detect a fever. We have our guests register their names, ID numbers and addresses for contact tracing.  

 Ukwatte urged all Sri Lankans to be very careful. “Hotels can take all the precautions, but if visitors bring the virus to the hotels, that’s another problem.” 

 “The hotel industry is unfortunately severely impacted with this virus.   If you find that you are unwell, we kindly urge you not to visit hotels. Cooperate with us to give us the support that we require right now.” 

 Ukwatte, however, noted: “Nothing is 100% foolproof. Outsiders who come in for weddings etc. can bring in the virus. There’s a risk there.”

,,One for the road: Colombo’s bars and nightclubs in the wake of Covid-19’s resurgence,brunch," The second wave of Covid-19 has sent many of us reeling. Following the first wave of Covid-19 and the subsequent lockdown, Sri Lankans were more or less returning to their normal lives when the second wave hit. There were those of us complacent and those of us very concerned about a potential second wave. For the most part, people tried to resume normal activities while paying attention to their health and safety, adhering to the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health as much as possible. 

 Bars and nightlife were very heavily hit by the pandemic. In general, once the lockdown was lifted, things were picking up, but now with the second wave having hit, bar and club owners look to be in for another time of hardship.    The Sunday Morning Brunch    spoke with some of Colombo’s favourite establishments for their views on how they’re adapting. 

Dealing with the first wave 
 The islandwide lockdown that was instituted overnight hit restaurants hard. Selling alcohol was also prohibited during the lockdown, and even once the lockdown was lifted, general medical opinion discouraged bars and clubs selling alcohol for fears of breeding infection. 

 Many restaurants and bars turned to delivery during the lockdown, and the delivery business began to boom. The end of the lockdown in May meant that people were now able to go back to restaurants. The first few weeks after the lockdown were slow, but gradually the general public started coming out of their shells and started going out on the town again, although in significantly fewer numbers than before. 

 Harpo’s Hotels, Cafes, and Restaurants Founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Harpo Gooneratne noted that August and September saw things moving positively. “Most of the restaurants were seeing approximately 70-80% of the activity they saw at the same time last year, which was after the Easter attacks. Some restaurants were doing quite well in the sense that they were breaking even and keeping their heads above water.” 

The second wave 
 The second wave took people quite by surprise. After months of no internal spread of infection, there was a new cluster that quickly grew, with over 2,000 active cases to date. 

 For many industries, the second wave has come as a huge blow at a time when things were just starting to pick up. When news of the new cluster of Covid-19 infections broke, the Ministry of Health stressed the importance of following the health and safety regulations to minimise the spread of the infection. 

 But how badly is the second wave affecting businesses like bars and nightclubs? In many cases, this second wave seems to be having a worse impact than the first. 

 “From a restaurant point of view, this wave is worse,” Gooneratne said. “The first wave saw businesses shut down because there was zero business. With the second wave, people are actively not coming to restaurants anymore. They’re obviously worried. The fear psychology is quite strong. We don’t know exactly where we’re going and when this is going to end. Every day, there are more reports of cases being discovered. It’s a matter of looking and seeing.” 

 Rhythm and Blues (R&amp;B) Managing Director Russell Fernando shared that while business was steadily picking up, the second wave has resulted in almost no footfall. “Before October, things were coming back to normal. We were experiencing maybe a 20% drop from our normal attendance. Now, with the second wave, it’s really bad; we may even need to close temporarily. In the long term, it all depends; if cases were only being reported in quarantine centres, it wouldn’t matter, but if it’s happening in the community, then it’s different. Who wants to go out and spend money on having a good time at the risk of catching the virus?” 
 
Adapting to the second wave 
 With no choice but to adapt to the second wave, some restaurants, as they did in the past, are turning towards strengthening their delivery systems. “This time around, people are much more cautious about stepping out than they were before. It’s starting to hit home,” explained Taphouse by RnR Operations Manager Sampath Perera. “The second wave has affected footfall heavily. We are trying to focus more on food sales and delivery, working with delivery apps to get more going on that side.” 

 From a dine-in perspective, Perera explained that Taphouse has scaled down operations significantly to ensure that large gatherings are avoided. “Part of the responsibility is on us to be mindful and avoid large congregations for now. We have stopped all live entertainment for now, and for those who dine in, we are focusing on following the health and safety regulations as strictly as possible.” 

 The Irish Bar &amp; Grill Owner Sasha Jayasundera shared that in the case of The Irish Bar &amp; Grill, as well as her other venture, the karaoke bar Sopranos, health and safety regulations are being followed very closely, with small changes also being made in layout and furnishing to promote social distancing. 

 “We have always encouraged social distancing in our establishments and are now following regulations more closely. Before, you couldn’t really stop people from staying away from each other once they come in, but now we’ve made sure all chairs are placed at least one metre apart. We’ve also taken away our bar stools for the moment. The Irish Bar &amp; Grill is a large area and we’re using this to our advantage. We also have an outdoor area on the roof, and many customers prefer to eat outdoors at the moment. 

 “With Sopranos, it's an indoor space and we have arranged it in such a way that people will adhere to social distancing and have taken out some furniture to aid in this. We also encourage our guests to wear masks as much as possible and to use greeting methods that don’t require physical contact. We also place a heavy focus on frequently sanitising hands.” 

 Fernando explained that in the case of R&amp;B, and his other venture, The Chiller Room, they have been following guidelines strictly, only accepting 50% of their occupancy at any given time. In terms of managing regulations in a nightclub setting, Fernando explained that this has meant taking steps that have impacted the nightclub experience. “The dance floor has not been active. We’ve been operating as a bar, with only background music playing and no dancing allowed. It isn’t the same nightclub experience as it used to be.” 

Hope for the future? 
 The future is looking quite bleak for establishments in the bar and nightlife scene. While these are circumstances that are uncontrollable, there is still an impact felt on businesses in addition to the general uncertainty caused by the pandemic. 

 “We’ll have to wait and see how it goes,” Fernando said, adding: “At the moment, it’s really bad. If people don’t go out, we’ll need to close for sure. The market is also very small. From the whole of Colombo, approximately 1,500 people maximum go out on a Friday night. Since we can only focus on locals, everyone is trying to get a piece of this pie. With fewer people going out, you maybe have 500 people going out, which means one establishment may receive only about 30 or 40 people visiting at most.” 

 The upcoming Christmas and New Year season, which normally is a time that sees a lot of traction in the dining and nightlife circuit, also looks very uncertain. “We don’t know yet if there will be a Christmas or New Year season. Two weeks ago, no one thought we would be in this current scenario,” Gooneratne, who is also the President of the Colombo City Restaurant Collective (CCRC), said. “We will plan things on paper for December; plans will be less extravagant and I feel it will be a very toned down season across the board. I don’t think restaurants and bars will be spending a lot of money on decor and entertainment. Obviously, people from overseas, even Sri Lankans living overseas, won’t be able to come back into the country. We also need to be mindful about the disposable income people have. Salaries are being cut.” 

 Some still hold out hope. “Sri Lankans are very fast to get back to their day-to-day lives, and they also try not to let the negativity affect their positive attitudes,” Jaysundera said, adding: “Once everything is sorted, and the infections are under control, it will give them the confidence to get out once again.”

,,The Western Musicians’ Association: Strengthening the field from within,brunch,"The entertainment industry has been one of the hardest hit by Covid-19. The first wave saw a nationwide lockdown instituted for nearly three months, as well as the need to majorly scale back on all public events. The intervening months between the lockdown and the second wave of Covid-19 infections earlier this month was something of a respite, with many industries beginning to bounce back. 
The last two weeks have shattered our fragile – if somewhat complacent – sense of security. With parts of the island under lockdown when required, and public events being massively curtailed, if not outright prohibited, the entertainment industry is back to a virtual standstill. 
The Sunday Morning Brunch sat down with a few members of the Western Musicians’ Association (WMA) for a look at how western musicians are being impacted by Covid-19, and how the Association and the western music industry as a whole are responding to the pandemic. 


Sri Lanka’s western music industry is quite strong and diverse, and includes bands, duos, soloists, symphonies, and choirs. “There are over 1,300 musicians in the western music industry across all forms of music and all skill levels. Around 60-70% of these musicians are full-time musicians. This is why the WMA was formed – to cover all these different types of musicians and look after them and help them grow,” WMA Vice President Rajitha Rupasinghe explained. 
WMA President Fabion Bonnie Paul shared that Sri Lanka’s western musicians predominantly produce English music, although there are musicians who produce in other languages as well.

Many Sri Lankan bands get contracts that see them playing in Europe, the Middle East, and Australia. We have many bands that are on par with the best in the world. Like any industry, we have different levels of musicians, and while we have lots of established bands, there are also bands that are struggling. The WMA wants to prop these bands up and bring them up to a level that Sri Lanka as an entity can be proud of.” 
Established in 2016, the WMA was formed in response to a dire need to be able to bring the western music community together and look into issues that affected the welfare of the community as a whole. 
“Because of the nature of our work, we don’t have steady jobs, retirement schemes, etc.,” Rupasinghe shared. “The WMA came into the picture in 2013 in order to actively look at musicians’ needs, especially if they get sick or have other needs, and to move the industry forward as a strong entity.” 
The WMA serves as a platform to uplift the standards of western music in Sri Lanka and help western musicians grow. 
“We organise knowledge-sharing initiatives that can help bring musicians up, and give them access to training programmes and other initiatives they can’t access by themselves. We also work to set standards across the industry and avoid undercutting and musicians being taken advantage of in the marketplace,” Paul said. 
Paul spoke about the lack of standardisation in the western music industry, particularly in the case of how hotels and other venues engage bands for entertainment. “There are no real valid contracts in place most of the time. Bands are easily thrown out of hotels with little to no notice, and even when engaging in services, there is extensive bargaining with the understanding that the venue can always easily find another musician to play in their space. This leads to a lot of undercutting. One of the things the WMA is working towards is the standardisation of how bands are engaged by entertainment venues and hotels. 
“One of the main advantages of an association like the WMA is that issues that have the potential to affect all musicians can be addressed formally,” Paul explained, speaking of an incident where one of Colombo’s five-star hotels implemented a rule saying that local bands and musicians could no longer enter the hotel through the main entrance, but only through the service entrance reserved for suppliers. 
“The WMA took this matter up with the hotel in question. It was a rule exclusive only to local musicians and musicians were helpless. The WMA was able to give musicians a voice, and this rule was withdrawn. The hotel also issued a formal apology.” 
The WMA also works towards forming strategic partnerships with corporates to enable greater collaborations between the western music industry and other industries. They have currently formed over 40 such strategic partnerships with companies including JAT Holdings, Dynamic AV, and, most recently, telecom company GENXT. 

Responding to Covid-19 as an industry“Not just musicians, everyone was struggling to start with when the pandemic hit. One of WMA’s immediate forms of action was to distribute rations to members of our community with the help of Manusath Derana. We also initiated discussions with the Government on a relief loan for western musicians, speaking with various ministers, the Prime Minister, and finally, His Excellency, at which point we and 15 other musician associations were given a relief loan. The WMA was the sole representative for western musicians in this respect, while the other associations involved all represented different fields like oriental music,” Rupasinghe said. 
He shared that being able to obtain relief funds from the Government for western musicians was a big step because there is no industry for musicians in Sri Lanka. “There is a recognised cinema industry, but not a music industry. We’re slowly building recognition and getting there, but we are not yet a recognised industry.” 
The second wave of the pandemic has left musicians feeling worse than before. “People found solutions after the lockdown,” Paul explained, adding: “Musicians were slowly starting to get their livelihoods back on track. From July, there was very slow progress, and by September and October, we were starting to receive more inquiries and the country was also stable. Popular bands were getting gigs, hotels were booking entertainment, and clubs were packed. 
“The second wave changed all this. Smaller bands that were still hoping to pick up after the lockdown haven’t had the chance. Popular bands were sustained for a bit. But the smaller bands have little to no hope. We can’t go to the ministry level for another relief loan. Options are more limited this time around.” 
Rupasinghe commented that the WMA has reactivated loan discussions with the Government, but with the country’s overall current situation, it is a difficult task, even though a similar loan was given before. 

Building a sustainable future
The future does look bleak for musicians, particularly in the short term. “Personally, I don’t see any light at the end of the tunnel for musicians,” Rupasinghe said. “Every day, you see hundreds of active cases being reported. Musicians are directly hit in a crisis like this because the first response is to stop public gatherings and events. This directly impacts the music industry because we are performers at such events.” 
Paul shared that the WMA has proposed some initiatives with hotels for people to come listen to music. “When things relaxed after the first wave, we weren’t careful. We went with the flow – pubs became dances, dances became ballroom events, and we have put ourselves in a position which we can’t even control because we destroyed it by not being careful when things were improving between waves.” 
WMA Executive Committee Member Neranjan De Silva noted that there has been a shift to virtual in the industry as a response to Covid-19, and one of the benefits of this is that copyrighting music will be easier. 
“Copyright for western music is an issue in Sri Lanka. With oriental artists and Sinhala music, copyright is seen too. For western music, we don’t own rights because it is usually someone else’s. Original music that western musicians create comes under international copyright laws. It is normally implemented by third parties. The law doesn’t get involved. If someone steals your music, it is up to you to pursue legal action, and may not have the resources to do so. 
“In the UK, this is policed by the Performing Right Society. Sri Lanka doesn’t have a society of this nature, and it is not something the WMA can take on. By going virtual through platforms like YouTube, the platform itself policies for copyright infringement, protecting the musicians’ rights,” De Silva said. 
The WMA’s main objective now is to raise funds and create a secure fund to help musicians. It had several fundraisers lined up to raise funds before the second wave, including a virtual concert. “There are musicians who really struggle. This is so in every industry. We haven’t been able to do any of the fundraising events we had initially planned because of the second wave. The industry is a good industry to be in, but it has been hit badly by Covid-19. This is a situation beyond anyone’s control.”

,,Life after yoga: Sathya Yoga and Wellness,brunch," Former strategy consultant turned classical hatha yoga instructor Rekha Krishnamoorthy founded Sathya Yoga and Wellness here in Sri Lanka and has since been sharing the classical yogic practices primarily through monthly or bimonthly workshops,   private consultation sessions  , wellness retreats, and corporate programmes. 

 The use of the word “classical” refers to a system of hatha yoga that has been handed down by a master teacher/Guru and taught in its purity for self-transformation and complete inner wellbeing.

 Rekha shared her journey that led her to discover the path of yoga and leaving behind the corporate world. “I went through a difficult time under sudden and challenging circumstances. As per my usual coping mechanism, for the most part I immediately buried myself in work, and my role as a strategy consultant in Chicago meant that I was engaged and buried in work most of my days,” she shared. 

 However, she said that things soon changed and distracting herself proved to be exhausting and unsustainable. “As life has it, distracting myself from the trauma of the tragedy, in conjunction with corporate burnout, caught up with me, and less than a year later I started experiencing severe anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, and other physical ailments,” she said. 

 When her physical and mental wellbeing started to take a toll was when the turning point came in her life, which kick-started her journey into self-care and spirituality. 

 “I resigned from the corporate world and left for India to undertake a yoga teacher training programme, where I spent five months engaged in a residential yoga teacher training programme at the Isha Yoga Centre founded by Sadhguru,” she said. 

 She shared that during this teacher training, she experienced significant transformations, both physically and on many other levels, many of which cannot quite be put into words. However, they’ve all had an undeniable positive impact on her physical and mental health. She stated that the way she experienced life changed fundamentally – her interactions with others, her perception of her own self, the lightness in her body, and the intensity of joy that was within her. 

 “When I discovered the potential of yoga as a self-transformation and healing tool, I was determined to share this ancient and sacred science with others. As a result, I decided to embrace the path of yoga wholeheartedly and help others embark on their own journey towards complete wellbeing,” she explained. 


 Rekha’s training was in classical hatha yoga, under the guidance of Sadhguru. The practices she teaches empowers one with the tools for inner wellbeing, and, according to her, this is what differentiates her teachings. 

 Malaysia-born, having completed her primary and secondary education primarily in Europe, and finally having worked with Stax Inc. for nearly a decade in Sri Lanka and the US,   we asked Rekha why is it that she chose Sri Lanka to invest in Sathya Yoga and Wellness  , to which she said: “I chose to come and share the ancient science of yoga in its purity in Sri Lanka, as I believe there is a need for classical yoga to help people overcome stress, trauma, and anxiety, and for their overall wellbeing. The sheer amount of tragedy the people of Sri Lanka have undergone just in the last 30-40 years alone inspired me to want to offer tools for wellbeing here.” 

 Having once worked in Sri Lanka for Stax Inc. in Colombo as a consultant, she was familiar with the country and its people, and has come to love the island over the years. She said that when she first came here, there were very few classical yoga studios in the island, adding that the teaching of eastern sciences such as yoga, qi gong, and tai chi is a market that is highly saturated in Malaysia, India, and Thailand. However, in Sri Lanka, we were yet to embrace it. She also added that overall, she just felt a natural affinity to Sri Lanka. 

 Rekha shared that Sri Lanka, however, is now starting to make positive strides in the wellness space with sustainable balance of self-care and spirituality, adding that she was thrilled to see the recent initiative adopted by Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs Namal Rajapaksa in making yoga and meditation mandatory for all national sports squads in the country, which she believes to be a step in the right direction as Sri Lankan athletes only stand to benefit from this decision.  

 For those who feel that ‘yoga is not for me’ 

 There is a misconception that yoga is purely a physical practice, but physical benefits such as weight loss, flexibility, and toning are just the wonderful byproducts of yoga, said Rekha, sharing that just about anyone can pursue yoga as a practice as there are no prerequisites on the path of yoga, but a commitment to one’s wellbeing. What it really does is allow you to return to your true nature by bringing a certain inner balance and ease to the body and mind. 

 There’s an abundance of benefits you will experience once you adopt the practice of yoga into your lifestyle, including physical fitness, inner peace, control over your daily compulsions, increased energy levels, and better mental clarity and focus, and all of these benefits stem from the practice of yoga restoring your inner system to its natural state, which then allows your body to function from a state of balance and ease, changing the way you respond to and manage external forces and challenges such as stress. 

 Rekha carries out her teachings primarily through workshops for employees of organisations such as Perigon Lanka, select University of Kelaniya medical trainees, Persistent Systems Lanka, and Unilever; wellness retreats at Soul Resorts, The Fortress Resort and Spa, Santani Wellness Resort and Spa, Aditya Resort, The Kingsbury Colombo, and Jetwing Ayurveda Pavilions; as well as collaboratively work with Workout.lk and Spa Ceylon to conduct wellness programmes. 

 She added that these programmes are tailored to give the people the opportunity to disconnect and reset their body, mind, and souls. Typical wellness retreats encompass holistic health sessions including yoga, meditation, Ayurveda, and healthy eating.

,,Sri Lanka's first supermarket tracker to monitor shopping parameters,business," SRL unveils SuperTrak to monitor shopper parameters 

 Retail today is being shaped by the empowered customer, who demands convenience, customisation, collaboration, and consistency. One of the key ways for retailers to address this demand is by becoming more data driven. 

 
  Relying on retail analytics and hard data rather than guesswork enables retailers to make smarter decisions toward higher profits, better customer satisfaction, and a more successful store overall. This has become the trend globally, with retailers in countries like the UK and the US employing retail analytics in order to get insight into how well marketing is working, what customers actually do when they enter a store, and whether there is an end result to their visit, such as a sale.  

 
  Sri Lankan retailers are now given this same opportunity to become more data driven, thanks to Survey Research Lanka (SRL), which relaunched SuperTrak, Sri Lanka's first-ever supermarket tracker to monitor shopper parameters. This relaunch happened during the research and consultancy firm's 31st anniversary, at which time they also unveiled the revamped SRL website with a new and improved data-driven site, a new standalone platform for the existing SRL NewsTrak which tracks all TV, print, radio, and digital news and SRL CosNet which helps assess the effective and efficient use of above the line (ATL) marketing budgets.   
  SRL SuperTrak acts as a comprehensive system to track information related to modern trade retail business; a collective report management system to know the consumer and product-related data in Sri Lankan supermarkets.  

 Speaking to    The Sunday Morning Business   , SRL CEO Mihirani Dissanayake stated that SRL SuperTrak was the first of its kind in Sri Lanka, and was first initiated by the organisation in the late 2000s . She explained that since then, their services have been used by several big name brands, whose data they keep private.   
  The system uses the invoices collected from an immense number of households around Sri Lanka as the primary data source to generate the reports. The panel of consumers span across all the Social Economic Classification (SEC) classes of Sri Lanka, which is a classification using parameters such as the occupation and highest education of the household's main wage earner. The organisation has currently collected more than 6,000 bills a month and gives at least 80,000-100,000 entries of purchase history. Every product in the supermarket display is captured this way, and makes them achieve more than 95% accuracy.   
  ""We are currently working with around 800 households who send us 75% of their purchase data, so that we can create a clearer picture for our clients,” said Dissanayake.  

  When looking at what percentage of consumers are purchasing a certain brand, SRL SuperTrak expresses it as a percentage of consumers who purchased a particular brand’s product, compared to the total consumers who purchased the particular category of the product; for example, if 45% of shampoo buyers from supermarkets are purchasing company ABC’s shampoos bearing the brand name of “XYZ”.   
  If Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) manufacturers want to know what percentage of shoppers buy the category of products they produce, the system expresses it as a percentage of consumers that purchased a particular product category, compared to the total shoppers.  

 
  It showcases the volume share of a company's product by showing the percentage of a brand’s purchased weightage compared to its category’s consumed volume. Moreover, a product's value share is expressed as a percentage of a brand’s purchased market price compared to its category’s consumed price.   
  SRL SuperTrak also gives the volume and value-wise percentage of product brand movement at each supermarket chain and represents the number of families buying at a supermarket. This data also includes the spending power of the consumers towards the respective company's brand.   
  Retail analytics tools such as SRL SuperTrak provide invaluable insight to retailers and retailers need them to thrive in the future and make data-driven decisions.

,,"Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full",business," The 20  th   Amendment has been pushed through with the same haste as its predecessor, with little consideration of public opinion and those represented by the public to represent their opinion, choosing to tow their respective party lines. No surprises anywhere.   

The debate and vote, in the midst of rising cases of Covid-19, lockdowns, and even the first Covid-19 death in more than a month, had all the circus-like hallmarks of present-day parliamentary politics – catcalling and insulting slogans amid juvenile behaviour from both sides of the divide; a protest vehicle parade, Third Reich-inspired arm bands, and embroidered protest masks courtesy the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB); the stars and stripes raised inside the chamber; and the arrival of one Member of Parliament (MP) straight from prison, this time clad in personal protective equipment (PPE) to boot. And too few sane voices appealing to their fellow MPs to stand by their principles. Meanwhile, former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe’s United National Party (UNP), which propelled the 19  th   Amendment in part to create a stronger premiership for Wickremasinghe, is now reduced to a toothless farce, unable to even appoint a member to its sole parliamentary seat.   
  The damp squib of the two-day debate preceding Thursday (22) night’s vote showcased another feature of our present parliamentary culture. Debates, good or bad, do little to impact a final vote which goes all too predictably along party lines. In which event, parliamentarians need do little to make rousing, eloquent speeches fluent in the subject matter. MP Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, commenting on the experience of watching her peers, said: “The debate descended to the level of a bunch of boys trying to be macho, hurling insults at each other across the aisle; talking utter rubbish.”  

 
  One wonders how many of the 225 had actually read the amendment in full, and of those, how many have the faculty to make sense of its contents in the context of the very serious job of constitution making. It says a lot about our elected representatives that over 50 of the parliamentarians who voted to effectively repeal the 19  th   Amendment voted “for” it in 2015. Twenty of our senior MPs have in fact, voted for all four of the recent constitutional amendments – the 17  th  , 18  th  , 19  th   and 20  th   – unconscionable as that may seem.   
  In the run up to the debate, there had been enough said publicly and privately to suggest there was considerable discomfort even within the ruling party over some clauses at least. That in the end, even those vocal politicians submitted to the amendment is a sad indictment of their inability to take a principled stand for or against what they believe in. Or that they may be battered into submission for whatever reason.   
  Which brings us full circle to one of our favourite topics – the quality of those that represent us. Long gone are those representatives who voted in representation of their electorate and in keeping with their conscience. The collective responsibility held by Parliament has given way to a culture of yes men (and a few women) whose parliamentary actions are in sole allegiance to their party and/or their political masters. How far do they realise that in those hallowed halls, they represent far more than their narrow political ambitions? That in their hands lies the future trajectory of not just the country’s development but also the country’s morality and conscience?

,,Apparel heavyweights soldier on,business,"To early to forecast impact on December quarter 
 A fresh new cluster of Covid-19 cases is sweeping through Sri Lanka as new positive cases are found each day in different parts of the island. The resurgence of the virus came when an employee of Brandix, one of the country’s leading apparel manufacturers, tested positive for the virus on 4 October. 

 Further aggressive testing of their other employees confirmed that the disease had spread through their plant in Minuwangoda, Gampaha; as of Thursday, 22 October, the cluster had grown past 2,500 positive cases, making it the single largest cluster in the island. 

 However, according to Joint Apparel Association Forum Sri Lanka (JAAFSL) Secretary General Tuli Cooray, this is something that could have happened in almost any industry. Speaking to    The Sunday Morning Business   , he explained that the current pandemic is spreading amongst people and has nothing to do with the company’s practices. 

 “Brandix and its employees have been unfairly targeted due to this virus, but people need to understand that the company is part and parcel of our society, and a very important one at that. Brandix currently provides jobs to 50,000 Sri Lankans, which is more jobs than all the companies in most industries combined.” 

 The industry provides a means of employment to nearly 350,000 people directly and twice as many indirectly. These employment figures make up around 15% of the nation’s workforce. 

 Cooray stated that all the big apparel companies had adopted the health and safety practices dictated by local health authorities and the only reason this new cluster spread from the sector was due to the factories providing jobs for thousands of people who congregate in their premises. 

 “This has nothing to do with our practices; it's a problem everyone in Sri Lanka is facing, but fortunately, it did not stem from any other sector. This is because we account for more local livelihoods than those sectors.” 

 In the last few weeks, the country’s other two major apparel companies, MAS and Hirdaramani, also reported that some of their workers had tested positive for the virus. 

 According to Sri Lanka Apparel Exporters’ Association (SLAEA) Chairman Rehan Lakhany, this has caused a panic among Sri Lanka’s largest export markets such as the US and Europe. He explained that this was due to the local situation being blown out of proportion by the media and social media, despite the country’s competitors like India being in a worse situation. 

 The industry exports faced a setback last April and May during the initial outbreak and saw the country’s apparel exports fall by 82% and 49%, respectively,  month-on-month (MoM) compared to 2019. However, according to the JAAFSL website, the industry reduced its MoM deficit to 12% in August, and controlled the annual cumulative decline to 24% while strictly adhering to the guidelines given by the Government together with the health authorities. 

 “We do not know the impact this has had on our apparel exports yet, but there will definitely be an impact going forward. We are all working to mitigate the situation, but unfortunately there has been an unnecessary panic created amongst our customers,” said Lakhany. 

 Lakhany stated that most apparel manufacturers have already been following the Government's safety protocols and are even taking down the information of each of their employees to help the authorities when it comes to contact tracing. Moreover, these employees have also been trained by companies and have been told to avoid social events. 

 In light of the prevailing situation, we reached out to all three of these apparel manufacturers to learn how the situation has impacted them and what they have done to mitigate it. 

 Brandix 

 According to a Brandix spokesperson, the company has put in place health and safety protocols based on the regulatory authorities of Sri Lanka, including the protocol for the prevention and control of Covid-19 across all their facilities. They explained that the disease is new and evolving, and that they are still learning about the efficacy of their processes. 

 “Our independent investigation will help us understand if there has been a lapse on the part of our Minuwangoda plant in following the standards mentioned, and also the new controls that would be needed to augment our current processes to ensure the prevention and control of Covid-19. The emphasis at all our plants has been and will continue to be strict adherence to the protocol.” 

 The company is currently working with the regulatory authorities of Sri Lanka to implement the new recommendations to facilitate a sustainable operating model for the apparel industry in a Covid-19-prevalent environment. Adoption of continuous random PCR testing at all their plants, the recommended hostel operating model for their associates, and the additional controls in the recruitment process which includes comprehensive screening and PCR testing are some of the new practices they currently working towards implementing. 

 Speaking on the impact the current environment has had on their pre-existing orders, the spokesperson stated that as a result of the curfew implemented across areas adjacent to Minuwangoda, several of their plants in these areas have been impacted and that their teams are working in order to reschedule the impacted orders and minimise the impact to customers. 

 “We are extremely grateful to our customers for their understanding and extensive co-operation throughout this period as well.” 

 Furthermore, they stated that there has been an impact on employee attendance across the plants within the curfew restricted areas and in plants where employees are residing in curfew areas or are required to travel across such areas. 

 They explained that since the outbreak, their main focus has been to support their affected employees and their families, ensuring their recovery and return to normalcy. Teams across the group have rallied around to give their time by manning the many call centres and supported the relief efforts for their team members in hospital, quarantine centres, and home quarantine. 

 “Once these efforts are completed, we will assess the wider impact of the situation and determine the next course of action for our business.” 

 MAS Holdings 

 A spokesperson from MAS stated that before the first outbreak of Covid-19 in the country, the company already implemented health and safety protocols to prevent its spread. Following the months after the lockdown in March, these practices were continued without any deviation, reducing the possibility for any incidents to take place. Constant awareness was given to employees and the communities in which they operate, with the assistance of the public health inspector (PHI), the Ministry of Health, and local government health authorities. 

 They explained that following the second cluster of cases, these health and safety measures were further tightened with the support of MAS Technology Services. 

 “We have the technology to track information of our employees and their close associates. A continuous relationship is maintained with PHIs, MOH, and local government health authorities. In addition to this, we are conducting PCR tests on a weekly basis. This is the new normal and we continue to embrace it. Furthermore, MAS’ Covid Response Team continues to review the situation on a daily basis. As always, our first priority is the safety of our employees and we will continue to focus on these areas at any cost.” 

 Moreover, they stated that the group also came up with an emergency plan in the event where if one of their employees test positive for Covid-19, he/she would be directed to the company's own quarantine centres which are approved by the MOH and the relevant authorities, and will be further extended to the employees’ immediate families. 

 According to the company spokesperson, since the resurgence of the virus, there has been a drop in employee attendance. 

 “We have the technology and visibility to assess who is unable to report to work under these conditions. Following the police curfew imposed in some high-risk areas, we have decided and instructed our employees in these areas to remain safely at home, and the company has granted paid leave to these employees.” 

 They stated that their initial assessments indicate that there could be slight delays in the completion of a few orders due to facilities located within high-risk zones being closed by the company as a safety measure. However, they explained that their teams have proactively utilised available capacity within the group to minimise these potential delays. 

 “These are unprecedented times, but it’s encouraging to note that our strategic customers have been extremely supportive during these difficult times.” 

 The company spokesperson stated that it is still a little too early to assess the impact on their final quarter of 2020. Despite this, they stated that the situation in the country has not affected the demand from their customers. 

 “Provided we are able to keep to our delivery commitments, we do not envisage any significant adverse impact for the final quarter of 2020.” 

 Hirdaramani 

 Speaking to us, Hirdaramani Group Director Siddarth Hirdaramani stated that the company has been following extremely stringent health and safety regulations ever since the first Covid-19 case in the country was recorded in February this year. He explained that following the most recent developments, they have further reinforced these working practices by constantly communicating with their workforce on the importance of following these practices. 

 “From our end, we ensure that they are followed and inform their superiors of any symptoms. We have also created a very enabling work environment where individual associates feel that they can reach out to their supervisors, HR teams, and other management to address their needs, questions, and even ask for help. This puts us in a position to better understand the sentiments within each factory and to support our teams. All companies across the apparel industry have worked towards creating this supportive environment, and this has certainly helped us in this time.” 

 Hirdaramani stated that they have had a few expected delays owing to the current situation, and that there are many challenges the industry has had to address as a result of the pandemic. He explained that they are currently working with customers and stakeholders on how best to navigate and overcome them together, so as to support the industry as a whole. 

 He stated that the second cluster has also led to a higher rate of absenteeism in the company and that they have had to constantly reiterate their teams and employees, so that they should not be reporting to work if they are experiencing any Covid-19-related symptoms or even have been in contact with anyone else expressing those symptoms. 

 “Recent negative sentiments about the industry have also added to this, unfortunately, and this is why we recognise the importance of addressing unfounded misconceptions.” 

 Hirdaramani stated that while it is still too early to tell, they are expecting there to be some financial impact due to late shipments, factory closures, and absenteeism.

,,BIA’s Terminal 2 to begin construction on 30 November despite Covid 19,business," After running into numerous obstacles that delayed the implementation of the project for years, construction of Terminal 2 at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) is finally set to be launched on 30 November this year.  

 Speaking to    The Sunday Morning Business   , Airport and Aviation   Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd. (AASL) Chairman Maj. Gen. (Retd.) G.A. Chandrasiri noted that despite any obstacles they may face on the way, construction of the terminal will be launched on the scheduled date.  

 “We are having discussions back to back and we are getting ready to launch as planned. At the moment, we are doing some preliminary work such as soil testing,” Chandrasiri added.  

 He added that Terminal 2 will be completed in three years. Meaning by November 2023, the BIA would be able to handle a combined passenger capacity of 15 million.  

 The Japan International Co-operation Agency (JICA) is the concessionary loan provider for the new terminal at BIA. The loan agreement of Rs. 56 billion was signed over four years ago on 24 March 2016. The continued involvement of JICA in this project is interesting, as the Sri Lankan Government recently withdrew from the Light Rail Transit (LRT) Project which was to be funded by JICA, leading to damaged relations between Sri Lanka and long-term ally Japan, according to certain observers. 

 After years of delays driven by tender-related issues, the project was finally set to launch at end-August and was expected to be completed by August 2023 as a measure to mitigate passenger congestion issues.  

 However, in early August, the construction was postponed to early September due to complications in importing workers from Japan, China, Malaysia, Singapore, and various other countries amidst Covid-19. 

 Maj. Gen. Chandrasiri confirmed that changes were not made to the original design of Terminal 2 or to the earlier decision to award the tender to Taisei Corporation, a Japanese construction company. AASL signed the contract agreement with Taisei on 12 March. 

 Accordingly, the new terminal will be built at a cost of $ 800 million and is expected to handle a passenger capacity of nine million as initially planned while the existing terminal handles about six million passengers annually.  

 The new terminal building would feature the addition of 96 check-in counters, eight baggage claim belts, seven baggage makeup carousels, 16 contact boarding gates with 28 passenger boarding bridges, and six bus gates. The scope also includes a capacity enhancement of the incinerator, water treatment plant, and sewerage treatment plant. 

 The BIA has been in dire need of another terminal for years now. It had more than 170 aircraft movements per day, including an average of more than 60 movements of heavy aircraft per day in 2018. The existing six million-passenger terminal handled 10 million passengers in 2018, resulting in hours of delays, particularly as passengers were trying to collect their baggage. 

 According to the annual reports of AASL, the airport experienced heavy congestion in the arrival and departure zones, as well as vehicular traffic, particularly during peak hours; all  while passenger arrivals grew 5-6% Year-on-Year (YoY).

,,Dinan Kapuge – a young singing star from New York,tabloids," By Kusumanjalee Thilakarathna 

 Today on    Little Stars   , the spotlight is on a young star far away from his mother nation. His talents were brought to attention by Boston Lanka, a Sri Lankan media network based in the US. This young star, Dinan Kapuge, a budding musician who has excelled in piano, guitar, and drums, says his passion for singing was sparked by playing these instruments. He also plays the Sri Lankan traditional    geta beraya   . Currently living in New York, he dreams of coming to live in Sri Lanka one day. 

 Dinan, tell us about yourself. 

 My full name is Dinan Nipun Tharuka Kapuge, as given by my family. My first and middle names represent my older sisters – Dinan for Dilmi, my second oldest sister; Nipun for Nipuni, my oldest sister; and Tharuka for Tharushi, my youngest older sister. My last name Kapuge was passed on to me with generations to come. My loving parents are Wijitha Duminda Kapuge, my dad, and Diluka Kapuge, my mom. I attend Police Officer Rocco Laurie Intermediate School 72. My hobbies consist of playing my instruments, singing, drawing, and playing video games. I also play sports such as track and field as well as swimming. 

 Tell us more about your life in New York for our readers in Sri Lanka. 

 My hometown New York, also known as the “Big Apple”, gets together to sing, to go to temple events, and to have a fun time at family functions. 

 We recently came across some of the songs you have done with Boston Lanka Radio. Since when do you sing? 

 I started singing when I was very young; however, I got into singing when I was around seven or eight years old. I have been performing for “Ranga Tharanga” since 2014, which is an event that happens in Northeast America for Sri Lankan children, organised by the Staten Island Buddhist Vihara yearly, except for 2020 because of the pandemic. 

 What musical instruments do you play? 

 Playing instruments struck my desire for singing. I play instruments such as the piano, guitar, and drums. I’ve been playing the drums since I was nine years old in elementary school, when I was in the school band and the school’s jazz band. I also played traditional Sri Lankan drums like the “   geta bera   ”, taught by Uthpala Eroshan, which I had to be put on pause due to the amount of work I have. However, I would like to start again at some point. 

 Do you have any special instructors or trainers for music? 

 I have an instructor/trainer for music, who amplifies my vocal cords. My music teacher at my elementary school, Mrs. Caccase, taught me the fundamentals of music when I was in the Third Grade. She was an amazing teacher who taught me the basics. Later on, I also had a very nice guitar teacher, Uncle Vimal Fernando, who sparked my interest in Sri Lankan music. He is the one who found out that I had a talent for singing Sinhala songs and exposed me to various opportunities. 

 Later on, I was extremely lucky to meet a very inspirational Sri Lankan legend named Rookantha Gunathilaka. Even though we had such a very short time, he taught me how to extend my range when it comes to my vocals, how to play the piano, and how to sing western and Sri Lankan music. Ever since Uncle Rookantha left for Sri Lanka, Uncle Namal Hanarasinghe, a former keyboard player at “Superstars” (a leading band in Sri Lanka), has been coaching me. He has supported my singing from the start until now. 

 I am so thankful for what all my teachers have done for me. Even though my dad isn’t a teacher, he has helped me by practising with me at home and has been the biggest critic if I made any mistake. 

 Have you been to Sri Lanka? How do you feel when you think of Sri Lanka? 

 When I was only two years old, I was introduced to an exotic island called Sri Lanka. It was one of the best experiences I have ever had in my 13 years. I remember seeing the beautiful sights of Sri Lanka such as the Sigiriya Fortress, Yala National Park, Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, and other places. However, one major place I remember like it was yesterday is Pelmadulla, the place I call home. When I would visit my grandparents, I would later get in the back of my grandfather’s truck and pay a visit to my great-grandparents. They were always thrilled to see me and treated me like a king. 

 I don't remember much because I was only two-and-a-half years old and left for the US when I was five years old. I feel very proud when I think about our country and I feel very connected to my ancestors. As the years go on, I might even live in Sri Lanka when I grow up. I do miss Sri Lanka and hope to go back soon. 

 You lead a very active and balanced life, engaged in music and a lot of sports and also performing well in school. Can you tell us more about the sports you play? 

 When I was able to participate in sports and other activities when there was no pandemic, I did track and field, and swimming. I also used to do a form of martial arts called “kudo”, which I stopped after earning the blue belt. These three sports helped me to be more social and less scared of what people think of me. Participating in sports helped me build up my skills such as leadership, working with others, learning, and patience...and especially to deal with my three older sisters at home. Also, volunteering to sing at the senior centre; the joy on their faces and the endless amount of kisses fulfils my heart. 

 How do you manage your time to do all these things? 

 A key to being a successful individual is time management. Being active in every aspect helps me as a person. I make sure I’m at the top of my classes when it comes to studies, along with extracurricular activities, sports, music classes, and even having a blast with my friends! 

 Tell us more about some of your memorable achievements? 

 Some memorable achievements I have earned are the music award, reading award, and a certificate for being the best all-around student at my fifth-grade graduation. Another memorable achievement was winning my school talent show this year with more than 6,000 kids on board, and I’m so happy and proud. 

 What is your ambition? 

 Being a neurologist is a career path that has interested me ever since I was able to read. Brain surgeons have vast amounts of studies, anatomy, functions, and disorders that are associated with the nerves and the brain of the human body to learn. I want to find a way to prevent some brain illnesses or ways to improve the treatments. 

 Who is supporting your dreams? 

 Growing up, I had many supporters. However, my number one supporters have always been my family. My parents play a huge role in making me who I am today and who I am becoming. My sisters are always the ones to scream with enthusiasm through the audience, saying “GO MALLI!” 

 I had an astounding fusion band group called “Araliya” based in NY. Even though I’m a Buddhist, Father Nalaka Silva with open arms gave me so many opportunities to participate in most of the Catholic events. I can’t forget Uncle Sugath Fernando and Auntie Premila Ekanayake for the loads of support. I will forever appreciate their countless years of support.

,,Kiribath Publishers ensuring children’s mental wellbeing  ,tabloids,"  By      Kusumanjalee Thilakarathna 

 We know how important it is to take care of our physical health and when there is an ailment in our body, the symptoms are very clear to us most of the time. So it is easy to know when to get help. We know that our mental or emotional wellbeing is just as important as our physical health. But, it is not as easy to know when we should seek help to maintain or improve our mental wellbeing.  

 Mental health is not only about treating mental illness. Good mental health allows children and young people to develop the resilience to cope with whatever life throws at them and grow into well-rounded, healthy adults. Therefore, it is important to take care of our mental health, taking precautions and knowing when we need to ask for help. One of the best ways to educate ourselves about mental health is to read about it, especially books about mental health written for children. 

 Kiribath Publishers is an organisation which identified this need and introduced a variety of children’s books to help recognise mental health issues and teach how to cope with difficult situations. Kiribath Publishers is run by Shari de Costa and Sasha Jayamaha and in an interview with    Little Stars   , Sasha Jayamaha spoke about her new publication “   When Parents Argue”    and about the work they focus on at Kiribath Publishers.   

 Tell us about Kiribath Publishers.  

 Kiribath Publishers is run by Shari de Costa and myself and we started in 2019 when Sri Lanka faced the Easter Sunday bombings. Many children were affected by this terrible and scary situation. The counselling centre I run with my friend Nirmali Dias was asked to assist in the counselling process, but the scope was too large and the trauma was not something we were qualified to handle at the time. So, as a response, we agreed to write a book to help children deal with and process what they were facing. As we observed the response to the books, we began to write more and look for more writers and artists who shared our ideas and vision.  

 What Kiribath is today has grown organically over time and one thing we try to do is have books available in our country to help children handle hard situations which can affect them emotionally; books to help them love their beautiful island and also help them be more conscious about the world we live in.  

 One of our goals at Kiribath is to help children love the local  languages and have good-quality children’s books for everyone in their respective dialects.


 Tell us about yourself too.  

 I am an economist and a grief counsellor at ASA Counselling Centre. A counsellor is someone who walks with people through difficult situations and gives them tools and skills to cope with their situation. I am also a wife and mother of three beautiful children who are all under the age of five years.  


 Kiribath is an interesting name for a publishing house. Can you tell us why you picked that name? 

 
 Children often think of kiribath (milk rice) as comfort food and that is what we want our books to be – comfort for children.  


 Why is it important to read about what to do when bad things happen? 

 Sometimes reading helps us understand and connect with how we feel, which we may not know how to express. Sometimes we can also draw how we feel or talk about it, which is the best thing to do. But there are times we may not be able to do that, so being able to read and understand why we feel so sad helps. 

   

 It is not a pleasant thing when our parents argue. Why did you turn this unpleasant topic into a book for kids? 

 This was something we extracted out of counselling since most adults have been affected by their parents arguing or fighting and they’ve felt scared; not being able to work through how they feel since there was, at times, no one or any tools to help them. This is why this topic was needed. It is a common occurrence for parents to argue even in the best of homes and a huge part of a child’s world is their parents, so when you see your parents argue it can be a very scary and painful experience. But with this book, we can help children understand that adults make mistakes; they are not perfect and though they may argue, their parents love and care for them very much.  

 

 What inspired you to write for and work with kids? 

 My children are my inspiration. This book was dedicated to my 3-year-old son Akel since I watched him process an argument, and after chatting with him I understood what he was going through; I simply wrote this book for him to help him. Most of my books are for my kids and books I want them to have and read as they grow up.  

 

 Tell us about your future plans. 

 We have some books in the pipeline that we are excited about. If you follow our Facebook page or Instagram account you can see everything we are planning.  

 

 What books do you have?

 Right now we have several books out under Kiribath Publishers. One is    “Girl on the Sun”    which comes with a colouring book and is a wonderful book about imagination. We have a colouring book called    “Colour My Sri Lanka”    which depicts a journey around our island. We also have a book called    “I Went to Sigiriya”    which is a counting book for kids, and one of my favourites is our    “Guess Who?”    book which talks about animals we see on our island. Most of our books are available in three languages; Sinhala, Tamil, and English.

,,Local attractions for local tourists  : Sri Lanka Tourism plans domestic campaign,business," By The Sunday Morning Business Desk     

 With the reopening of the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) likely to be further delayed due to the emergence of a second Covid-19 wave, Sri Lanka Tourism is planning a campaign to promote local destinations to domestic tourists.  

 Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) Chairperson Kimarli Fernando told. The Sunday Morning Business    recently that the SLTDA is in the process of selecting a public relations (PR) firm to undertake the promotional campaign.  

 “Because of Covid-19, we have decided to go for a local campaign.   We put out a tender for a PR agency and we are in the final stages of selecting one,” Fernando stated.  

 Speaking further, she added that tourism authorities together with the Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medical Services have prepared a detailed health protocol for local travellers, and the PR firm would play a vital role in educating the general public to follow this protocol.  

 The local tourism campaign also comes amidst the absence of the global tourism campaign. The airport closure necessitated further delays to the already long-delayed global tourism campaign of Sri Lanka. After years of delays under consecutive governments, the campaign which was scheduled to be launched in January 2021 is now expected to be delayed further by several months.  

 Following the closure of the airport in March for international travellers and the subsequent islandwide lockdown after the local outbreak of the virus, tourism businesses were facing severe financial issues as neither international nor local travellers could travel within the country.  

 However, after the lifting of the seven-week long islandwide lockdown, local tourism began to pick up, giving hope to tourism businesses. By end-September, according to The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) President Sanath Ukwatte, occupancy rates of most of the hotels were around 20%.  

 Nevertheless, after the recent “second wave” of the virus, which began on 4 October with the detection of the Minuwangoda cluster and the subsequent curfews, local tourism too has been largely paralysed,    The Sunday Morning Business    learns.  

 Sri Lanka’s tourism sector is among the top three foreign exchange-earning sources of the country. Even before the closure of the airport, Sri Lanka was struggling to attract tourists, mainly due to stringent travel restrictions imposed in China in the early weeks of this year to mitigate the spread of the virus. China is among the top five tourism-generating markets of Sri Lanka. 

 Tourism arrivals had been gradually recovering after the Easter attacks and the reported arrivals into the country stood at 1.9 million in 2019, compared to 2.3 million in 2018. This year, January arrivals were 228,434, a year-on-year drop of 6.5%, while February arrivals were 207,507, a year-on-year drop of 17.7%. March arrivals dropped to 71,370 compared to the 244,328 arrivals during the same period last year.

,,Rice scam: Investigations halted,business," Rishad Bathiudeen involvement?  

 The Government has abandoned investigations into a large-scale rice scam which had taken place continuously by exploiting the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Pakistan, while the Pakistan-Sri Lanka FTA (PSFTA) fell under the purview of former Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen,    The Sunday Morning Business    reliably learns.  

 The investigations, which were specifically focused on several private companies which had profited from this scam, have not even been discussed of late, well placed sources at the Ministry of Trade told us last week. 

 “There has been no discussion about the investigation into the scam that was exposed about a month ago. The authorities have proceeded with new plans to import rice under the said FTA,” our source said. 

 The permit to import rice under the PSFTA has now been given to Lanka Sathosa, a state-owned retail network business in Sri Lanka.  

 When    The Sunday Morning Business    exclusively reported the rice scam under the FTA on 27 August, a ministry official told us that the Ministry had launched an investigation into the scam and is in the process of obtaining the names of the private businesses that were part of the scam.

 The Ministry also alleged that the scam had taken place under former Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen, under whose purview the PSFTA came into being during this five-year period. All our attempts to contact Bathiudeen proved futile last month. 

 Thereafter, he was arrested following a six-day manhunt involving six police teams as he was charged with criminal misappropriation of public funds and the violation of election laws with regard to the transportation of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Ceylon Transport Board (CTB) buses to vote at the 2019 Presidential Election.   
  The PSFTA permits the importation of an annual quota of 6,000 metric tonnes (MT) of the PK385 variety of basmati rice or super kernel basmati from Pakistan on a duty-free basis.   
  However, a recent quality verification test conducted on rice, which was imported from Pakistan last year but is still stuck at the Port, has been found to be an inferior basmati lookalike rice variety. Although the rice that had been imported is of inferior quality, it has an appearance similar to basmati or super kernel basmati.   
  The scam had been conducted by a group of private businesses with the support of state institutions, which were provided the necessary permits to import rice from Pakistan.   
  “The permit to import rice was with several state institutions. The private businesses had got together and ordered rice through these licences. When it arrived in Sri Lanka, they would sell it to wholesale and retail rice sellers, mainly in Pettah. So they have misused the FTA to maximise profits by importing sub-standard rice and misrepresenting it as basmati,” a Ministry of Trade official told us last month when the scam came to the surface.   
  According to the official, the sole purpose of the scam was to achieve a wider profit margin by selling a kilogramme of inferior-quality rice for the price of a kilogramme of basmati, which is generally an expensive rice variety.   
  The PSFTA became operational from 12 June 2005 onwards. Under the FTA, Sri Lanka and Pakistan had agreed to offer preferential market access to each other’s exports by way of tariff concessions.   
  Accordingly, Sri Lanka enjoys duty-free market access on 206 products in the Pakistani market, including tea, rubber, and coconut. Pakistan in return has duty-free access on 102 products in the Sri Lankan market, including oranges, basmati rice, and engineering goods.   
  The agreement mentions that during the month of October every year, the Department of Commerce would publish a newspaper advertisement in all three languages on the availability of the annual quota of the 6,000 MT of the PK385 variety of basmati rice or super kernel basmati for duty-free importation during the following calendar year (January-December). Importers who were willing to import rice under the PSFTA registered with the Department and imported rice under a duty waiver.

,,Second quarter GDP data only in 2021?,business,"By Madhusha Thavapalakumar

 Sri Lanka is facing the very real possibility of not being able to release second quarter GDP (Gross Domestic Product) data for 2020 within the year, even though it is usually released every year before mid-September. 

 In mid-October, issuing a press statement, the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) said that second quarter GDP data will be released on 15 December, along with GDP data of the third quarter of 2020. The reason provided for the delay was the seven-week-long curfew imposed through half of the second quarter, which resulted in some economic activities taking place in ways different to their norms. 

 When    The Sunday Morning Business    contacted the Department to confirm if the 15 December deadline would be met, DCS Director General Dr. I.R. Bandara said that it is uncertain, as only 50% of DCS employees are currently reporting to work and that too on a rotational basis. 

 “Our ability to release GDP data by 15 December, as promised, depends on the ongoing situation. We will try to release it on the said date somehow, but it may be further delayed,” Bandara added. 

 Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) parliamentarian Dr. Harsha de Silva, in a tweet on 17 October, charged that this is the first time since quarterly publishing where Sri Lanka’s GDP figures have not been published by a government and termed it a “disgrace”. 

 When asked whether the DCS had been influenced or pressured to hold back the GDP data or to manipulate the figures to produce more favourable data, she gave the following reply. 

 “The DCS is still in the process of collecting data for the second quarter and we have been advised to study the gathered data further by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and the Ministry of Finance.” 

 In the mid-October press release, the DCS also said that international consultants are required to achieve accurate data. 

 “It is imperative to discuss with international consultants the methods of estimating the output value of certain industry and services activities. It was also decided to collect data on some of the above economic activities from other sources,” the release stated. 

 Meanwhile, Bandara noted that the DCS had a number of webinars with international consultants on how other countries are calculating their GDP amidst the pandemic. Nevertheless, she stated that no changes would be made to existing methodologies used by DCS to capture the data. 

 In a second tweet in response to the press release issued by the DCS, MP de Silva stated: “Come on DG! You cannot give such lame excuses that you need a foreign consultant to calculate GDP. India, Thailand, Vietnam, and so many others have already published 2020 2Q. You have now completely lost your credibility.” 

 Responding to de Silva’s tweet, Bandara stated that it is not necessary for Sri Lanka to consult international consultants and that the consultations so far have been merely for knowledge-sharing purposes. 

 In terms of de Silva’s latter claim that India, Thailand, and Vietnam have released their GDP estimates, she noted that these countries have a statistical business registry where businesses are registered. 

 “With the statistical business registry, it is easy to capture GDP data. We have already prepared a cabinet paper to set up a similar registry in Sri Lanka. We are working on it,” Bandara added. 

 The reason for the absence of a statistical business registry all these years is mainly the inconsistency of registered businesses in Sri Lanka, according to her. 

 De Silva also stated that internal sources had informed him that the GDP contraction for the second quarter is a shocking -17%. A World Bank report compiled prior to the detection of the new and largest Covid-19 cluster in Sri Lanka projects the island’s economy to contract by -6.7% this year, which would point to a far more severe contraction if the ongoing situation in the country is taken into account. 

 National economic data of Sri Lanka for the first quarter of 2020 was released on the night of 4 August, a day prior to the general election, and it showed that the economy had contracted by 1.6%. As the data was released following a highly unusual delay, this led to intense speculation as to the reasons for said delay. Many opined that data was being held back intentionally till the end of the election, which was on 5 August, so as to prevent any political disadvantage. However, both the DCS and the CBSL denied this allegation in August and attributed the delay purely to the pandemic.

,,Havelock City commercial complex opening in September,business," Bolstered by a recent financing arrangement with DFCC Bank, Havelock City's commercial complex, Mireka Tower, is set to finish construction on 31 July 2021 and officially open to the public by September the same year. 

 Overseas Realty (Ceylon) PLC Group Director and CEO Pravir Samarasinghe told    The Sunday Morning Business    on Thursday (22) that the 50-storey office tower and 200,000 sq. ft. shopping mall was set to finish construction by March 2021. However, with the initial outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in Sri Lanka and the long curfew that followed, the project got pushed back to July 2021. 

 On 14 October, DFCC Bank entered into a Rs. 9 billion revolving financing arrangement for the Havelock City Commercial Development Project, a fully owned entity of Overseas Realty (Ceylon) and the owner of the World Trade Center (WTC) in Colombo. 

 DFCC Bank Director and CEO Lakshman Silva, commenting on the financing facility, said: “This transaction further stands testament to the ability we have to close large transactions and manifests our strong and continued commitment to support in navigating the current financial uncertainties and challenges posed.” 

 He explained that none of their plans for the project has since changed, with the company proceeding with the Urban Development Authority (UDA)-approved design. 

 “Sri Lanka's current Covid-19 status will not impact us since 95% of our staff are living on the project site itself. We have 600 contractors staying on site and they do not move around, and we do not plan on hiring any new people.” 

 Samarasinghe added that the property will be for leasing only, and has already managed to lease 50% of the shopping mall space and 10% of the office tower space. Moreover, the tower will also provide its residents with several other facilities including a gymnasium, training rooms, meeting rooms, and an executive club/sky bar. 

 Mireka Tower was first announced for pre-leasing in 2019 and the development last announced the completion of the tower’s roof slab last August. The tower is set to be a 600,000 sq. ft.,  premium “Grade A” office space that is LEED Gold-certified and is being designed by Singapore-based P&amp;T Group, while construction work is being done by the China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC). 

 The development is part of Havelock City which claims to be Sri Lanka’s largest mixed development project, built on 18 acres of prime land Colombo.

,,Birth of the 20th Amendment and death of a basketball legend,business,"  Why planes must have two pilots and warning systems  

 After much elaborate drama, vehement opposition, and toing and froing, the 20  th   Amendment to the Constitution has been passed with a resounding majority in Parliament. The contents of this amendment and the seismic shift it creates to our governance system reminds me of a story from early this year, before global headlines had begun to be dominated by Covid-19 – namely, the tragic helicopter crash on 26 January in Los Angeles which caused the death of basketball legend Kobe Bryant and his daughter. 

 he National Transport Safety Board (NTSB) of the US has come up with a 1,700-page report on the crash. While it provides no final conclusion, many aviation experts believe the pilot got disoriented, confused the pitch altitude, and thought he was ascending when he was descending. This is not a novel phenomenon in the field of aviation and is always a possibility as you are in the air without visual references. At least, that was the reasoning at surface level. But when we go a little in depth, there are two main factors highlighted by experts and the report (1). 

           The helicopter Kobe Bryant flew (Sikorsky-S76B) is operationally a hi-tech machine with a sophisticated flight-deck for two pilots. However, on this unfortunate day, it was operated by only one pilot. According to NTSB guidelines, any helicopter that carries more than five passengers must be a dual pilot operation, but in this case, nine innocent passengers died in the crash. A guideline for dual pilot operations was imposed post the investigations of a similar crash in the Gulf of Mexico in 2004. The simple reason to have a dual pilot operation is simply a check and balance mechanism to minimise the probability of human error in decision-making in flight.  
           The second reason was that the helicopter that hit the ground did not have a Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS) installed.  

 A dual pilot operation and installing a TAWS are simply just guidelines. Operating a flight without following those guidelines were not illegal, but the cost of not following the guidelines was proven to be human life. 

 When I think about Sri Lanka’s Constitution and the proposed constitutional reforms which affect the economy and our structure of governance, I think of a helicopter operation and the tragic crash Kobe Bryant had to face. 

 Checks and balances and processes are in place for a reason, and till things go wrong, we may not see the importance of their presence. In Sri Lanka’s context, our pilot is the policymaking unit and the 21 million population are the passengers who have to be safe onboard and flown to the destination of prosperity in their own lives. So we have to have systems in place where the aeroplane can be landed safely, even if key decision-makers in the cockpit get disoriented. 

The discussion on the 20th Amendment has been evaluated in that spirit, in particular from an economic perspective. That is why the checks and balances are vital and a mechanism has to be established to minimise the probability of human error, similar to the dual pilot model and the TAWS system. Otherwise, it is natural that in a cloud of “political power”, individuals may disconnect with the ground reality and make decisions to accelerate the momentum in the wrong direction. 

 Our economy is already at a critical stage where we can’t afford to make any miscalculations. For example, there has been a rise in bond yields in secondary market bonds of Sri Lanka following the announcement of the changes in the 20th Amendment. One possibility for this could be the uncertainties created by the 20th Amendment with regard to checks and balances for the broader economy. 

 The executive powers vested with the President have to be looked at in the spirit of “responsibility”. Political power provides the decision-making ability, and yet we should not underestimate the “responsibility” factor that is interconnected with power, which may impact millions of lives. What do we do with political power franchised by the people to develop their economies? This is the vital question. The three arms of the executive, legislature, and judiciary are the governance equivalents of a dual pilot and the TAWS safety net: The “executive” as the chief pilot and “legislature”, lead by the Prime Minister, as the core pilot have to work hand in hand in ensuring that there are measures to recheck whether we do the right thing. Then there has to be an independent judiciary to resolve any conflict. If Sri Lanka is to prosper, it is essential that we protect these checks and balances. 

 It has been proven multiple times in Sri Lanka and across the world that when citizens are empowered to make their own decisions and choices, the chances for success and prosperity are greater. A single government trying to understand the needs and aspirations, motivations, behaviours, lifestyles, etc. of 21 million people is simply impossible. That is why the structure has to be organised in a way where people are empowered to make their own economic decisions and competition has to be in place along with a level playing field in order to ensure that hard work is incentivised and rewarded. 

 All constitutional reforms have to be in the view of what is in it for people to make their own choices and how it affects the creation of a level playing field. 

 As highlighted in this column less than a month ago on 27 September, the importance of the Auditor General having the ability to audit state-owned enterprises (SOEs) has to be appreciated. However, just the powers for the Auditor General will not ensure SOE governance as the corruption in SOEs is systemic and incredibly pervasive. The Government has to consider greater reform and should consider steps such as listing strategic SOEs at the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and establishing a “Temasek model” for the governance of all SOEs. 

 The general Sri Lankan sentiment is that merely appointing a political leader or moving a constitutional reform would provide solutions to all problems. When the amendments were brought to increase female representation at local government level, many were of the opinion that it would solve the problem of female underrepresentation. Unfortunately, what happened in reality was far different, with some women contesting elections simply to enable their husbands to effectively take over once elected. It is required that Sri Lankan political leadership initiates a comprehensive economic reform plan if we are to have any hope of development. 

 What we do with the “powers” we have in hand is more important than what “powers” we install in one single position. In exercising power, we need a system to make sure we exercise it in the right way. 

 Sri Lankans’ experience in the economic context over time is that the powers granted by people have not been utilised for the right objectives, and in many cases, the same power they have provided have limited people’s own right and freedom to enjoy a prosperous economic life. 

 After the 20th Amendment, with new powers installed, “economic freedom” is a concept that we can start building into our country. It has been shown that countries with higher economic freedom, where people are provided with the independence and opportunity to earn higher incomes, generally experience a higher quality of life. Poverty levels reduce and the most vulnerable sections of society are able to have economic security. 

 Per capita income and economic freedom quartile 

 Sri Lanka has been ranked 83rd on the Economic Freedom Index and we have a long way to go. Let's hope that with checks and balances and executive powers, Sri Lanka will establish systems and guidelines such as dual pilot systems in aviation and TAWS in the form of institutions to incentivise people to work harder and become prosperous, so that we can prosper as a country.

,,Can technology save our economy from Covid?,business,"  “Parliament is not categorised in the gazette as a public space” – Health Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi in Parliament.  
   
 The country needs people to work and earn money, for themselves, for the government, and for the nation. But people use this as an excuse to gather around, shop, and attend weddings and religious events, and thus increase the risk of exposure to Covid. We know we have to prevent public gatherings and so we have blanket curfews in our most populous districts, effectively cutting off most of our revenue-generating capabilities.  

 As the country goes into a vicious tailspin with authorities battling valiantly to contain the latest spread of the Covid pandemic, let us examine whether the country really needs to go into a full lockdown, if existing inexpensive technology is utilised in a practical manner to continue working on a limited scale, while also limiting the spread of the disease until the vaccines expected within the next few months deliver humanity from this evil. 

   
  Unnecessary gatherings     
 Why does Parliament have to meet at all? Why can’t we take a cue from some of the more rational global cultures and use online technology for our lawmakers to meet and discuss? Many companies have switched to this, using Zoom, MS Teams, Slack, Trello, Houseparty, Skype, and many other software that were quickly put on the market or already existed. You can interact with people any place in the world that has internet connectivity. Individuals do it; small, medium and large-sized businesses do it; other governments do it. So why isn’t everyone who practically can, doing so? 

 Of course, you can’t move all activities online. A factory with a thousand employees cannot produce rubber tyres through Zoom. So there are clear limitations, which can only be partially mitigated through the use of physical distancing of two metres, wearing masks, constant washing of hands, regular temperature checks, frequent disinfection of surfaces and objects that people touch, etc. 

 But you can certainly mitigate matters and curb the rapidity of the pandemic’s spread. You simply need to target locations where people tend to gather in large numbers; e.g. fish markets, vegetable markets, police stations, banks, supermarkets, government offices such as the Pensions Department, etc. Look into what methodologies and technologies can be effective, and can be implemented both rapidly and cost effectively. 

 Lethargic bureaucrats may argue that parliamentary standing orders or constitutional stipulations require Members of Parliament (MPs) to gather together. The simple answer to that is that Parliament is empowered by the people to make laws and change laws. If that’s too complicated, then party leaders can simply consult each other online, brief their party lawmakers, and have an electronic vote. Get into the 21st Century, people! This isn’t some village council two thousand years ago where everyone has to gather and raise their hands. 

   
  Appointment and scheduling system  
 Why do organisations make people wait, gathering them in large numbers in the midst of a pandemic? Simply have an online system to schedule appointments. Remember that Sri Lanka is a nation with more active mobile phones than people. You also don’t need smartphones – an automated SMS-based system can give out appointments. That way, people will spend the minimum amount of time inside your building. 

 The appointment and scheduling system is an excellent solution for government offices, public agencies, and corporates which actively enforce measures for social distancing imposed by the Government due to the Covid-19 virus. It is Ideal for other public and social authorities such as nursing homes and more. 
 
           Of course, many people are used to human contact. But this needs to be shelved in the face of a pandemic. More than half, 53%, of clients in corporate banking choose to go to a branch or visit a banker to open a bank account. Furthermore, 58% said they would prefer to apply in a face-to-face meeting for a loan (Greenwich Research, 2020).  
 
   
  Appointment and scheduling system for government  
 The development of public and private sector appointment and scheduling applications allows users to make their own appointments. The online scheduler helps constituents to easily make, amend, and cancel their own appointments at the click of a button from virtually any place that they would have to visit. It is a cost-effective way to tackle multiple goals simultaneously, greatly enhancing time management and efficiency as well as disease prevention. 

 Implementing an appointment and scheduling system for the government and the private sectors also appeals to the general public and squashes bureaucratic inefficiency, all the while allowing staff the flexibility to concentrate on community-enhancing non-administrative tasks. There are conditions for co-ordinated reservation of appointments everywhere.  

 Whether at the Immigration Department or at a hospital, unrestricted numbers of guests and visitors can not be permitted, in order to ensure the health and safety of all people. This is especially true of places where more elderly people gather, such as retirement houses. The management teams must assign special spaces for visits so that after each appointment, disinfection is encouraged and cleaned up to avoid viral infections from causing havoc. 

 Researchers have suggested that you should eliminate long queues and vulnerable people, even before you switch to expensive ventilating solutions, in order to avoid the spread of Covid-19. Holding virtual queues is also the best way to maintain the social distance in order to minimise physical waiting and excessive crowds. The risk of spreading the virus is minimal if there are no clients standing in line. The facilities can still be provided without contact; and the correct queue structure can also be maintained. As far as an agent can accept email and telephone requests, he/she can add visitors to the virtual queues and maintain the workflow accordingly by using the queue management system. 

 The advantage of the queue management system is that it efficiently handles the customer traffic. It lets you know how many rental slots you have and gives you power over the guests simultaneously. One important point is that managers must identify points in their offices that are in high consumer demand and assign employees according to consumer demand and availability. In addition, tracking is also a vital part of deciding the number of visitors awaiting their turn. But with the queue management system, all this becomes seamless. It provides data like open counters, availability of workers, number of counters, etc.  

 Examples from Malaysia: In partnership with Queuemed, EncoreMed, Bookdoc, and DoctorOnCall, an appointment system is now in operation and has been extended to selected health clinics in the federal territories of Kuala Lumpur and Selangor. 

   
  Current problem  
 
           Streamline process:   An organisation needs an overall evaluation of its activities to optimise work processes and to improve the workflow. The use of office paper by government sectors, including the use, scanning, and archiving of forms, should be assessed. The financial services industry must define areas for change that contribute to digitisation of manual processes and physical paperwork elimination from order forms, onboard documents, and agreements.  
           Covid risk:   How do government and local authorities respond to Covid-19? What emergency management steps and risks should be considered from public health initiatives to personnel guidelines?   
           Cramped waiting rooms:   The problem with public offices across the globe is the old system of people who come, queue up, or take tickets, and then wait in a crowded area. In most countries, it is now compulsory for anyone on their premises to comply with social distancing criteria of one or even two metres. But having people waiting half an hour, even tow metres apart, increases the risk considerably in contrast to having each person in the building for just five minutes.  
           SOP implementation:   The key main reason for the increase in Covid-19 cases was complacency in keeping with current standard operating procedures (SOP).  
 
   
  Corporates/banks  
 
           Has the private sector really done enough to protect their own staff and their customers? Has the waiting time of customers been reduced to the bare minimum? Experience says no. Customers still have to queue up inside banks.   
           Banks need to encourage consumers to use ATMs, and mobile and online banking services instead.  
           Relationship managers must work towards establishing relations without meeting each other.  
           Reduce the number of persons required for unnecessary validation and authorisation. Don’t keep customers waiting in your bank. Automate. Streamline.  
           Reduce the number of common surfaces used – pens, books, counters, etc.  
 
   

 The behavioural improvements in each area of life are certain once the outbreak of Covid-19 is reopened. And a ""new normal"" is already emerging in the case of banks and credit unions. Almost every customer has been forced to switch to online and mobile banking for its most frequent transactions because branch lobbies are shuttered and dramatically restrict personal services, other than branch closeups. 

 As a customer’s experience gets faster, quicker, and more stable than traditional banking, with these types of digital banking, the impact will become more permanent. 

 The digital age of recent decades has shaped all facets of our lives, including our banking practises. Over the years, banks and credit unions have adopted ATMs, online banks, mobile banking, etc. But many still favour the personalised experience of a branch visit even with this development. Even today, over half of those using a bank or a credit union plan to visit their branch for their own business. However, digital banking is going to play a greater role in this new era than before. Indeed, most financial institutions would almost definitely concentrate on the digital future. Whereas social distance and homestay intervention may gradually have taken place, the transition is quickly accelerated. 

   
  Practical solutions  
 
           Term scheduling of agent schedules and resource availability tools for setting up, configuring, and controlling them  
           Use an app that provides mobile users with the option of scheduling and checking-in appointments and locating offices, and viewing queue information and other functions can be introduced to a management app  
           Operating time, availability, overbooking, the form of appointment and period configuration interface for the manager, schedule ownership, access and management permissions, and more  
           Calendar owner interface for calendar opening and closing, agent updates, rescheduling appointment blocks, etc.  
           Call centre agent interface focused on customers’ requests and location for national scheduling  
           A web interface, which can be tailored to respective corporate or government websites. It can be incorporated into the website's office locator as well as online campaigns by using an online appointment programme for the clients, through the company website or a system-hosted web server  
           Lock mechanism prevents simultaneous bookings from separate networks on double requests  
           Send automatic messages to clients, including appointment information, planning notes, cancellation or reschedule links, and other actions. Maintain automatic records. These recalls can be printed when the appointment is scheduled or emailed/sent as an SMS a couple of hours before the appointment  
           Microsoft Exchange/Outlook data integration appointment  
           Scalable for all departments, offices, services, and officers  
           Each setup is parameter-based, does not require programming, takes place over remotely secured network connections, and directly affects all offices and sites  
 
   
  Solution advantages  
   
 
           Maximises the potential of appointment planning by offering a clear and uniform timetable for all customer engagement platforms, including self-service   
           Reduces running costs by simplifying scheduling and improving the performance of operators  
           Improves customer loyalty and experience by simple-to-use, self-service scheduling that takes into account agent skills and service availability   
           Allows, if possible, to match customers and inquiries to individual agents; to provide visitors with messages and directions prior to their arrival at an appointment, and to schedule agents for their appointment  
           Adds value if agents are needed as part of local and federal policies to comply with performance standards  
 
   
  Conclusion  
 To sum up, many prominent and important businesses haven’t acted forcefully enough to protect their daily workflows through social distancing. The use of the appointment and scheduling systems (mobile and web solutions) will substantially reduce the risk of infection. This would lead to a drop in the number of virus cases. It is therefore vital for organisations to quickly test out a queue management system; secure the workers and customers and act to stop Covid-19 in every possible way. Find the most practical way to provide the best quality and maintain a satisfaction rate to the customer.

,,Tourism amidst Covid: Lessons for Sri Lanka from Seychelles,business,"    Sri Lanka’s dreams of reopening the country to international tourists seems to move further out of reach as the country’s confirmed Covid-19 cases keep rising at an alarming rate and curfew is being imposed in several districts. This is further confirmed by officials in the local tourism industry, such as the President of the Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO), Mahen Kariyawasan, who claimed that there is still no fixed date for the country to reopen its borders. 

""Their main concern was whether our destination was safe, so we had to prove to them that we were safe; and secondly, our research shows that the people want to get out of their homes and experience nature, which is something they took for granted before"",  Seychelles Tourism Board CEO Sherin Francis 

 While Sri Lanka’s tourism industry suffers under the weight of the Covid-19 pandemic, some competing markets have already opened their borders and are welcoming international tourists. Seychelles, a competing tourist destination to Sri Lanka in the region, opened its borders to a select group of international markets in August; and received over 3,000 international tourists within the last two months. 

 The 115-island nation in the western Indian Ocean attributes its quick recovery to the low number of positive cases and zero deaths, with the country having no active cases since May. According to officials in the country, this has motivated several international airlines to begin regular flights to the island destination. These include airlines such as Emirates, Ethiopian Airlines, Edelweiss, and, as of October, British Airways and Kenya Airways. 

 In 2019, Seychelles hosted a total of 384,204 tourists according to the island nation’s National Bureau of Statistics data, with around 70,000 of the tourists being from Germany, followed by France, the UK, Northern Ireland, Italy, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Switzerland, respectively. This has resulted in the country’s tourism industry contributing 55% to its GDP (gross domestic product) and amounts to 75% of their foreign exchange earnings. 

 Since the first positive case of Covid-19 was announced back in 14 March, Seychelles, similar to most countries, went into lockdown; and their cases peaked on 6 April with a case total of 11. However by 1 June the country experienced a lower number of cases and announced a move to reopen the country to tourists from 19 selected countries, with another 17 countries put under consideration. 

 These countries varied from nations in the Middle East, Asia, Europe, and the South Pacific, but they all shared something in common; they were all considered “low risk” by Seychelles authorities, due to low incidences of cases. 

 As of 1 October, this list includes Australia, Austria, Cambodia, Canada, China, Cyprus, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Malaysia, Mauritius, Monaco, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Portugal, Qatar, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand,  Vietnam, and even Sri Lanka. 

 During an international webinar held by the Centre for Excellence in Travel, Tourism, and Hospitality in Sri Lanka themed “Tourism Now and Then” held on 16 October, the Chief Executive Officer of the Seychelles Tourism Board, Sherin Francis stated that the first thing they did before reopening for tourists was to do research on their target audience. Based on this research, she explained that a lot of international tourists still had travel in their minds, and all they had to do was make plans that fit the current needs of the tourists. 

 “Their main concern was whether our destination was safe, so we had to prove to them that we were safe; and secondly, our research shows that the people want to get out of their homes and experience nature, which is something they took for granted before. We are a small island nation, so we are highly dependent on tourism, and because of this we had to meet the aspirations and the requirements of these new travellers.” 

 Francis stated that their strategy was built on three pillars, with the first being the health of the population. The country’s first effort was to ensure that they had the capacity and the facilities to deal with the pandemic, and that the population was safe and healthy; therefore, they decided on going into immediate lockdown. 

 The second pillar came in the form of the Seychelles cohesion, which aimed to build a strong community which was prepared for the eventuality of a second wave or a reintroduction of the virus in the islands. 

 “As of May, we have no active cases but of course opening our borders means exposing our country to a certain level of risk. So we set up a national framework to deal with the reopening of our borders.” 

 The first layer of foundation of this new framework was to ensure that all the sectors across the country were ready for the reopening. This meant that every establishment, from local shops to churches, had a procedure to operate in this new normal, and according to Francis, all these establishments have embraced these new procedures, such as social distancing, and it has become a part of their daily operations. 

 “We were confident that as a country we could deal with the current situation, so in June we started welcoming private plans, and on 1 August we opened the country for international flights. This is when we introduced a few more risk managers, and put money into safety measures.” 

 She stated that a PCR test 48 hours before coming to Seychelles was a mandatory requirement from all the travellers, and will be vetted by the country’s public health authorities along with the travel applications, to check its authenticity.  Prior to arriving at the airport, the travellers will be required to download the country’s travel app, which is accessible online, and this will be used in their screening procedure once they land. 

 Another major risk filter the country has introduced is that tourists can only stay in certified establishments and have access to safe certified services on the islands. Francis stated that all the personnel in these establishments and services are sent through rigorous training to ensure that the procedures they have in place are followed. Each establishment comes up with their own standard operating procedure, according to guidelines given by the Seychelles’ Ministry of Tourism and public health authorities. 

 This is further reinforced by regular training to boost the confidence of the public, so that they can handle themselves. Moreover, the establishments also have to conduct daily symptom checks on any in-house visitors until they leave, and report daily to the public health authorities. 

 “We have also recently developed a travel bubble with seven of our core markets, so that even if these markets have a higher level of risk, we allow them into the country with stricter measures instead of moving them to the not-permitted list.” 

 Francis stated that these high-risk tourists have a short list of specific hotels from the list of certified hotels, where they have to stay for a minimum of five days. She explained that these do not count as quarantine facilities because they are not confined to their rooms, and instead can walk around the hotel premises. Staff in these special hotels are trained to handle these high-risk tourists. 

 “After the five-day stay, we test again and if it is negative, then we let them enjoy the destination as they would normally do but with some simple steps and measures for them to follow to keep themselves and everyone safe.” 

 Furthermore, she stated that they have a Covid task force which meets once or twice a week, overseeing all these procedures, and work closely with all the current airlines entering the country to ensure that the tourists’ travel experience to their destination is as seamless as possible. She went on to state that their current airport procedure is smoother than it was pre-Covid, due to the level of attention they pay to the customer service part. 

 “The journey to our destination is a pleasant one, because these tourists are coming for a holiday and not to a clinic or hospital. So we are being very mindful of our customers’ journey, because it is a very important part of the process.” 

 Francis explained that their goal is to attract tourists for long stays, and they have launched a marketing campaign to promote long stays. The country’s Tourism Board is now encouraging visitors to use the island nation as a home office, combining a bit of work with a holiday visit during a time when much of the world is embracing work-from-home policies as part of Covid-19 prevention measures.

,,Debt trap: Made in China or made in Sri Lanka?,business,"Should our worry be a repeat of Hambantota Port or repaying our sovereign bonds? 
 A 222 km-long expressway connecting Colombo and the South, a state-of-the-art theatre called Nelum Pokuna in the heart of Colombo with a seating capacity of over 1,200, a largely dysfunctional Norochcholai Power Plant, the iconic but yet to be fully operational Lotus Tower, an international airport once globally recognised as the “world’s emptiest airport”, and a port in Hambantota which has been leased to the financier of the project; these are among the most prominent symbols of China’s financial influence on Sri Lanka over the past 15 years.  

 In spite of the fact that the majority of Sri Lanka’s external debt is in the form of International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs), Sri Lanka is often globally portrayed as an example of China’s controversial “debt-trap diplomacy”, particularly after the leasing of the Hambantota Port. Whenever Sri Lanka turns towards China for a loan, almost always, the answer from the lender has been a hearty “yes!”, even when its other Asian neighbours have turned down credit requests. 

 In this context,    The Sunday Morning Business    decided to take a look at China’s loans to Sri Lanka, the diplomatic strategies attached to these loans, whether we should worry about China’s “unwavering” support, and whether we are in danger of seeing another Hambantota Port scenario. 

   
 Game of Loans     
 The Government headed by current Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa aligned himself with China early on, and strengthened this relationship after China came forward to support Sri Lanka in ending its decades-long civil war and rebuilding the nation’s infrastructure in the post-war period.  

 Since then, every single time, the Sri Lankan Government turns towards China for financial assistance; the Government successfully secured the money, be it in the Rajapaksa Government or the Maithripala Sirisena Government. 

 Geopolitical and economic analysts have attributed this willingness of China to its tendency to lend easy, addictive money as opposed to western nations and multilateral lenders which attach stringent conditions to their assistance. 


 In the past 15 years alone, the country has borrowed over $ 34 billion from various international financial organisations and countries, and 33% of these total loans were obtained from China followed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Japan, the World Bank (WB), and India.  

 Sri Lanka’s debt can be put into three categories, namely multilateral, bilateral, and financial markets. The share of the multilateral loans in Sri Lanka’s entire external debt portfolio is 23%, bilateral loans are 17.7%, while loans from financial markets make up the bulk of it with 59.4%, according to a study done by Advocata Institute, an independent policy think tank in Colombo.  

 In terms of bilateral debt, loans obtained from Japan constitute 9.7% of the total bilateral loans while loans from India are 2.4% and loans from China are 2.2%. These figures suggest that China is a negligible part of not just our entire external debt portfolio, but our bilateral lenders. 

 However, the Export-Import Bank of China (EXIM Bank), which is owned by the Chinese Government, contributes about 7.4% of Sri Lanka’s debt. In a tightly state-controlled nation such as China, borrowing from a government entity is as good as borrowing from the Chinese Government, and with this included, China’s entire stake in Sri Lanka’s international debt portfolio climbs to 9.6%. 

 Therefore, Sri Lanka’s external debt as of end June 2020 was Rs. 6.55 trillion and China’s share in the total debt was around 9% at the end of last year according to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) data. Nevertheless, a report compiled by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) stated that as of November 2019, China contributed to about 15% of Sri Lanka’s total external debt.  

 While the largest share of Sri Lanka’s debt is in financial market loans, constituting 59.4% of all debt, the lion’s share of these market loans are in dollar-denominated ISBs, amounting to 42.7%. Therefore, Sri Lanka has colossal sums of ISB debt payments coming up annually for the next 10 years. 

 Even though the borrowing procedure in terms of Chinese loans is quite easy, according to Verite Research, Chinese loans have the highest interest rate with an average rate of 3.3% per annum compared to other lending  nations such as Japan and India.  

 In terms of the maturity period, loans from China again prove to be unfavourable with an average maturity period of about 18 years while WB loans and loans from India have maturity periods of 24 years, ADB loans have 25 years, and loans from Japan have 34 years, the highest maturity period of a lender country. 

 In fact, several countries have been studying Sri Lanka to avoid becoming the Sri Lanka of China.  
   

 Debt-trap diplomacy is when the lending country intentionally extends excessive credit to the borrowing country, inducing the borrower into a debt trap. The intention is to extract either political or economic concessions from the borrowing country when the country is unable to service the debt.  

 Even the term “debt-trap diplomacy” has been around and applied to many lending practices of various countries; in recent years it has been increasingly associated with China. The term was in fact coined initially to describe China’s lending practices. 

 Under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China’s loans to developing countries grew considerably. It invested billions of dollars including in Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and even in South Africa.   
   
Walking into a trap?    

 It would not be incorrect to say that the Hambantota Port is the most notorious example of debt-trap diplomacy by China in Asia. The Sri Lankan Government built the port despite a government-appointed task force rejecting a feasibility study on the project. A few years later, a debt-ridden Sri Lankan Government ended up leasing a controlling stake to China due the country’s inability in paying back the loan. 

 Today, Sri Lanka has neither the port nor the relief from the loans it borrowed from China. The port in Hambantota, known as the Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port, was built utilising Chinese financial assistance to the tune of $ 1.5 billion. This particular credit facility is the main reason for Sri Lanka’s recognition as a victim of China’s debt trap. 

 The Government felt the need to develop the infrastructure of the country, particularly in the South, and building a port was part of the plan. Initially, the Sri Lankan Government turned towards India, its closest neighbour, for financial assistance. However, as India turned down the request, Sri Lanka reached out to China, by whom the request was happily accepted.  

 According to Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Reconnecting Asia Project Director Jonathan Hillman, constructing a port at Hambantota has been part of Sri Lanka’s official development plans since at least 2002.  

 In 2003, SNC Lavalin, a French engineering firm, completed a feasibility study for the port. A Sri Lankan government-appointed task force reviewed and ultimately rejected the study, faulting it for ignoring the port’s potential impact on the Colombo Port, which in recent years has handled roughly 95% of Sri Lanka’s international trade.  

 “Hambantota’s port did not appear overnight, but resulted from a series of Sri Lankan government decisions. Many Chinese-funded projects in Sri Lanka have been unsolicited, but Hambantota’s port is not one of them,” he stated in a publication on this topic.  

 The construction work of the port with the loan from China began in 2008 and it was opened for operations in November 2010, identifying itself as the second largest port in Sri Lanka. However, it wasn’t fruitful for the Government as the port made an operating profit of just $ 1.8 million in 2016, even after six years of operation. 

 This made Sri Lanka’s debt repayments to China extremely difficult to fulfil. As such, in July 2017, then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe signed a 99-year lease agreement with China Merchant Port Holdings for $ 1.12 billion. It is notable that this amount is lower than the sum obtained from China for the construction of the port. In the end, Sri Lanka had neither the port nor the relief from the $ 1.5 billion loan it borrowed from China for this purpose.  

   
  Another Hambantota?   
   

 China cannot singlehandedly pull Sri Lanka out of its large pile of debt. In the case of Sri Lanka falling into a state where it cannot service its debt in time, requesting a moratorium for the loans it took from China or China restructuring Sri Lanka’s debt may not help as Sri Lanka’s exposure to loans from China is in single-digit levels (according to CBSL statistics) while over 40% of the external debt is in the form of ISBs. Which means the country would still have to find a way to repay its ISBs. 

 With the state our economy is in at the moment, that is a daunting challenge.
